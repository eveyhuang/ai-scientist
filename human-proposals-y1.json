            "abstract": "The lack of motility makes plants highly vulnerable to environmental anomalies such as periods of extreme high temperature known as heat waves. Plants can search for better habitats by exploiting seed mobility, which relies on completing the life cycle and producing seeds. Formation of reproductive organs and seed development requires the production of cells through cell division. The last stage of cell division, cytokinesis, encompasses many key cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell wall biosynthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signaling. While cytokinesis is highly sensitive to heat stress in plants adapted to temperate climates, cytokinesis is more resilient in species adapted to tropical zones. However, how heat stress affects cytokinesis and the mechanisms of cytokinetic robustness across different plant species remains unknown. This project aims to compare changes in cytokinetic components under heat stress in susceptible and hardy species to characterize differential responses of genetic circuits responsible for specific cellular events during cytokinesis. The long term goal is to harness this data for identifying the bottlenecks of cytokinetic robustness. The experimental approach here will be systematic analysis of publicly available data from single-cell and whole-organ omics data collected under control and high-temperature conditions including transcriptomics, translatomics, and proteomics. Predicting cytokinetic bottlenecks will inform future experimental design for their functional characterization leading to better understanding of cellular adaptation mechanisms to heat stress. This knowledge may provide insight into evolutionary strategies of plant adaptation to different climates and improve predictions for heat resiliency at the level of individual plants and populations.",

This framework seeks to illuminate the interplay between three-dimensional genomic architecture and gene expression, uncovering the physical principles underlying the emergence of cell-type-specific gene expression programs, despite the inherent stochasticity of gene regulation at the single-cell level.

However, LLMs lack the ability to directly analyze datasets, necessitating integration with bioinformatics tools to enable robust computational analysis. This project aims to develop MaiTool, a graphical interface that combines LLM capabilities with bioinformatics workflows for microbiome and ancient DNA research. MaiTool will enable users to explore publications, access public datasets via APIs, and perform dynamic analyses, integrating quality control measures to enhance reliability. Existing GPT systems (e.g., BioGPT, BioMedLM, and GeneGPT) will be evaluated and fine-tuned for microbiome applications. We will assess repositories such as HMP, IMG/M, and SRA for their suitability and develop APIs for seamless data access and integration. By addressing queries such as studies involving specific taxa, MaiTool will allow LLMs to retrieve literature while bioinformatics pipelines analyze and visualize dataset profiles. This approach aims to advance interdisciplinary research workflows and establish a new standard for AI-driven bioinformatics.",

Researchers often only analyze data they generate themselves—usually for just one strain under a limited number of conditions—because it is difficult to harmonize omics datasets collected with different technologies in different labs. Our NCEMS working group will synthesize bacterial gene expression data using machine learning to create a first-of-its-kind atlas of bacterial cell states. To manageably scale data collection and analysis, we will build from examining model Escherichia coli strains in lab conditions, to adding wild E. coli strains in natural environments such as the human gut, to including diverse bacterial species with additional cell states. We expect to identify distinct foci corresponding to bacterial growth states and lifestyles (e.g., replicating, starving, motile, biofilm, spore, viable but nonculturable) by mapping the organization and occupancy of cell state space with dimensional reduction approaches. We will examine to what extent the gene expression signatures of different cell states and the relationships among them are conserved during bacterial evolution. Finally, we will use this framework to create a classifier that predicts the cell state composition of a bacterial population from metatranscriptomic data. By following open-science practices, we will make our pipelines and datasets reusable and maintainable by the research community. Our project may reveal new bacterial cell states and ways that we can non-genetically reprogram bacteria to prevent them from adopting lifestyles that damage the environment and cause disease.",

In the cell, these proteins are preferentially engaged by chaperones and quality control proteins that refold or degrade them. Similarly, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) preferentially interact with specific partners that they require for folding and function. Such proteins must exhibit bias in the types of protein-protein interactions they form within the cell. We therefore hypothesize that the emergent scaling properties of protein interaction networks arise, in part, from the promiscuous interactions formed by unstable proteins and the obligate interactions formed by IDPs. To test this hypothesis, we will analyze existing large-scale interactome datasets to explore the context of unstable and disordered proteins within interaction networks. By extending this approach to evaluate how proteins with various conformational properties are distributed across several unicellular and multicellular networks, we aim to uncover generalizable insights into how protein biophysics shapes network architecture. Additionally, by mapping the centrality of proteins involved in various supramolecular organization regimes, we will identify topological niches associated with the occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation and quinary structure. Finally, to determine the extent to which these biases constrain network evolution, we will utilize genetic algorithms to explore how changes in the stability of the proteome restrict the topologies that are accessible through evolution. Together, these investigations will provide insights into the role of protein stability and binding efficiency in the evolution of PPI networks and how this relates to the molecular mechanisms of evolution.",

Despite their importance, we lack a comprehensive map of these cellular RNA-protein interaction networks at both the nano and micro scales. Years of efforts by researchers across the globe have yielded a large, but disjointed, collection of datasets that map different aspects of RNA-protein interactions. Currently, we lack tools to integrate these datasets, preventing their synthesis into a coherent and interpretable interaction map. Here, we propose to develop tools to combine disparate data types to build transcriptome-wide maps of mRNPs, and their higher-order interactions within cells. We will then apply these tools to gain insights into long-standing biological mysteries, including the impacts of synonymous mutations and cell-type specific effects of widely expressed RNAs.",

Despite evidence from individual studies, a comprehensive understanding of IDR-driven adaptations across diverse environments remains elusive. The deep sea, characterized by extreme and variable conditions such as temperature, pressure, and salinity, offers a unique opportunity to address this knowledge gap. Over the past decade, large-scale ocean sampling expeditions using shotgun metagenomics have revolutionized our understanding of marine biodiversity, providing access to the genetic diversity of organisms, from microbes to fish, thriving in these extreme habitats. These datasets offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore how IDRs have evolved as molecular sensors to support survival across varied environmental conditions. Here, we will, for the same time, use these metagenomic datasets to systematically characterize IDRs as environmental sensors. Our multidisciplinary team, with expertise in metagenomics, protein biophysics, cell biology, and deep learning, will integrate bioinformatics, simulations, machine learning, and theoretical approaches to uncover sequence-level and functional adaptations of IDRs across marine environments. The outcomes of this research will produce a comprehensive map of IDR adaptations in marine systems, revealing their emergent properties as molecular sensors and actuators.

However, these datasets remain fragmented, lacking integration into a unified framework to model and quantify DNA, RNA, and protein within the same cell. While previous efforts have created multimodal benchmark datasets, these often include diverse samples from multiple donors and heterogeneous cell types. In contrast, our project focuses on single model systems, such as commonly used cell lines, which already feature extensive single-cell, bulk sequencing, and imaging data. By eliminating donor and cell type variability, our approach enables robust analyses and precise alignment across modalities, including RNA, protein, and chromatin accessibility. This focus on homogenous cell types within a consistent biological context facilitates mechanistic studies of regulatory interactions and perturbation responses, minimizing confounding variability. We aim to develop multimodal frameworks for 7 cell lines and computational pipelines to analyze relationships across DNA, RNA, and protein levels. By incorporating additional multi-omics data, including bulk and single-cell perturbation datasets (e.g., loss-of-function screens and Perturb-seq), we will create a comprehensive benchmarking resource.

We propose a two-phase approach: First, we will reprocess tens of thousands of publicly available genomic datasets (including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and Ribo-seq) using repeat-aware analysis pipelines and new telomere-to-telomere and pangenome assemblies. Second, we will synthesize this reprocessed data to understand how TEs generate new transcription factor binding sites, cell-specific and species-specific enhancers, novel transcripts, and protein-coding sequences. The project combines multidisciplinary expertise from multiple labs and will leverage advanced computational approaches to uncover complex relationships between TEs and regulatory networks. Our investigation represents a quintessential mesoscale emergence phenomenon, bridging molecular-level TE insertions with emergent regulatory networks and phenotypic innovations.

Initially developed in the 2000s to interrogate purified proteins, by the late-2010s, methods became available to interrogate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) on the proteome-scale and in the cellular environment.5 This project seeks to standardize, combine, and integrate existing publicly available crosslinking datasets from PRIDE to make these data more re-usable and useful for integrative and hybrid modeling. We will also create a meta-dataset to catalogue PPIs in human and other model organisms. Because XL-MS encodes information about both protein identity and interacting residues, these findings can be cross-validated to structural predictions of protein complexes using AlphaFold3, thereby providing stronger evidence for their existence compared to huMAP3.0, which predicts protein complexes without structural evidence.
