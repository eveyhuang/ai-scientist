human_1,human,human,human,CYTOKINETIC BOTTLENECKS OF HEAT WAVES,"The lack of motility makes plants highly vulnerable to environmental anomalies such as periods of extreme high temperature known as heat waves. Plants can search for better habitats by exploiting seed mobility, which relies on completing the life cycle and producing seeds. Formation of reproductive organs and seed development requires the production of cells through cell division. The last stage of cell division, cytokinesis, encompasses many key cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell wall biosynthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signaling. While cytokinesis is highly sensitive to heat stress in plants adapted to temperate climates, cytokinesis is more resilient in species adapted to tropical zones. However, how heat stress affects cytokinesis and the mechanisms of cytokinetic robustness across different plant species remains unknown. This project aims to compare changes in cytokinetic components under heat stress in susceptible and hardy species to characterize differential responses of genetic circuits responsible for specific cellular events during cytokinesis. The long term goal is to harness this data for identifying the bottlenecks of cytokinetic robustness. The experimental approach here will be systematic analysis of publicly available data from single-cell and whole-organ omics data collected under control and high-temperature conditions including transcriptomics, translatomics, and proteomics. Predicting cytokinetic bottlenecks will inform future experimental design for their functional characterization leading to better understanding of cellular adaptation mechanisms to heat stress. This knowledge may provide insight into evolutionary strategies of plant adaptation to different climates and improve predictions for heat resiliency at the level of individual plants and populations.",Andrei Smertenko; Carolyn Rasmussen; Dawn Nagel; Georgia Drakakaki; Stephen Ficklin,"Introduction 4.1. Problem overview. 4.1.1. Cytokinesis is critical for plant life. The majority of planetary plant biomass derives from cytokinesis. Plant cytokinesis occurs via the formation of a specialized membrane compartment, the cell plate, between daughter cells. The cell plate gradually matures into a cell wall after cytokinesis is complete. One of the key processes accompanying this transition is replacing callose, the main polysaccharide in the cell plate lumen, with cellulose. A plant-specific polarized secretory module, the phragmoplast, is responsible for constructing the cell plate. The phragmoplast consists of microtubules and actin cytoskeleton, vesicles, and associated proteins. As the phragmoplast diameter is commonly smaller than the cell width, completing the cell plate construction requires phragmoplast expansion. The expansion is driven by microtubules and requires coordination between microtubule dynamics, membrane and cell-wall-component trafficking, exocytosis, vesicle fusion, and endocytosis. Phragmoplast expansion encompasses four steps: establishment of microtubule overlap, vesicle recruitment, vesicle fusion and remodeling, and microtubule depolymerization. Each step requires a dedicated genetic network comprising structural proteins, enzymes, and signaling components. 4.1.2. Cytokinesis is sensitive to heat stress. Exposing tobacco tissue culture cells to 38°C for 2 h causes cytokinetic arrest and elongation of phragmoplast microtubules while cells remain viable; subsequently, microtubule organization does not recover even by 2 hours at normal temperature, indicating that the arrest is long-term. In meiotic Arabidopsis cells treated at 36–38°C, chromosome segregation is disrupted and microtubule density in the phragmoplast is reduced. In the flowering sea grass Cymodocea nodosa, treatment at 38°C for 2 h depolymerizes some phragmoplast microtubules but does not block cytokinesis. The graded heat stress responses among species will allow us to identify both common and distinct resilience mechanisms of cytokinesis. 4.1.3. Outcomes of prior studies 4.1.3.1. Cytokinesis is differentially sensitive to heat stress within the plant lineage. Arabidopsis plants are killed at about 35°C whereas maize plants are killed by temperatures at least 10 degrees higher. Consequently, maize cytokinesis could be resilient to heat stress. We compared the impact of heat stress on cytokinesis in these species. On the basis of published data 38°C was used to induce stress. Exposure of 6-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings to 38°C for 1 hour caused cell plate tilting and disorganization, as indicated by the cytokinetic vesicle marker RABA2a. Cell plate assembly failed resulting in formation of cell wall stubs and phragmoplasts were aberrantly long. We examined microtubule stability in the elongated phragmoplasts using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and found very slow recovery of the fluorescent signal. As the signal recovery requires microtubule depolymerization, this outcome suggests that heat stress suppressed depolymerization of phragmoplast microtubules. Oppositely, in 3-week-old maize seedlings the phragmoplast morphology appeared unaltered and no cell wall stubs were detected even after exposure to 42°C or 45°C. Thus, cytokinesis is heat-resilient in maize. This outcome is consistent with the report that the 2021 heat wave caused yield losses to all dryland farming crops except maize. Therefore, comparing the impact of 38°C on cytokinetic components in Arabidopsis and tobacco with those in maize will likely inform on mechanisms of cytokinetic robustness. 4.1.3.2. Impact of heat stress on transcription and translation of cytokinetic genes. While analyzing the impact of heat stress on circadian clock-regulated genes, we discovered changes in both the abundance of mRNAs and in the ribosome-binding fraction encoding key cytokinetic genes. For example, the phragmoplast-localized kinesin HINKEL was reduced after heat treatment on both transcriptome and translatome levels. AIR9 transcripts were not significantly affected by heat treatment. Heat stress resulted in lower transcription and translation of multiple cytokinetic genes with the exception of the midzone localized formin homology protein AtFH8 whose translation was specifically upregulated. AtFH8 might contribute to the stabilization of microtubule plus-ends at the phragmoplast midzone. Up-regulation of this protein could be a mechanism to sustain phragmoplast organization under heat stress. Therefore, comparison of transcriptome and translatome data captures the complexity of cytokinetic gene regulation in responses to stresses. 4.1.4. Conceptual framework. According to the theory of biological robustness, genetic networks for individual traits contain specific robustness alleles instead of a master robustness allele acting across multiple networks. Consequently, known robustness alleles for other traits are unlikely to contribute to heat resiliency of cytokinesis. Instead, cytokinetic robustness must be achieved by temporally controlling and genetically buffering distinct cytokinetic processes in a modular fashion. When a genetic network experiences an interruption, both the central hubs and less connected nodes could either limit or maintain resiliency. Consequently, identifying cytokinetic bottlenecks requires generating cytokinetic protein networks and comparing their behaviour under normal and stress conditions. Construction of cytokinetic networks is hindered by limited information about their components. Despite genetic screens for cytokinetic mutants having already identified multiple players, many cytokinetic genes remain unidentified either due to genetic redundancy or lethality. Furthermore, despite biophysical modeling indicating that callose provides the spreading force for membrane remodeling during cell plate expansion, there are numerous knowledge gaps about other carbohydrates and corresponding enzymes during cytokinesis. 4.2. Goals. The long-term goal of our research is to determine the rules and limits of cytokinetic robustness under heat stress and harness this knowledge for improving plant resiliency. Although it has been shown that high temperatures perturb membrane assembly and cytoskeletal dynamics during cytokinesis the underlying molecular mechanisms of such changes remain unknown. The objective of this project is to exploit available data to predict bottlenecks of cytokinesis. A bottleneck is defined as a gene whose product becomes dysfunctional or less functional in response to heat stress. The rationale for this project is based on the following elements: heat stress induces transcriptional changes of genes encoding cytokinetic proteins; plants adapted to hotter environments likely evolved mechanisms to buffer the effects of heat stress on cell division; analysis of available data can inform on differences of cytokinetic responses in heat resilient and heat tolerant species. We plan to achieve the main objective through three specific aims below. 5. Proposed Activities. 5.1. Aim 1. Construct cytokinetic networks using single-cell omics data. Our knowledge about cytokinetic components is limited to several dozens of cytokinesis-defective mutants, a few protein-protein interaction maps, and information about mitotic transcripts. Many proteins required for cytokinesis remain unknown. This aim will take a holistic approach to identify the cytokinetic gene networks using single-cell transcriptomics data from plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, and Nicotiana tabacum to identify conserved cytokinetic transcripts as well as species-specific cytokinetic transcripts. Raw data will be reprocessed following a standardized pipeline for all omics datasets to allow for effective comparative analysis and interpretation of the data. For single-cell transcriptomics, the analysis for count normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering visualization, trajectory analysis, and differential gene expression analysis may vary depending on the lab. Therefore, data reprocessing will account for variation and enable statistically significant perturbations to be compared. Then the following pipeline will be used. First, a list of mitotic-related genes including paralogs will be compiled for Arabidopsis from published data. Second, a standardized pipeline such as an orthology inference method will identify orthologous genes from maize, sorghum, rice, and tobacco. Third, the single-cell transcriptome data will be either analyzed or reanalyzed to identify co-expressed transcripts. Fourth, transcripts that are only expressed in cells expressing known mitotic-specific transcripts will be selected as benchmark transcripts to identify coexpressing transcripts. Then, transcripts that appear in fewer than half of the datasets per organism will be more closely assessed for removal from the list. The expected outcome would be a table of Arabidopsis mitosis and cytokinesis proteins and their homologs in other plant species. 5.2. Aim 2. Compare cytokinetic responses to heat stress in heat susceptible and resilient species. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that cytokinesis is heat-sensitive in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana, and heat-tolerant in Zea mays. This aim will compare omics data of Zea mays and other heat-tolerant species with those of heat-sensitive species. As in Aim 1, the raw data will be reprocessed. Analysis will focus on identifying responses that are different between tolerant and susceptible species for each type of omics analyses. We will also identify the transcription factors and cis-regulatory components of these genes that act specifically in heat stress response using available datasets. Completing this aim will inform on which pathways are affected by heat stress in heat tolerant and susceptible species. 5.3. Aim 3. Predict cytokinetic bottlenecks through integration of available datasets. The activities in this aim will construct multi-layered cytokinetic-specific networks and compare their changes under heat stress conditions in susceptible and tolerant species. The first step will be single-layer analysis within a single type of omics data. Analyses for each layer will include differential analysis, correlation network analysis, time series clustering, and association networks. The second stage will be construction of a multiplex network that combines single-layer networks from different omics datasets into a multilayer model. Connections, or edges, between the layers indicate inter-layer relationships. Analysis of networks is expected to generate candidate molecular features with potential influence on differences in cytokinetic responses. These comparisons are predicted to identify cytokinetic bottlenecks under heat stress. We will write a manuscript on this topic and submit it towards the end of year 2. 5.4. Potential problems could arise from the datasets being generated using plants grown under different conditions as well as due to the differences in how the normalization and further analysis were performed. To address this problem we will reanalyze all datasets as outlined in Specific Aim 1, and also including a large number of datasets will help to average the noise caused by variable growth conditions. 6. Outcomes. We anticipate this project will predict cytokinetic bottlenecks under heat stress. This information will be used to formulate the theory of cytokinetic responses to heat stress. The theory will aim to answer the following questions. Which changes to cytokinetic processes in response to heat stress measured either at the transcript or the protein level are common to all species or species-specific? Are there specific subsets of cytokinesis genes or paralogs that have a differential response to heat stress? Do plants eliminate proteins or transcripts or stabilize them to adapt to heat stress? Would these changes promote or block cytokinesis? We will publish this theory as a review article. The theory will inform on the experiments that will lead to the identification of novel genetic, biochemical, and cellular markers of plant heat stress response. Such markers would enable predicting the performance of individual species and stability of entire ecosystems under elevated temperatures, identifying resilient genotypes among the available germplasm for urban ecosystems and afforestation projects, breeding crops with higher yield in hotter environments, developing new approaches for engineering heat-resilient landscaping plant species to contribute to sustainable habitats for humans and animals. 7. Rationale for a working group approach. Our team possesses expertise in cell biology of plant cytokinesis, membrane trafficking, heat stress impact on plant physiology, and protein biochemistry. We collectively have a deep mechanistic understanding of cytokinesis. Further, we collected preliminary data showing that heat stress does not break cytokinetic processes in susceptible plant species, but prevents cytokinetic progression through the arrest of cellular dynamics. The next logical step is to identify cytokinetic pathways affected by the heat stress, and compare them in tolerant and susceptible species using a bioinformatics approach. We want to team up with a synthesis center for the next important stage in understanding the impact of heat stress on cytokinesis. 8. Rationale for support. We hope to gain access to professional expertise in bioinformatics and complex data analysis. Publicly available single-cell and whole-tissue heat stress omics data offers rich material for predicting cytokinetic bottlenecks. Collaboration will lower the barriers of analyzing publicly available omics data for the investigators. Our cell biological data suggests that there will be differentially regulated cytokinetic pathways in heat tolerant and susceptible organisms and we can predict them using bioinformatics analyses. There is currently no alternative funding mechanism to support the transition from an initial concept to an experimental analysis. This project will contribute to developing the theory of cytokinetic robustness and help us to design experiments to test it. 9. Requested resources. To successfully perform the work described in the aims above, a staff scientist with bioinformatics expertise is requested for 4 months per year and an assistant staff scientist for 6 months per year for 2 years. Computational resources for storage and data processing are also needed to successfully implement and achieve the above aims. To accommodate the download and storage of the publicly available datasets listed in the data sources table and support the analyses we estimate and are requesting 50 terabytes of storage and 25,000 CPU hours.

human_2,human,human,human,Elucidating genome structure-function relationships in human brain cells,"Single-cell analysis has profoundly enhanced our understanding of brain tissue by facilitating the examination of gene expression and epigenetic features. However, investigating these modalities independently offers a fragmented view of gene regulation and its relationship to transcriptional activity. To overcome this limitation, we propose developing a multimodal generative AI model that integrates single-cell genomics datasets. This framework seeks to illuminate the interplay between three-dimensional genomic architecture and gene expression, uncovering the physical principles underlying the emergence of cell-type-specific gene expression programs, despite the inherent stochasticity of gene regulation at the single-cell level. Applied to datasets from Alzheimer's patients, this approach has the potential to identify epigenetic drivers of disease progression, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of neurodegenerative processes.",Bin Zhang; Longzhi Tan; Tamar Schlick; Dave Thirumalai; Justin Whalley,"Introduction and Goals The human brain is a highly complex biological system that contains a wide array of distinct cell types, each characterized by specific functions and properties. Understanding this intricate neural architecture requires an investigation into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the brain's cellular diversity, development, and function. A key aspect of this research is the classification of all cell types and the elucidation of their origins from a shared genetic framework. All brain cells share the same genome, yet their identities and functions are shaped by their epigenomes, which consist of covalent modifications to histones and DNA. Chromatin, the structure formed by DNA wrapping around histone proteins, regulates gene expression in eukaryotic cells through a complex network of chemical modifications. These modifications determine the transcriptional activity of the genome within each cell, thus defining their distinct characteristics and roles. To fully characterize a cell, it is essential to identify specific chemical modifications in DNA regions, assess DNA accessibility, analyze chromatin spatial organization, and measure RNA transcription. Single-cell analysis provides a powerful framework for uncovering details and variability often obscured in population-averaged studies. By profiling RNA expression, chromatin accessibility, chromatin organization, and DNA methylation, such analyses have advanced our understanding of the cellular diversity within human brain tissue, shedding light on the intricate epigenetic elements that may constitute regulatory networks. Nonetheless, examining individual modalities at the single-cell level offers an incomplete perspective on the complexity of gene regulatory networks and is insufficient for inferring causal relationships between these networks and gene expression. We propose methodologies to integrate single-cell genomics data for constructing multimodal datasets. With these datasets, we will develop a multimodal generative AI model to capture the distribution across three genomic domains: chromatin accessibility, three-dimensional chromatin organization, and gene expression. This model will define genomic states, offering molecular insights into neuron characteristics, and facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationships within the genome. Further applying the model to single-cell data collected from Alzheimer’s patients will provide insight into molecular determinants that drive disease progression. Proposed Activities Develop a multimodal model for human brain cells. A primary objective of the working group is to develop a multimodal model that integrates chromatin accessibility and three-dimensional chromatin organization with gene expression. This initiative is inspired by recent advances in deep learning techniques, particularly in AI models capable of synthesizing text and image data to provide comprehensive contextual insights. These models have shown considerable effectiveness across various domains, including multimodal data analysis and predictive modeling. The development of this model will enhance the understanding of chromatin organization’s functional role in regulating gene expression under normal conditions and its potential contribution to aberrant gene expression during disease progression. Model Design The proposed model is based on the transformer architecture linking DNA sequences and chromatin accessibility to gene expression. The design builds upon the framework of EPCOT introduced by Zhang et al., which generates transferable embeddings for DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility data that can be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks. Notably, this framework demonstrated that these embeddings enable reliable predictions of gene expression from bulk RNA-seq data. Our approach introduces two key advances: a focus on single-cell RNA-seq prediction and the incorporation of structural information from single-cell Hi-C data to improve predictive accuracy. The three-dimensional chromatin organization captured by single-cell Hi-C is represented as a contact matrix and processed using the Vision Transformer architecture, originally designed for image data but successfully applied to Hi-C data. The Vision Transformer encoder transforms the three-dimensional chromatin data into numerical embeddings, which are integrated into the expression prediction module through cross-attention layers. Specifically, the three-dimensional organization is represented by a contact matrix centered on the target gene. This matrix encapsulates the structural context surrounding the gene, including chromatin loops, topologically associating domains, and compartments. The spatial range of the proposed model substantially exceeds that of existing approaches, enabling it to capture a diverse array of gene regulatory mechanisms. Model Parameterization and Validation Parameterizing this model requires co-assay data obtained from experiments that concurrently measure chromatin organization and gene expression. Due to limited availability of such datasets, we propose adopting a pretraining and fine-tuning approach to enhance model transferability. The encoder for single-cell Hi-C will be pretrained using data sources that provide chromatin organization and gene expression information at single-cell resolution for various human brain tissues. These datasets will be consolidated into a consensus list of cell types, facilitating the learning of cell-type-specific chromatin organization features that underpin the corresponding gene expression programs. Beyond generating embeddings for gene expression prediction, the proposed model, termed single-cell chromatin organization embedding (scCOE), is expected to serve as a robust tool for extracting interpretable features of chromatin organization. The pretraining strategy is inspired by the CLIP framework developed by OpenAI that achieves co-embedding of text and image data, thereby linking two distinct modalities. Specifically, we will utilize contrastive learning to align embeddings for chromatin organization with embeddings for gene expression derived from scGPT. scGPT, a large language model trained on single-cell RNA-seq data from millions of cells, has demonstrated significant utility in tasks including cell type annotation, perturbation response prediction, and gene network inference. By aligning chromatin organization embeddings with those from scGPT, our approach aims to uncover structurally relevant features linked to gene function. During this phase, gene expression embeddings will be precomputed and held constant, while only the parameters of the vision transformer encoding chromatin organization will be optimized. A key advantage of using contrastive learning lies in its ability to optimize the model using single-cell data derived from separate experiments. Although chromatin organization and gene expression are not measured in the same cells, categorization into a consensus set of cell types allows optimization. Within this framework, embeddings are optimized so that chromatin organization and gene expression from the same cell type share higher similarity than those from different cell types. Following pretraining, the complete model, named single-cell gene expression prediction (scGEP), will be fine-tuned using additional data. Co-assay data for human brain cells are unavailable; nevertheless, assuming that different cell types share similar gene regulatory mechanisms, we anticipate that the model fine-tuned with available cell types will be transferable to brain cells. Chromatin accessibility will be assessed at the bulk level via ATAC-seq. The chromatin organization and DNA sequence plus ATAC-seq encoders will be adopted from the pretrained EPCOT model, with their parameters frozen. Training will focus on predicting single-cell gene expression based on single-cell chromatin organization contextualized by bulk chromatin accessibility. Tensor Decomposition After preparing the data for the AI model, we can enhance analysis by performing tensor decomposition, a technique successfully applied in projects like the COVID-19 Multi-Omics Blood Atlas and Genomic Advances in Sepsis. This supplementary analysis offers two key benefits: first, dimensionality reduction and outlier detection; second, handling missing data through imputation. By decomposing multimodal data into components, we can reduce its dimensionality and identify or remove outliers that could adversely affect analysis. The tensor decomposition method can accommodate missing data, making it ideal for samples lacking certain modalities. By reconstructing data from decomposed tensors, we can impute missing values, expanding and enriching the dataset for further analysis. Potential Caveats Data will be divided into training, validation, and testing subsets to assess model performance. Limited co-assay data may impact model transferability. If performance is unsatisfactory, additional training will be carried out using co-assay data from mouse cells, which, while not as deep as human datasets, may still serve for pretraining. Hypothesis Variation in genome organization drives gene expression changes Despite extensive research, the mechanisms governing gene expression remain poorly understood. Prior studies have yielded conflicting conclusions regarding chromatin organization’s significance in gene regulation, often due to limited gene coverage or reliance on population-averaged data. The availability of genome-wide datasets encompassing both expression and three-dimensional organization from the same cell provides an opportunity for systematic exploration of chromatin’s role in gene regulation. The computational tool scCOE offers a framework to associate changes in chromatin organization with variations in gene expression. Traditional analyses emphasize structural motifs such as loops, domains, and compartments, but their functional relevance remains uncertain. scCOE generates embeddings aligned with gene expression, capturing functionally significant structural characteristics. Investigating the variation of these embeddings across brain cell types can provide insight into how chromatin organization contributes to neuronal diversity from the same DNA sequence. This approach also enables examination of how heterogeneity in gene expression within a cell type correlates with variations in chromatin architecture. While scCOE offers qualitative insights into chromatin organization’s influence, scGEP quantitatively assesses whether chromatin organization suffices for accurate expression prediction. The multimodal model’s performance will be compared to models using only DNA sequence, chromatin accessibility, or chromatin organization. We hypothesize that a model based solely on DNA sequence will perform moderately well but lack precision, while adding chromatin organization as a contextual feature will substantially improve predictions of cell type-specific expression patterns. Hypothesis Functionally relevant embedding of genome organization offers insight into Alzheimer’s disease Genome organization is hierarchical, encoding vast amounts of information. Interpreting changes within this organization, particularly between normal and diseased cells, poses challenges. Profiling the chromatin conformation of Alzheimer’s disease patients and controls has revealed variability, but identifying functionally relevant variations remains difficult. To address this, we propose two complementary analyses to interrogate genome organization alterations associated with disease. We will first use scCOE to derive embeddings of three-dimensional chromatin organization at the single-cell level. These embeddings, optimized for predicting gene expression, are designed to capture structural features linked to regulatory mechanisms. Dimensionality reduction visualization will be used to compare cells from Alzheimer’s patients and controls. Observing significant structural differences may reveal disease-relevant architectural changes. Downstream modeling will aim to uncover molecular determinants—potentially epigenetic or nucleosome-related—that underlie structural disruptions. Structural analysis of folding mechanisms involving looping motifs and nucleosome interactions can elucidate biophysical rules that dictate genome folding and its relationship with gene expression. Next, scGEP will be used to predict gene expression changes to directly compare patients and controls. Elevated expression of specific genes in microglia has been implicated in pathology. By using scGEP to predict alterations in gene expression, we aim to determine whether such changes result from modifications in chromatin organization. Together, these approaches may provide mechanistic insight into causal relationships between chromatin architecture and expression, identifying potential therapeutic strategies to restore normal gene regulation. Outcomes Technological advancement Two computational tools, scCOE and scGEP, will be produced. scCOE will facilitate analysis and interpretation of single-cell genome organization data as such data become increasingly available. scGEP will enable integration of single-cell multimodal data to better define cell types and characterize cellular diversity. Scientific advancement The proposed research will transform understanding of brain function, potentially identifying molecular markers for diseases such as Alzheimer’s. It will provide insight into the connection between DNA sequence, three-dimensional genome architecture, and gene expression, addressing fundamental questions regarding genome organization’s role in regulation. Publications Two manuscripts are expected, one focusing on technological innovation in multimodal modeling of gene regulatory mechanisms and another focusing on biological insights into genome organization in normal brain and diseased cells. Rationale for a working group approach The proposed approach is interdisciplinary, requiring bioinformatics expertise to organize genomics datasets, deep learning skills to build mechanistic models, and understanding of brain biology to interpret AI findings. The project’s complexity necessitates collaboration across multiple research groups. Rationale for NCEMS support The NCEMS team will play a key role in collecting single-cell genomics data and integrating assays into a unified database. The center’s computational resources will also facilitate deep learning model training. Requested resources Model training will require substantial GPU and CPU computing resources and data storage capacity. We request partial support of a staff scientist with expertise in single-cell genomics and deep learning.",Accepted,7.0

These models excel at understanding complex queries, enabling intelligent data retrieval tailored to project-specific needs. For instance, they can extract insights from publications, summarize methodologies, and, in the area of microbiome research, say, identify relevant datasets in repositories like MGnify and MG-RAST. However, the direct analysis of datasets remains beyond the core capabilities of such systems. Integrating LLMs with traditional bioinformatics tools offers a promising solution, bridging the gap between natural language understanding and robust computational analysis. This integration could enable on-the-fly analyses of microbiome data while incorporating essential components like quality control to flag potential issues with datasets early in the pipeline. By combining LLMs’ contextual understanding with the computational power of bioinformatics tools, researchers could streamline workflows, ensuring efficient access to both published findings and actionable data.

Such a system will empower researchers to make informed decisions efficiently, fostering innovation and collaboration in microbiome research and beyond. While the primary focus is on microbiome science, we also plan to explore extensions to computational challenges in analyzing ancient DNA sequences, including the microbiome analysis of ancient DNA samples. Proposed Activities: Data Collection, Curation, and Analysis Framework We propose to evaluate various GPT systems (BioGPT, BioMedLM and GeneGPT) to determine their effectiveness in assisting researchers with engaging and extracting insights from the scientific literature. Building on this foundation, we will identify 5–10 key use cases where the integration of bioinformatics tools—focused on quality assurance, data visualization, and lightweight computational analysis—can enhance the relevance and utility of the results. This approach aims to create a synergistic system that combines the contextual understanding of GPT models with the analytical power of bioinformatics to deliver targeted, actionable insights for microbiome research. In addition to evaluating existing GPT systems for their applicability in microbiome research, we will explore the feasibility of enhancing their performance through two approaches: either setting up our own large language model (LLM) tailored to specific microbiome research needs or fine-tuning existing open-source models. This exploration will help determine the optimal balance between leveraging pre-trained models and creating customized solutions to support advanced analysis and research workflows. In microbiome research, several public repositories provide access to microbiome data. Key repositories include MGnify, MG-RAST, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), the Microbiome Atlas of Mothers and Infants (MAMI), the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes system (IMG/M) and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) from NCBI (further please see Data Sources Table), which is the most comprehensive resource for raw sequencing data. We will evaluate each of these repositories to assess their suitability as sources of analysis results, focusing on their data accessibility, quality, and relevance to specific research needs. Additionally, we plan to develop software tools that leverage the APIs provided by these repositories to facilitate seamless access, integration, and utilization of their datasets within our system. This will enable efficient retrieval and analysis of microbiome data, supporting advanced research workflows. As an example, consider a user interested in determining whether there are studies that include a specific microbiome species of interest, such as the keystone gut species Christensenella minuta or oral species Methanobrevibacter oralis. Using the proposed system, a GPT model would first identify relevant publications that mention this species, extracting key information such as study descriptions, methodologies, and findings and data accessions from the literature. Simultaneously, using the reported accessions, a bioinformatics pipeline could access taxonomic profiles for the associated studies by accessing public microbiome datasets (along with metadata) through APIs. The pipeline may perform additional analyses, such as generating visualizations or conducting statistical analyses to explore patterns and relationships involving C. minuta. In addition, the GPT can provide a pipeline that the user can run themselves. Preliminary Data, Tools and Analytical Approaches We will conduct a systematic investigation of several GPT models, including BioGPT, BioMedLM, and GeneGPT, to evaluate their suitability for applications in microbiome analysis. For each model, we will assess its capabilities and explore the potential for fine-tuning to enhance support for data analysis tasks. Simultaneously, we will examine key microbiome data resources, including MG-RAST, HMP, IMG/M, MAMI, and datasets hosted at NCBI. This evaluation will focus on methods for extracting data, identifying analyses that can be performed dynamically, and establishing effective communication with the APIs provided by each resource. A third focus of our activities will be determining the best approach for implementing the interactive exploration tool MaiTool. MaiTool will serve as the primary interface for users, connecting seamlessly to an API for tasks such as LLM usage, data retrieval, and lightweight microbiome analysis. We intend to develop a standalone application using Java, JavaFX and Gluon, which would provide a highly responsive and feature-rich user experience, running on all platforms. The development of MaiTool will include a dedicated phase for comprehensive testing and usability studies to ensure the system meets the needs of researchers effectively.

Lightweight Bioinformatics Analysis Framework: We will create a bioinformatics framework to perform lightweight analyses on data obtained through the API, ensuring efficient and accessible computational workflows. (While a GPT may provide the description of a pipeline, the user will have to run it themselves, if they are interested in starting from scratch or raw data .) 4. Integrated AI-Bioinformatics System: A GPT system will be integrated with the developed tools to enable interactive access and analysis of microbiome data, bridging AI capabilities with bioinformatics functionality. 5. MaiTool Software for Analysis: We will develop a user-friendly software tool called MaiTool, designed to support both microbiome and ancient DNA analysis. MaiTool will provide an interactive interface for researchers, connecting seamlessly to APIs and integrating some analysis capabilities. 6.

In addition, staff support will be vital for setting up computational workflows and implementing a REST API, ensuring seamless integration between components and efficient operation of the system. To foster innovation and collaboration, the project will also require support for short-term visitations between the labs of Working Group members. These visits will facilitate brainstorming, knowledge exchange, and the development of strategies to address the project’s interdisciplinary challenges. Requested resources The project requires 10–20 TB of storage for the enhancement and optimization of LLMs. Computational resources include 200–500 CPU cores and 10–30 GPUs, each with at least 100 GB of memory, to facilitate model development and optimization. RAM demands may increase up to 1–3 TB when models are combined. This will require approximately 200,000 CPU hours and 25000 GPU hours.

human_4,human,human,human,Synthesizing gene expression data to create an atlas of bacterial cell states,"Bacterial cells have evolved to adapt their molecular composition to maximize growth and survival. Our current knowledge of bacterial cell states is fragmented. Researchers often only analyze data they generate themselves—usually for just one strain under a limited number of conditions—because it is difficult to harmonize omics datasets collected with different technologies in different labs. Our NCEMS working group will synthesize bacterial gene expression data using machine learning to create a first-of-its-kind atlas of bacterial cell states. To manageably scale data collection and analysis, we will build from examining model Escherichia coli strains in lab conditions, to adding wild E. coli strains in natural environments such as the human gut, to including diverse bacterial species with additional cell states. We expect to identify distinct foci corresponding to bacterial growth states and lifestyles (e.g., replicating, starving, motile, biofilm, spore, viable but nonculturable) by mapping the organization and occupancy of cell state space with dimensional reduction approaches. We will examine to what extent the gene expression signatures of different cell states and the relationships among them are conserved during bacterial evolution. Finally, we will use this framework to create a classifier that predicts the cell state composition of a bacterial population from metatranscriptomic data. By following open-science practices, we will make our pipelines and datasets reusable and maintainable by the research community. Our project may reveal new bacterial cell states and ways that we can non-genetically reprogram bacteria to prevent them from adopting lifestyles that damage the environment and cause disease.",Jeffrey Barrick; Jeremy Schmit,"Introduction and Goals Bacterial cells modulate gene expression to adapt their physiology to changes in their environment, for example transitioning from actively replicating to quiescent states in response to nutrient exhaustion. Much like cells within multicellular organisms, clonal bacterial populations can diversify and differentiate into cell types with distinct phenotypes such as biofilm or planktonic growth, motile or sessile forms, and specialized nitrogen-fixing cells. However, it remains unclear to what extent bacterial cells have evolved to occupy a small number of discrete gene expression states that they abruptly transition between, or if they exist along a continuum of states that gradually shift in composition. Less is known about how these gene expression states are related and conserved across species during evolution, and it is possible that some bacterial cell states remain undiscovered because existing data are limited to specific laboratory conditions and strains. The goal of this project is to test key hypotheses about the organization of bacterial gene expression space and to synthesize this information into a unified atlas of bacterial cell states. Specifically, we aim to determine whether bacterial cells occupy and transition between a limited number of distinct states, whether key principles such as the growth–quiescence axis are conserved across species, whether specialized lifestyles such as biofilm formation evolved from subfunctionalization of core states, and whether a comprehensive atlas of these states can enable prediction of population composition from transcriptomic data. We will synthesize existing bacterial gene expression datasets collected using microarray and RNA-seq technologies, beginning with model Escherichia coli strains, then expanding to wild isolates and ultimately to diverse bacterial species, to examine the organization and occupancy of bacterial gene expression state space. Existing Datasets Thousands of bacterial gene expression datasets have been generated and deposited in databases such as OKgeneExpDB, E. coli Expression 2, Ecomics, PRECISE, COLUMBOS, and iModulonDB. These repositories encompass tens of thousands of gene expression profiles representing variations in environmental conditions, genetic backgrounds, and experimental perturbations. Although many datasets include curated metadata and quality control, most existing resources are not fully open or community-maintained, limiting reuse and integration. Prior Analyses Machine learning approaches have previously been applied to predict bacterial growth rates and conditions from gene expression profiles and to identify modules of co-regulated genes. However, differences in technologies, protocols, and experimental designs introduce systematic variation that can confound these analyses. Robust harmonization of datasets and advanced quality control are necessary to enable meaningful synthesis and discovery. Project Significance Previous studies have not focused on systematically identifying bacterial cell states, which we define as distinct growth or lifestyle conditions characterized by coordinated shifts in gene expression across many genes. For example, aerobic planktonic growth represents one state, distinct from anaerobic growth, starvation, or biofilm formation. While single-cell RNA-seq could eventually define these states with precision, technical challenges currently limit its applicability to bacteria. Instead, we will integrate existing bulk gene expression datasets, reasoning that many of them capture nearly pure cell states or mixtures of a few dominant ones. Using dimensional reduction and clustering methods, we aim to infer an atlas of bacterial cell states and the relationships among them. Proposed Activities Develop the open-source inGEST pipeline for harmonizing bacterial gene expression datasets Our analysis requires assembling and processing large numbers of high-quality gene expression datasets. We will process tens of thousands of RNA-seq and microarray datasets from public repositories in a uniform way, applying standardized filtering and normalization while identifying and correcting for technical variation. The Integrative Gene Expression Synthesis Tool (InGEST) will include conventional preprocessing steps for both microarray and RNA-seq data as well as advanced quality control functions that detect anomalies such as DNA contamination or inconsistent replicates. Using the scale of the aggregated data, we will train algorithms to identify and adjust for systematic biases, such as those introduced by differing read lengths or protocols. InGEST will be released as an open, community-maintainable software package with full documentation, tutorials, and containerized deployment options to ensure accessibility and long-term sustainability. Apply dimensional reduction methods to create the Atlas of Bacterial Cell States To delineate distinct cell states and understand their relationships, we will apply unsupervised learning and dimensional reduction techniques commonly used in eukaryotic single-cell RNA-seq analysis. These approaches can reveal structure in high-dimensional data and help identify clusters corresponding to biological states. Our initial focus will be on curated Escherichia coli datasets, where we expect to identify primary attractors corresponding to exponential growth and stationary phase, forming a foundational growth–quiescence axis. Additional variation will likely correspond to sub-states such as stress responses or biofilm-associated growth. As InGEST matures, we will extend the analysis to non-laboratory E. coli strains and to natural environments such as the gut, identifying subfunctionalized states that build on the conserved axes. To account for variation in gene content between strains, we will use ortholog mapping tools such as Orthofinder to establish a consistent feature space across datasets. Finally, we will expand the analysis to include more than twenty bacterial species with sufficient datasets, encompassing model organisms and pathogens that exhibit additional states such as sporulation or quorum sensing. This broader atlas will allow us to identify conserved and specialized expression patterns and explore evolutionary relationships among cell states. Create a classifier that predicts the distribution of cell states in bacterial populations Using the atlas as a foundation, we will train classifiers to estimate the proportions of cells occupying different states within bulk transcriptomic or metatranscriptomic samples. Initially, we will train and validate these models on synthetic mixtures generated from pure-state datasets and later test them on available single-cell bacterial transcriptomes. Ultimately, we will apply these classifiers to environmental and host-associated microbial communities to predict functional composition and state distribution, providing a new lens for interpreting community-level gene expression. Outcomes This project will generate conceptual, methodological, and practical outcomes. Scientifically, it will yield the first comprehensive Atlas of Bacterial Cell States, revealing how gene expression landscapes are structured and conserved across species and environments. Methodologically, it will produce three key open-source products: the InGEST pipeline for harmonizing bacterial gene expression data, the Atlas of Bacterial Cell States as a community resource with visualization tools, and the Bacterial Cell Population Classifier that predicts cell state composition from expression data. Collectively, these resources will enable new analyses of bacterial physiology, evolution, and ecology. By integrating and harmonizing unprecedented amounts of data, we expect to uncover organizing principles of bacterial behavior and potentially identify novel cell states. Future work can extend this framework to other microbial domains and data types, including proteomics and metabolomics, enabling multi-omics integration of microbial states. Rationale for NCEMS support This project exemplifies mesoscale data synthesis: it leverages machine learning to integrate and analyze large volumes of bacterial gene expression data. Achieving this requires reproducible, scalable pipelines and community infrastructure that individual groups cannot maintain alone. NCEMS support is essential for implementing best practices in data management and sustainability, ensuring that the resulting resources are open, reusable, and extensible. In addition, NCEMS computational expertise will help in developing and applying advanced analytical methods for visualizing and quantifying relationships between bacterial cell states. Requested resources The primary computational demands involve downloading, processing, and analyzing thousands of RNA-seq datasets. Each dataset ranges from a few hundred megabytes to several gigabytes and can be processed within minutes on modern CPUs. Microarray data require negligible storage and compute time. Dimensional reduction and machine learning analyses can initially be run on modest hardware but may benefit from scalable computing for cross-species analyses. The final resource will consist of metadata, gene expression matrices, and annotated reference genomes, small enough to be hosted publicly and versioned for community access. Proposed Timeline The project will span two years. In the first year, we will focus on Escherichia coli, developing and validating the InGEST pipeline, harmonizing thousands of datasets, and identifying major cell states and marker genes. The second year will expand to additional bacterial species, refine the atlas to include conserved and specialized states, and develop the classifier for predicting state composition in mixed samples. Publications describing both the pipeline and the atlas will disseminate the findings and ensure long-term visibility and reuse.",Accepted,1.0
human_5,human,human,human,Energetic Origins of Connectivity within Protein Interaction Networks,"At least 10% of cellular proteins are intrinsically unstable and fold with marginal efficiency. In the cell, these proteins are preferentially engaged by chaperones and quality control proteins that refold or degrade them. Similarly, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) preferentially interact with specific partners that they require for folding and function. Such proteins must exhibit bias in the types of protein-protein interactions they form within the cell. We therefore hypothesize that the emergent scaling properties of protein interaction networks arise, in part, from the promiscuous interactions formed by unstable proteins and the obligate interactions formed by IDPs. To test this hypothesis, we will analyze existing large-scale interactome datasets to explore the context of unstable and disordered proteins within interaction networks. By extending this approach to evaluate how proteins with various conformational properties are distributed across several unicellular and multicellular networks, we aim to uncover generalizable insights into how protein biophysics shapes network architecture. Additionally, by mapping the centrality of proteins involved in various supramolecular organization regimes, we will identify topological niches associated with the occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation and quinary structure. Finally, to determine the extent to which these biases constrain network evolution, we will utilize genetic algorithms to explore how changes in the stability of the proteome restrict the topologies that are accessible through evolution. Together, these investigations will provide insights into the role of protein stability and binding efficiency in the evolution of PPI networks and how this relates to the molecular mechanisms of evolution.",Jonathan Schlebach; Shahid Mukhtar; Adrian Serohijos,"Introduction and Goals Over the past 20 years, emergent evidence has suggested that the architecture, scaling, and topologies of protein-protein interaction networks are similar across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. One apparent property of these networks is a scale-free topology in which interactions among proteins follow a power law distribution. While true scaling may be obscured by experimental biases, it is clear that most proteins form only a few discrete interactions, whereas a small number of hub proteins engage in numerous promiscuous interactions. It has been proposed that selection pressures have refined resilient network topologies in which key metabolic pivots can be regulated through a handful of connecting nodes. To ensure robustness, these high-degree hubs often have functionally redundant paralogs that minimize the fitness impact of deleterious mutations. In biological systems, “party hubs” are large proteins that form continuous interactions within functional complexes and exhibit co-expression, while “date hubs” are smaller proteins that form transient interactions with different partners and bridge network modules. Intrinsically disordered regions are a common feature of eukaryotic hub proteins, and disordered proteins in both hub types can introduce new specificities that differentiate single- and multiple-interface hubs. The position of a node within a network strongly influences its function. This can be described by its betweenness centrality, which measures how often a node lies on the shortest paths between pairs of other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act as bottlenecks and need not have high degree. Centrality descriptors can generally be categorized into neighborhood-based, path-based, and iterative refinement-based types. The magnitude of connections ultimately depends on the number of complexes a protein forms, which is determined by its biophysical properties and cellular abundance. Integrating multiscale biophysical and cellular network descriptors may reveal how intrinsic protein properties give rise to the topology of interaction networks and their biological roles. Numerous interactome datasets are available for constructing such networks, including for yeast and higher organisms like Arabidopsis and humans. These data have already provided insight into how pathogens target hubs and bottlenecks. Despite this progress, it remains unclear how cells achieve and maintain preferred network architectures given that their nodes—proteins—continuously evolve new interactions. While the evolutionary dynamics of interaction networks are poorly understood, much is known about evolutionary constraints on protein structure and function. Most mutations destabilize protein structure and reduce stability, meaning individual proteins can only tolerate certain combinations of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations before selection removes them. Based on this, we propose to develop a physical framework that describes how the properties of protein interaction networks emerge from the physical properties of their constituent proteins. For example, increases in abundance could compensate for low stability or weak binding, while weakened binding may promote promiscuous interactions. Unstable proteins might also form new chaperone interactions that facilitate transitions between clusters. Purifying selection could be weaker for low-degree or redundant high-degree proteins. We suspect that networks contain niches capable of accommodating variations in protein stability in ways that preserve overall topology. Such models could clarify how changes in protein stability, binding, and abundance contribute to network robustness. Our investigations will address how modular protein clusters maintain connectivity despite genetic drift, whether chaperone hubs act as anchors for topology, whether unstable clients engaging multiple chaperones move between clusters, and whether intrinsically disordered proteins become anchored within specific modules. We will repurpose interactome data to model networks across organisms and evaluate the topological context of proteins with divergent biophysical properties to reveal how protein physics gives rise to biological network organization. Goal Determine how protein stability biases interaction networks. Over time, most proteins traverse low-stability regimes that predispose them to chaperone binding. Shared chaperone hubs can create indirect proteostatic couplings that affect solubility and function. However, the influence of these client-chaperone interactions on network topology is unclear. We hypothesize that unstable proteins exhibit enhanced connectivity due to their association with the proteostasis network. To test this, we will construct a high-resolution yeast network using quality interactome data and combine it with computational protein stability estimates to assess the connectivity of unstable proteins. These analyses will be validated using proteolysis-based stability data, proteomic half-life measurements, and abundance data. Finally, we will repeat these analyses in organelle-specific subnetworks to test whether such patterns differ by compartment. Goal Survey interactions formed by unstable proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins within divergent networks. Higher organisms have evolved complex proteostasis networks that support structurally diverse proteomes and increase overall buffering capacity. It is unknown whether changes in proteostasis composition alter the interactions of unstable or disordered proteins or whether these proteins remain bound to specific chaperones across long evolutionary timescales. We hypothesize that unstable proteins form promiscuous chaperone interactions and more interactions overall than disordered proteins. To test this, we will extend the mapping approach to multiple organisms, characterize the topological positions of unstable and disordered proteins, and compare chaperone associations among homologous clients across species. By comparing metrics across stability and disorder classes, we will determine whether unstable proteins and their ancestors show preferential attachment to chaperone hubs that maintains their positions and preserves network scaling. Goal Determine how marginally stable and unstable proteins constrain network topology. Many proteins develop a dependence on specific chaperones as part of their assembly pathways. We hypothesize that persistent chaperone interactions restrain the topology of interaction networks. To test this, we will use genetic algorithms to simulate evolutionary trajectories of networks that integrate stability, binding efficiency, and abundance with tunable constraints on chaperone hub number and interaction persistence. These simulations will reveal whether degeneracy among client-chaperone interactions emerges across evolutionary timescales and how proteostasis interactions constrain network architecture. Proposed Activities Generation of network models The Mukhtar group will curate interaction data and use it to build models for yeast, E. coli, and C. elegans based on in vivo and high-throughput datasets. For each protein, we will compute multiple centrality measures—including degree, betweenness, eigenvector, closeness, load, PageRank, and weighted k-shell decomposition—using Python and Cytoscape. Node prioritization algorithms will identify influential proteins through composite metrics, and clustering will be performed with MCODE and Cytoscape visualization. We will also integrate single-cell and condition-specific data from GEO to parameterize context-dependent networks with the aid of contextual AI models. Functional enrichment analyses using GO, WikiPathways, and related databases will contextualize biological meaning. Generation of biophysical descriptors To determine whether proteins with particular structural properties cluster in networks, we will compare each protein’s centrality to predicted stability and disorder features. Using disorder prediction resources, we will distinguish structured from disordered proteins and estimate absolute stability for structured proteins through generative modeling and simulation-based validation. These stability descriptors will categorize proteins as stable, unstable, or disordered. Enrichment analyses will then test whether high-centrality proteins are overrepresented in these categories, and thresholds will be varied to assess robustness. Additional node annotations such as chaperones or phase-separating proteins will be incorporated to identify biochemical phenomena correlated with centrality. Data from proteolysis, turnover, and expression experiments will be integrated to evaluate associations between network position and proteostasis dynamics. Generation of evolutionary models The Serohijos and Shakhnovich groups have developed integrative models of protein evolution combining biophysics, cellular properties, and population genetics. These models, expanded to proteome scale, will incorporate chaperone and disorder effects. The model includes a fitness function linking native folding probability to free energy and chaperone efficiency, a description of random mutation effects, and an evolutionary algorithm implementing selection. The fitness of complexes will depend on protein stabilities, binding affinities, and abundances, satisfying the law of mass action across the proteome. Random mutations will alter folding and binding based on established datasets, and their selective advantages will be evaluated by fitness comparisons and fixation probabilities. This framework will allow exploration of how mutations affecting stability or binding influence network connectivity and evolution. Outcomes This work will clarify how variations in protein stability and disorder shape the architecture of protein interaction networks. We expect that unstable proteins will display higher degree than stable ones and cluster around chaperone hubs, while disordered proteins dependent on specific partners will maintain their positions across networks. Simulations will demonstrate how these interactions impose constraints on network evolution. Collectively, these results will establish a biophysical foundation for understanding how protein properties give rise to network connectivity and robustness. Working Group Rationale The project merges computational biophysics, systems biology, and evolutionary modeling. The Schlebach lab contributes expertise in protein biophysics and structural informatics; the Mukhtar lab contributes network biology and graph analysis capabilities; and the Serohijos lab contributes evolutionary modeling. The Shakhnovich lab provides complementary theoretical expertise linking these approaches to metabolic organization. This collaboration will enable the integration of data, methods, and trainees across disciplines. Rationale for NCEMS Support The investigations represent a new direction requiring computational infrastructure and collaborative coordination. NCEMS support will facilitate data integration, provide computing resources, and enable administrative and logistical support for efficient collaboration. Requested Resources The project requests a staff scientist and assistant, cyberinfrastructure including storage and computing hours, travel and publication support, and resources for personnel exchange. Proposed Timeline Major milestones include construction of interaction networks for multiple species, computation of centrality metrics, generation of protein stability estimates, annotation of chaperones and disordered proteins, enrichment analyses, and development of genetic algorithms for evolutionary simulation.",Accepted,10.0
human_6,human,human,human,Elucidating emergent structures in cellular RNA-protein interaction networks,"Messenger RNA molecules are constantly bound by proteins that regulate all aspects of their function, including their processing, localization, translation, and degradation1. These mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) can also interact with each other and assemble into higher-order structures that play critical roles in cellular organization and response to environmental stimuli1-3. Despite their importance, we lack a comprehensive map of these cellular RNA-protein interaction networks at both the nano and micro scales. Years of efforts by researchers across the globe have yielded a large, but disjointed, collection of datasets that map different aspects of RNA-protein interactions. Currently, we lack tools to integrate these datasets, preventing their synthesis into a coherent and interpretable interaction map. Here, we propose to develop tools to combine disparate data types to build transcriptome-wide maps of mRNPs, and their higher-order interactions within cells. We will then apply these tools to gain insights into long-standing biological mysteries, including the impacts of synonymous mutations and cell-type specific effects of widely expressed RNAs.",Kalli Kappel; Steven Boeynaems,"Introduction and Goals RNA is Life’s prime messenger molecule of genetic information. While for all organisms—minus some viral exceptions—DNA provides long-term storage, RNA is its direct output, relaying this genetic info into molecular actions. Messenger RNA instructs the ribosomes to fabricate the plethora of proteins that carry out most cellular and biochemical functions. There are also non-coding RNAs that serve mostly structural, enzymatic or regulatory functions. For example, long non-coding RNAs like NEAT1 RNA recruit specific sticky proteins to form biochemically distinct subcellular compartments called paraspeckles—a type of biomolecular condensate. Ribosomal RNA is a prime example of a catalytic RNA or ribozyme, and small RNAs like micro RNAs can regulate the abundance of other RNA species. While it is clear that RNAs carry out essential functions in cells, they do not act alone. It is well understood that RNAs are never naked in the cellular environment. Cells harbor hundreds of RNA-binding proteins that can decorate RNA molecules depending on their specific nucleotide sequence and secondary structure or simply based on the inherent negative charge of the RNA backbone. So, for every RNA molecule, from the moment it emerges from the polymerase transcription bubble, there will be a complex, spatially and temporally dynamic set of protein interaction partners that dictate its processing and structural remodeling, its transport through the cell, its biochemical function and eventual decay. Given that most of these RNA-protein complexes are considered to form their own single entity, they each present as a wildly complex and dynamic microcosm of different proteins interacting with a single RNA. Moreover, all of these proteins can have specific or non-specific interactions with each other—based on their biochemical composition, structure and disorder—that affect each other’s behavior and the eventual mRNP composition. Given such complexity and the breadth of potential RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, it is highly unlikely that the sum of each of these individual components is sufficient to explain the outcome. On the contrary, new unexpected behaviors are bound to emerge from this complexity. We argue that mRNPs are one of the best examples to study emergent behavior in an essential cellular process for life on this planet. The goal of this project is to create a roadmap to understand the composition of the cell’s many thousands of RNPs, focusing specifically on mRNA-protein complexes and their higher order interactions, by integrating available experimental RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interaction data using recent state-of-the-art computational tools for predicting protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. We postulate that this will allow us to come up with a predictive framework to understand the emergent behaviors that arise from mRNP composition. We will validate the predictive power of our framework through the lens of human sequence variation dictating RNA abundance and splicing, the robustness or sensitivity of splicing to RNA-binding protein loss, and the composition of higher-order biomolecular structures that form when individual mRNPs form environmentally-triggered condensates. Proposed Activities Integrate publicly available datasets to build a transcriptome-wide map of mRNPs. In cells, mRNA molecules are constantly bound by proteins, which regulate nearly every aspect of their processing, localization, translation, and degradation. As such, there have been numerous efforts to systematically map mRNA-protein interactions in cells, resulting in a long list of large-scale and transcriptome-wide datasets. These datasets have been generated through many different experimental techniques, each measuring a different aspect of these interactions, making it nontrivial to compare and combine them. Without the ability to integrate these measurements, we lack a transcriptome-wide mRNP map—we have a fragmented and incomplete understanding of the composition and architecture of mRNPs, despite an abundance of data. We hypothesize that a transcriptome-wide mRNP map would help mechanistically explain several long-standing biological mysteries, including how synonymous mutations and mutations in non-coding regions of RNA molecules impact cellular function, and why mutations in RNA molecules that are widely expressed have highly cell-type specific effects. Here, to address this challenge, we will develop a method to integrate disparate datasets, which report on multiple aspects of RNA-protein interactions, to build complete mRNP maps; apply this method to build a transcriptome-wide mRNP map for K562 cells; and use this map to predict and develop mechanistic hypotheses for RNA fate upon genetic perturbation. Develop a method to integrate disparate datasets to build complete mRNP maps. Our goal is to develop a computational method that takes a set of disparate RNA-protein interaction datasets as input and outputs an mRNP map consisting of mRNA molecules and bound proteins including specific nucleotides at which they are bound. We will first collect all publicly available datasets that report on different aspects of RNA-protein interactions in cells. To integrate the datasets, we will develop a set of linked features that connect each pair of data modalities. A linked feature is a shared characteristic or metric that is either directly measured by both datasets or can be reliably inferred from their respective measurements. These linked features will then serve as anchors for data normalization and integration. We will test multiple linked features and normalization approaches and assess their accuracy using the β-actin mRNP, which has been extensively characterized at high resolution. By linking all data modalities to transcriptome-wide mapping of protein-binding sites, this will result in a transcriptome-wide mRNP map. Build a transcriptome-wide mRNP map for K562 cells. We will extend the tool developed above to identify additional proteins that may be part of each mRNP. We will identify protein interaction partners for each protein member of each mRNP by utilizing data from existing protein-protein interaction databases and by predicting protein-protein interactions with AlphaFold for structured domains and with FINCHES for interactions between intrinsically disordered regions. Input to this tool will be a list of mRNP components and a parameter specifying the number of layers of connections to predict. We will apply this tool using data collected for K562 cells to build a complete mRNP map for this cell type. We will also assess the signal-to-noise for each dataset by comparing to corresponding high-resolution measurements for the extensively characterized β-actin mRNP, so we can assign confidence scores to each interaction within the mRNP map. Predict RNA fate upon genetic perturbation. To test the predictive power of our framework regarding regulation of RNAs upon perturbation, we will follow two approaches. First, we will determine whether our framework, which takes into account the different proteins and regulatory RNAs that bind a transcript, can explain the effect of a point mutation in the sequence on its eventual abundance or splicing. For example, a mutation may affect an RNA-binding protein or miRNA binding site. Second, we will ask whether our framework reproduces effects seen in RNA-binding protein knockout data. We will then use our model to make mechanistic predictions as to why mutations in RNA molecules that are widely expressed have highly cell-type specific effects. Map out interaction networks of mRNPs. This aim seeks to identify the network of interactions between mRNPs by addressing the following questions: What is the mesoscale interaction network that a given mRNP belongs to? Can we predict what subcellular compartments, such as biomolecular condensates, that a given mRNP would localize to? Can we predict the compositional variability of condensates such as stress granules based on mRNP networks? To this end, our team will pioneer new approaches to map out higher-order interaction networks of mRNPs within cells. We hypothesize that the physicochemical characteristics of mRNPs encode their spatiotemporal properties within living cells. Deploy our mRNP map tool to identify emergent structures of mRNPs. Our goal is to predict higher-order interaction networks of mRNPs. Using the mRNP map tool generated previously, we will determine the network of proteins associated with each mRNP. Protein interaction networks will be analyzed using clustering or community detection algorithms to group proteins into mesoscale networks based on shared physical properties, such as interaction motifs or binding affinities. Our identified clusters will be validated using mass spectrometry crosslinking data and proximity labeling datasets. Finally, we will compare the identified clusters to known protein compositions of individual condensates to assess their alignment with specific biomolecular compartments. Predict mRNP partitioning into biomolecular condensates. Leveraging databases such as CD-Code and RNA Granule Database, we will curate a subset of proteins and RNAs known to localize to stress granules and P bodies, gathering their physicochemical properties, including sequence composition, charge distribution, hydrophobicity, structural disorder, RNA-binding domains, and low-complexity domains. In parallel, we will use the tool developed earlier to identify mRNPs associated with both types of condensates. Based on the curated data, we will design model condensates that incorporate averaged physiological features representative of stress granules and P bodies. Using the Mpipi model, we will perform residue-resolution molecular dynamics simulations to measure the partitioning coefficients of approximately 2,500 mRNPs across both model condensates. This data will then be used to train a neural network capable of predicting the partition coefficient of any given mRNP into either stress granules or P bodies. The model will be validated against existing transcriptome datasets that profile RNAs enriched in stress granules and P bodies under specific conditions. Predict stress granule composition across cell types. Stress granules are some of the most widely studied biomolecular condensates with many datasets on their protein and RNA composition being readily available. Based on the RNA and protein abundance of specific cells, we will use our framework to predict the variance and similarity in stress granule composition. Addressing this question will help us uncover the molecular rules that dictate condensate formation and composition in both a cell-specific and non-specific manner. Outcomes Our work will result in open-source tools for integrating disparate data sources to map RNA-protein interactions at the nano-scale and the meso-scale, as well as specific applications of these tools to explain emergent structures and functional data. We will produce open-source tools for predicting transcriptome-wide mRNP maps from disparate datasets reporting on different aspects of RNA-protein interactions; a transcriptome-wide mRNP map/database for K562 cells containing detailed molecular annotations; an assessment of the predictive power of our mRNP map to explain the functional consequences of genetic perturbations; a database of microscale clusters composed of mRNPs and their interaction partners; an open-source tool to predict the relative localization of any mRNP to stress granules and P bodies; and a model that predicts cell type specific stress granule composition. Rationale for working group approach This project requires several distinct areas of expertise that go far beyond the skill sets of any individual lab. In addition to general subject-matter expertise in RNA-protein interactions, which all participants have, the work will require expertise in machine learning, statistics, molecular biophysics, and bioinformatics to build tools that integrate disparate data sources and create predictive models; molecular simulations to augment existing experimental data and ground our models in biophysics; and deep biological expertise in both RNA-protein interactions and condensates to guide development of useful tools and apply them to discover new biology. Additionally, each of our aims has a large data science component that would benefit from NCEMS Staff Scientist Support. Rationale for NCEMS support This work aligns closely with NCEMS goals: we will develop and apply tools that utilize only publicly available data; it requires close collaboration between three labs with distinct yet complementary skills; and by combining our diverse perspectives, we will address long-standing mysteries including how synonymous and non-coding RNA mutations impact cellular function and why widely expressed RNAs have cell-type specific effects. Additionally, this project will require NCEMS support for collaboration logistics, virtual leadership and team science training, centralized computing and storage through CyVerse, and staff scientist assistance for data science. Requested resources Our project requires 60 TB of data storage to store all datasets and simulation results, 1.35 million CPU hours for simulations, access to approximately 8 GPUs for machine learning, an NCEMS Staff Scientist at 33% FTE for 2 years with expertise in bioinformatics, machine learning, and statistics, an NCEMS Staff Scientist Assistant at 50% FTE for 2 years with expertise in RNP biology and data science, $5,000 for publication costs, and travel funds for in-person kickoff meetings and events. Proposed timeline We expect that this project can be completed with 2 years of NCEMS support. We plan for intermediate outputs, including publications describing tools and databases from the early aims and biological findings from later aims. The project will engage undergraduate teams across participating labs, with staff scientists providing mentorship and coordination. Regular meetings and collaborative writing will ensure integration across all components of the project.",Rejected,4.0
human_7,human,human,human,Oceans of Disorder: Elucidating the Role of Disordered Proteins in Cellular Adaptation,"Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (collectively IDRs) are key regulators of environmental sensing, owing to their ability to undergo conformational changes in response to physicochemical fluctuations. Despite evidence from individual studies, a comprehensive understanding of IDR-driven adaptations across diverse environments remains elusive. The deep sea, characterized by extreme and variable conditions such as temperature, pressure, and salinity, offers a unique opportunity to address this knowledge gap. Over the past decade, large-scale ocean sampling expeditions using shotgun metagenomics have revolutionized our understanding of marine biodiversity, providing access to the genetic diversity of organisms, from microbes to fish, thriving in these extreme habitats. These datasets offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore how IDRs have evolved as molecular sensors to support survival across varied environmental conditions. Here, we will, for the same time, use these metagenomic datasets to systematically characterize IDRs as environmental sensors. Our multidisciplinary team, with expertise in metagenomics, protein biophysics, cell biology, and deep learning, will integrate bioinformatics, simulations, machine learning, and theoretical approaches to uncover sequence-level and functional adaptations of IDRs across marine environments. The outcomes of this research will produce a comprehensive map of IDR adaptations in marine systems, revealing their emergent properties as molecular sensors and actuators. In addition to advancing fundamental insights into stress adaptation and evolutionary biology, this work will inform biotechnological innovations, including engineering robust systems for extreme environments.",Keren Lasker; Jerelle A. Joseph; Alex Holehouse,"Introduction & goals IDRs are emerging as critical components in environmental sensing due to their unique ability to adopt dynamic conformations in response to external stimuli. Unlike structured proteins, IDRs lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, allowing them to function as versatile molecular sensors capable of adapting to physicochemical changes. While several studies have highlighted the role of IDRs in stress adaptation, a systematic understanding of how IDRs enable organisms to thrive under extreme and fluctuating conditions remains a major knowledge gap. The marine environment serves as a unique natural laboratory for investigating how life adapts to variable conditions, including temperature, salinity, and pressure. The Tara Oceans project, launched in 2009, has been instrumental in advancing this understanding. Over four years, using standardized protocols, Tara Oceans systematically collected over 30,000 samples from more than 200 ocean stations, including depths reaching 2,000 meters. These samples encompass various environmental conditions and yielded a vast metagenomic dataset with millions of novel sequences from viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Analyses of this dataset have revealed temperature as a key driver of microbial community structure and uncovered previously unknown gene families. Leveraging Tara's dataset, we will, for the first time, focus on the biophysical properties of individual proteins to uncover how they enable organisms to thrive in distinct marine environments. To achieve this, we are developing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates metagenomics, biophysical simulations, and machine learning with environmental metadata. Our project is organized around three goals: catalog and annotate IDRs by identifying them in marine protein sequences and correlating their biophysical properties with environmental parameters, simulate IDR dynamics by performing biophysical simulations of IDR dynamics under varying environmental conditions to extract key structural features, and elucidate IDR adaptation mechanisms by linking sequence-level features to functional biophysical properties and environmental stimuli. The outcomes of this work will address critical gaps in our understanding of IDRs functionality across diverse environments and provide a foundation for broader applications. Identifying universal principles of IDR adaptation will reveal protein plasticity mechanisms and enable the engineering of adaptable systems. Proposed activities Activity 1: Building a catalog of IDRs in marine proteins across environmental parameters We will build a comprehensive catalog of IDRs in marine proteins, correlating their biophysical properties with key environmental parameters, including temperature, salinity, and ocean depth. This work leverages the Ocean Gene Atlas v2.0, a publicly available database derived from the Tara Oceans expedition, which provides extensive marine protein data. This expedition standardized sampling methodologies, collecting 12,543 samples across diverse marine ecosystems, encompassing 472 unique sampling events. These samples span a broad range of environmental conditions, including temperatures from 0 to 30 °C, ocean depths from 0 to 1000 m, and salinities between 30 to 40 PSU. Linking marine proteins to environmental and genomic parameters. We will curate the OGA2 database, which contains approximately 45 million prokaryotic and 10 million eukaryotic protein sequences, to connect protein sequences with their environmental and genomic contexts. OGA2 includes protein abundance data and environmental metadata for each sampling location. We hypothesize that protein orthologs span diverse environments, allowing us to associate protein features with specific environmental conditions. Expanding on this analysis, we will systematically annotate each protein with the range of environmental conditions where it is detected. Additionally, we will link each protein to metagenome-associated genomes in the OceanDNA database to incorporate genomic metadata such as genome size and GC content. Annotating and structurally characterizing marine proteins. We will predict the structure of each protein using ESMFold and AlphaFold3. Domains will be identified using an integrative approach combining UniProt annotations, Chainsaw (a convolutional neural network for detection of structural domains), and Metapredict (a deep learning-based consensus predictor of IDRs). For ordered domains, we will extract detailed structural features, including secondary structures, dimensions, surface chemistry, and functional annotations where available. For disordered regions, we will extract sequence-derived features using CIDER. Labeling IDRs based on biophysical properties. IDRs will be labeled according to their intrinsic biophysical properties using ALBATROSS, a deep learning-based approach for predicting IDR ensembles under physiological conditions. ALBATROSS enables assignment of properties such as radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, asphericity, Flory scaling exponent, and prefactor. Since ALBATROSS was trained for physiological conditions, its reliability may decrease under extreme conditions. To address this, we will incorporate additional biophysical labels derived from molecular dynamics simulations, as outlined in Activity 2. Activity 2: Coarse-grained simulations to decipher IDR properties under different environmental conditions The functional versatility of IDRs derives from their 3D conformations, which cannot be directly inferred from their sequences. These conformations are expected to adapt dynamically to environmental changes, potentially encoding mechanisms for adaptation. To investigate these hypotheses, we will study IDR conformations using coarse-grained simulations under a range of environmental conditions. Specifically, we will simulate IDRs across gradients of temperature and salinity to capture their biophysical properties and structural responses. These simulations will provide detailed 3D conformational data for IDRs in marine proteins, offering insights into their adaptive mechanisms. Our approach leverages residue-level coarse-grained models that enable the efficient exploration of long timescales and larger molecular systems. To analyze the resulting high-dimensional data, we will integrate advanced deep learning techniques, including graph neural networks and variational autoencoders, to extract structural features and annotate IDR properties. Simulating IDRs under different environmental conditions. Building on insights from Activity 1, we will group homologous IDRs and select representative IDRs per protein homolog to create a diverse yet focused dataset for analysis. Coarse-grained one-bead-per-residue molecular dynamics simulations will be conducted for these representative IDRs. To enable extended timescale simulations and comprehensive trajectory sampling, we will employ chemically specific, residue-level coarse-grained models to simulate IDRs under specific environmental conditions: salt concentration gradients using the Mpipi-Recharge model and temperature gradients using a custom in-house model developed by our team. Pressure effects will not be simulated due to the absence of a validated coarse-grained model. Simulations will be performed using the open-source LAMMPS software. We will run each IDR at three temperatures and three salt concentrations, totaling eight simulated ensembles, excluding the case near physiological conditions, which will be annotated in Activity 1. Annotating biophysical properties that arise in simulations under a range of environmental conditions. We will employ deep learning-based methods to extract critical information from high-dimensional simulation data, focusing on uncovering conformational representations and structural propensities of IDRs. By leveraging advanced clustering and neural network techniques, we will learn nonlinear representations that disentangle key variation factors, capture invariant structural features, and enable the transfer of insights across diverse IDR populations. Specifically, we will integrate variational autoencoders, graph neural networks, and generative adversarial networks to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories under diverse environmental conditions. This approach will result in an ensemble decoder that outputs multi-vector conformational matrices, highlighting key features such as global conformations, pairwise contacts, and secondary structures, which collectively annotate IDR biophysical responses. Activity 3: Mapping the mechanisms of IDR adaptation and Engineering Environmentally Resilient IDRs We will uncover the molecular principles governing the adaptation of IDRs to diverse environmental conditions. By identifying chemical features of IDRs that correlate with environmental variables, we will elucidate universal properties that can be fine-tuned to enable IDR adaptability. Comparative analyses of IDRs from orthologous proteins across different environmental contexts will reveal chemical adaptations required to maintain essential protein functions. These insights will culminate in the development of a framework for designing IDRs with enhanced adaptability and functionality tailored to specific conditions. Identification of essential molecular features for IDR adaptation. To understand how IDRs adapt to environmental conditions, we will employ machine learning approaches to distill high-dimensional sequence and biophysical data into a low-dimensional latent space. This space will encapsulate critical features, such as compositional biases and environmentally dependent biophysical properties. Key steps include data distillation, where supervised or semi-supervised machine learning models encode sequence and property data into a compact latent representation; feature mapping, where environmental parameters are overlaid onto the latent space to identify how IDRs modulate their features to adapt; and validation, where comparative analysis with conventional dimensionality reduction techniques ensures robustness while enabling mutational and functional predictions that extend beyond conventional methods. Predicting evolutionary trajectories and designing novel IDR sequences. Building on these insights, we will model evolutionary trajectories and design IDRs optimized for specific biophysical and environmental properties. Adaptation trajectory prediction will use generative modeling frameworks to simulate IDR adaptation under progressive environmental conditions, allowing us to predict how sequence features evolve to optimize functionality. We will validate predicted trajectories by comparing them to adaptation trajectories in our dataset and cross-referencing experimental data. Adaptive rule discovery will identify how variations in sequence features influence adaptation, enabling formulation of design rules for engineering environmentally resilient IDRs. Using the latent space as a generative tool, we will design novel IDR sequences with desired biophysical properties. These sequences will be tested computationally and experimentally through collaborations with biophysics experts. This framework will enable creation of IDPs tailored for synthetic biology and environmental resilience. Expected outcomes This research will provide transformative insights into the adaptive mechanisms of IDRs in marine proteins, elucidating their role in survival across environmental gradients such as depth, salinity, and temperature. By cataloging IDRs alongside their biophysical properties and environmental metadata, we will establish the first comprehensive database linking IDR biophysical features to environmental contexts. This database will serve as a foundational resource for understanding the evolutionary adaptations of IDRs. Through large-scale simulations and machine learning models, we expect to uncover universal chemical features that govern IDR adaptability. These findings will address critical knowledge gaps and provide a foundation for engineering environmentally adaptable proteins. The resulting tools and frameworks will have broad applicability, extending beyond marine systems to other biological contexts, and paving the way for advances in synthetic biology, biotechnology, and evolutionary studies. We anticipate multiple publishable outcomes from this work, including a database of marine IDRs cataloging sequence features and environmental metadata, large-scale simulations and biophysical analyses revealing key adaptive features, a machine learning-based predictor of IDR adaptation pathways, and a computational tool for the de novo design of IDRs tailored to specific environmental niches. Rationale for the working group collaborative approach The scope and interdisciplinary demands of this project are beyond what a single lab can address alone. Understanding the interactions between IDR sequence, structure, and function across diverse environments requires expertise in multiple disciplines, including metagenomics, biophysics, and machine learning. By combining these skill sets, our working group provides a unique platform to tackle the project's challenges effectively. Metagenomics and bioinformatics experts will curate and analyze large datasets of marine proteins, annotate IDRs with environmental and genomic parameters, and uncover adaptation trends. This work establishes a foundation for identifying patterns of IDR adaptation across ecosystems. Biophysics and modeling experts will utilize advanced simulation tools developed by members of the working group for modeling IDR behavior under diverse environmental conditions, offering unparalleled insights into conformational dynamics and adaptation mechanisms. Machine learning experts will apply advanced algorithms to analyze high-dimensional molecular dynamics data, extracting structural and functional insights and enabling predictive modeling and design of novel, environmentally adaptable IDRs. By combining these areas of expertise, the working group fosters innovation and ensures the creation of broadly applicable tools and frameworks. Rationale for NCEMS support This project requires NCEMS support and resources because its scope and complexity extend beyond the capabilities of a single lab or existing collaborations. NCEMS's infrastructure and expertise make it an ideal partner to address the following critical needs: simulation management for approximately 440,000 molecular dynamics trajectories; database development to catalog IDRs and integrate biophysical properties with environmental metadata; collaborative infrastructure to support interdisciplinary synergy; and AI expertise to extract connections between IDR sequences, environmental factors, and adaptation mechanisms. Requested resources We request a 33% FTE Staff Scientist to help design and build the IDR catalog, develop data analysis strategies, and identify relationships between IDR behaviors and environmental conditions; a 50% FTE Staff Scientist Assistant to manage and curate molecular dynamics simulations and support infrastructure; approximately 26 million CPU hours for large-scale simulations; and 52 TB of data storage. Proposed Timeline The project spans 24 months. The first 6 months will focus on designing and building the IDR catalog. Months 5–16 will involve running and curating simulations, processing approximately 440,000 trajectories, and publishing preliminary findings. Year 2 will leverage results from simulations to develop predictive models and design de novo IDRs, culminating in final publications and public release of the tools and datasets.",Accepted,8.0
human_8,human,human,human,Multimodel single-cell frameworks for cell lines with extensive multi-omics data,"Large-scale consortia like the Dependency Map and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia have generated extensive multi-omics data for over 2000 primary cell lines, including bulk measurements of DNA, chromatin accessibility, RNA, and proteins. Recently, multi-omics single-cell sequencing and imaging data labeling RNA and proteins for these cell lines have become increasingly available. However, these datasets remain fragmented, lacking integration into a unified framework to model and quantify DNA, RNA, and protein within the same cell. While previous efforts have created multimodal benchmark datasets, these often include diverse samples from multiple donors and heterogeneous cell types. In contrast, our project focuses on single model systems, such as commonly used cell lines, which already feature extensive single-cell, bulk sequencing, and imaging data. By eliminating donor and cell type variability, our approach enables robust analyses and precise alignment across modalities, including RNA, protein, and chromatin accessibility. This focus on homogenous cell types within a consistent biological context facilitates mechanistic studies of regulatory interactions and perturbation responses, minimizing confounding variability. We aim to develop multimodal frameworks for 7 cell lines and computational pipelines to analyze relationships across DNA, RNA, and protein levels. By incorporating additional multi-omics data, including bulk and single-cell perturbation datasets (e.g., loss-of-function screens and Perturb-seq), we will create a comprehensive benchmarking resource. With expertise in machine learning, network biology, and genomics, and NCEMS support for data wrangling, our team will deliver tools to study regulatory mechanisms and cellular resource allocation. These efforts will foster fundamental discoveries, community-driven resource development, and innovation in multi-omics research.",Elizabeth Brunk; Hyebin Song; Ferhat Ay; Vasant Honavar; William Noble,,Accepted,9.0
human_9,human,human,human,From image data and biophysical simulations to principles of mesoscale organization through integrated transfer learning,"Mesoscale cellular organization emerges from complex interactions among chemical, structural, and physical components. Understanding how mesoscale structures influence local and collective cellular properties remains a significant challenge, often beyond the scope of individual experimental studies. While vast image datasets for cellular components exist, their full potential for deeper secondary analysis and synthesis remains untapped. We propose to synthesize morphological and physico-chemical measurements from cell image, in vitro, and in silico data to unravel the principles of mesoscale cellular organization. Our approach will develop a pipeline using transfer learning and mutual prediction, trained on complete datasets (all components of interest present) and applied to incomplete datasets (missing one or more components). This methodology will uncover relationships between cellular components and enable holistic systems-level predictions. To demonstrate the generalizability and biological relevance of this approach, we will test it on three increasingly complex mesoscale systems centered on the nucleus: (1) nucleus-nucleolus, (2) nucleus-centrosome-microtubules, and (3) nucleus-mitochondria-mitochondrial condensates. These test cases will showcase how our method integrates and predicts complex systems relationships, advancing our understanding of mesoscale cellular organization.",Mary Mirvis; Adriana Dawes,"Background Understanding mesoscale cellular organization requires investigating the interplay of physical forces, spatial constraints, and interactions between cellular components. Advances in morphological profiling, spatial and organellar proteomics, and generative whole-cell modeling have laid the foundation for mapping organizational patterns on scales ranging from molecules to organelles. However, achieving a holistic view of what drives mesoscale organization necessitates integrating these components across each other and with biophysical principles. This proposal shifts focus from traditional gene/protein-centric views to explore how physical principles and geometric constraints give rise to cellular architecture. By combining existing cell imaging data, in vitro reconstitution of mesoscale structures, and published outcomes of molecular simulations, we aim to develop a framework to predict how cellular architectures emerge from the localization, morphology, and interactions of components. This integrative approach will uncover emergent behaviors and previously unidentified features in high-dimensional datasets. Quantitative comparisons across high-dimensional datasets are challenging due to differences in data space. Traditional methods like clustering require data to reside in a single space, but advances in metric geometry, particularly Gromov-Wasserstein distances, enable comparisons across distinct spaces. Recent applications of GW distances have demonstrated their utility in aligning single-cell data and comparing biological networks and time-series data. Here, we propose leveraging GW distances to develop transfer learning algorithms to integrate biological datasets of mesoscale structures. This approach addresses critical gaps in cross-space learning, enabling rigorous integrative analyses of multimodal data. Driving Questions How much of mesoscale cell organization arises from intrinsic physical properties of structures versus their interactions? What role do mesoscale interactions play in determining the morphological and physico-chemical properties of cytoskeletal, organelle, and condensate components? Can a transfer learning approach infer morphological and physical properties of mesoscale structures from joint and incomplete datasets to address these questions and beyond? Proposed Activities Generalizable computational analysis and modeling approach Our approach integrates multicomponent image data to predict unseen properties in incomplete datasets. We extract high-dimensional morphological feature sets describing component size, shape, number, position, and inter-component interactions. Dynamic metrics, such as positional and shape changes, are included for live-cell data. Dimensional reduction generates interpretable feature spaces, which can be tuned for exploratory or hypothesis-driven studies, including granular dissection of cross-component interdependencies and contextual comparisons such as drug treatments, disease states, and cell types. The feature space is sampled along statistical dimensions to reveal feature covariance and specific feature evolutions. Using GW distance analysis to go beyond by-eye interpretations, we quantitatively describe feature covariance and predictive relationships between components. This two-step approach integrates and learns from data across cellular contexts: Step 1: Integrate data across cells. Multicomponent images are aligned via GW distances, generating pairwise similarity matrices for features of interest. This enables comparisons across distinct data spaces, leveraging complex features such as organelle shape. Step 2: Infer feature relationships. Deep learning on alignment matrices reveals predictive relationships between features. Generative adversarial networks under GW distance and transfer learning algorithms facilitate inference, validated using open-source datasets. To tackle the complexity of cellular data, we will incorporate data from minimal systems to compare intrinsic properties in isolated components versus cellular contexts and test whether morphology predicts physical or chemical properties. These data reveal the intrinsic properties of the component in isolation, providing a baseline for comparison with the cellular context. Morphological and physical feature spaces extracted from in vitro and in silico data will be compared with cell image features. New simulations will be developed to ask whether inter-component interactions could close the gap between minimal system and cellular feature distributions. If not, this could indicate that other interactors or environmental factors need to be incorporated. Translating images, which are high-dimensional representations of reality, into physical models requires a combination of approaches. First, we analyze images to extract the underlying physics using low-dimensional models. Second, GW distance analysis can form the basis for standard granular agent-based models. We aim to develop physical models alongside molecular and cellular descriptions to identify mechanisms governing complex processes. Application of workflow to test cases We will refine our workflow by applying it to three mesoscale interaction systems: Nucleus and Nucleolus. Integration of image and minimal system data will explore universal principles governing nucleolar morphology, dynamics, and chromatin interactions. In vitro and simulation data for nucleoli revealing biophysical properties such as surface tension and fluidity will be incorporated. Nucleus, centrosome, and microtubules. This system spans membrane-bound, condensate, and cytoskeletal components. Using multicomponent imaging datasets, we will reconstruct three-part feature relationships from two-component feature relationships and validate findings with in vitro data for microtubules and centrosome. The visibility of all three components in tubulin staining patterns will be leveraged to predict missing components from single-component images. Mitochondria, mitochondrial nucleoids, and nucleus. We examine how morphological properties of mitochondrial nucleoids, which behave as biomolecular condensates, are related to mitochondrial and nuclear structure and function. High-throughput imaging of fibroblasts from healthy and HGPS patients, where mitochondrial nucleoid morphology is altered, will reveal links between structural changes and cellular aging and enable prediction of mitochondrial nucleoid properties in other images. Integration and Synthesis The nucleus serves as an anchor point across test cases due to its extensive biological characterization and rich representation across multicomponent and minimal system data types. After initial workflow implementation, findings will be integrated into a larger model incorporating all components across test cases with the nucleus at the nexus, revealing new mesoscale interactions. Limitations in dataset availability, findability, and quality will likely necessitate further data scouting, particularly for in vitro and in silico data. Systematic literature synthesis methods adapted from the interdisciplinary community will provide complementary insights, building on novel applications for fundamental cell biology currently under development by Mary Mirvis. This combined approach will give insight into variability and reproducibility of findings, supporting robust statistical analyses and modeling efforts. Outcomes The project will yield key outcomes aimed at advancing our understanding of mesoscale cellular organization. These include: a generalizable analytical framework, a computational pipeline leveraging GW distances and transfer learning to analyze multicomponent imaging datasets; predictive models validated for inferring unseen properties from incomplete datasets; integrated datasets combining cell image, in vitro, and in silico sources; and new biophysical insights into mesoscale structure-function relationships spanning sub-nucleus dynamics, organelle interactions, and cytoskeletal organization. Broader Impacts By enabling the integration of diverse datasets, the project will facilitate systems-level analyses of cellular organization and dynamic processes. The generalizable methods will benefit disciplines ranging from biophysics to computational biology. Additionally, by providing new tools and datasets, the work will empower researchers to explore previously intractable mesoscale and multiscale cellular organization questions. Rationale for a Working Group Approach The proposed work requires expertise in computational image analysis, statistical and mathematical modeling including machine learning and simulations, biological and biophysical insight into specific test cases, and deep subject matter expertise for meaningful interpretation of results. No single lab possesses all of these qualities, but our group includes field leaders in all relevant fields. A multi-lab collaboration also expands access to additional complete and well-documented datasets, enhancing the robustness and impact of our analyses. Rationale for NCEMS Support Our proposal builds on several open-source data and methods resources and aims to produce an open-source, highly generalizable data integration workflow to benefit the scientific community, strongly in line with NCEMS’ mission. We will require IT support from NCEMS due to the computational demands of GW distance analyses, which are computationally expensive. Additionally, high-resolution image data necessitates substantial data storage resources, another area where NCEMS can provide critical support. Furthermore, this project involves extensive data and knowledge synthesis, including the integration of image datasets and feature data from dynamic and static cell images, in vitro studies, and simulations, as well as comprehensively synthesized published findings. NCEMS support can enhance these efforts by facilitating systematic curation and pooling of smaller datasets, assembling a large, diverse corpus. These efforts address gaps in publicly available resources, enabling broader applications of the pipeline. Requested Resources We expect to use TensorFlow and PyTorch to train deep learning models and the POT Python library to compute GW distances. For each instance of model training, we expect approximately two hours of training time per GPU, with total time depending on the need to train additional models. Initially, we estimate requiring at least ten thousand GPU hours, with this demand scaling proportionally as additional datasets are integrated into the analysis. High-resolution imaging datasets and intermediate data products, including simulation outputs, will require substantial storage capacity, estimated at approximately fifty terabytes for the duration of the project. Assistance from NCEMS and CYVERSE IT specialists will be critical for optimizing workflows, managing data transfers, and ensuring compatibility between datasets and computational tools. As part of the project’s data synthesis efforts, we also require support for systematic dataset curation and integration, including scouting and pooling smaller datasets from literature and open-source repositories. Proposed Timeline A two-year timeline is appropriate for the proposed work. Development of the core workflow for cell image feature space comparison for two-component test cases is expected to take at least six months. Further refinement, expansion to three-component systems, incorporation of additional data types, and integration across test cases will extend through the second year, depending on availability of data, resources, and personnel.",Rejected,12.0
human_10,human,human,human,Transposable elements and the emergence of genomic innovation,"Our working group aims to comprehensively investigate how transposable elements (TEs) contribute to genomic innovation and species diversification in vertebrates through the generation of novel functional elements. While TEs comprise nearly half of the human genome and are increasingly recognized as sources of regulatory innovation, their repetitive nature has complicated their analysis using short-read sequencing technologies. We propose a two-phase approach: First, we will reprocess tens of thousands of publicly available genomic datasets (including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and Ribo-seq) using repeat-aware analysis pipelines and new telomere-to-telomere and pangenome assemblies. Second, we will synthesize this reprocessed data to understand how TEs generate new transcription factor binding sites, cell-specific and species-specific enhancers, novel transcripts, and protein-coding sequences. The project combines multidisciplinary expertise from multiple labs and will leverage advanced computational approaches to uncover complex relationships between TEs and regulatory networks. Our investigation represents a quintessential mesoscale emergence phenomenon, bridging molecular-level TE insertions with emergent regulatory networks and phenotypic innovations. The project will produce both a comprehensive public data resource of repeat-aware genomic analyses and new insights into how TEs drive biological innovation through regulatory network evolution.",Shaun Mahony,"Introduction Transposable elements are mobile genetic elements that can insert themselves into new genomic locations, resulting in duplication of DNA. Nearly half of the human genome originates from transposon activity. Since their discovery by Barbara McClintock, their biological and evolutionary roles have been debated. Once dismissed as “junk DNA,” they are now recognized as key drivers of genomic innovation, creating new regulatory elements and contributing to evolutionary diversification. For instance, a large fraction of primate-specific transcription factor binding sites are derived from transposable elements. This means TEs have played a fundamental role in shaping species-specific gene regulation. However, their repetitive nature complicates functional characterization with sequencing-based assays. High-throughput methods like ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq rely on short reads that often map ambiguously to repetitive regions, producing multi-mapped reads that most pipelines discard. As a result, much of the genome’s repetitive and TE-rich regions remain underexplored in existing analyses. Recent advances in both computational and sequencing technologies now make it possible to revisit these regions with improved accuracy. Telomere-to-telomere and pangenome assemblies fill previous gaps in reference genomes, providing a more complete representation of repetitive DNA. New probabilistic read allocation methods, such as Allo, allow recovery of signals from multi-mapped reads, substantially increasing the detection of functional genomic elements associated with TEs. Preliminary analyses already show large gains in identified binding sites when accounting for such reads. Together, these technological advances provide an unprecedented opportunity to systematically characterize the functional roles of TEs across genomes and species. Goals This project aims to determine how transposable elements generate novel functional elements that drive phenotypic diversification across vertebrates. We will reprocess large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, and ribosome profiling datasets using repeat-aware pipelines and integrate them across data modalities, cell types, and species to answer fundamental biological questions. The key questions include: How do TEs generate new transcription factor binding sites, and which transcription factors preferentially bind to specific TE families? How do TEs give rise to cell-type- or species-specific enhancers? How do they contribute to novel transcripts and protein-coding sequences? Addressing these questions will illuminate how molecular-level TE insertions give rise to new regulatory networks and biological functions. Proposed Activities Phase 1: Reprocessing regulatory genomics data with repeat-aware pipelines We will work with computational staff to reprocess tens of thousands of publicly available genomic datasets using repeat-aware methods. This includes ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq (for transcription factors and histone marks), RNA-seq, and Ribo-seq from major consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, FAANG, and GTEx, along with vertebrate comparative data. Both human and mouse datasets will be aligned to telomere-to-telomere assemblies for maximum genome coverage, and human data will also be aligned to pangenome assemblies to capture population-level structural variation. Reads will be mapped using standard aligners configured to retain multiple mapping locations, followed by probabilistic allocation of multi-mapped reads using tools such as Allo and Rcount. Peak calling and quantification will be performed on these reprocessed data to generate consistent repeat-aware maps of regulatory activity, transcription, and translation. This phase will produce a comprehensive collection of regulatory and expression datasets that accurately capture activity within repetitive regions of the genome. Phase 2: Data synthesis to understand the role of TEs in generating functional elements Building on Phase 1, we will integrate and analyze the repeat-aware datasets to uncover patterns of TE-derived functional innovation. We will identify TE-derived transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, transcripts, and translated sequences by intersecting data with RepeatMasker annotations and evaluating their conservation across species using multi-species alignments. Chromatin states will be annotated using hidden Markov models, enabling classification of TE-derived regions as promoters, enhancers, or other regulatory states across different cell types. Statistical analyses will assess associations between TE families, transcription factors, gene expression, and tissue specificity. Beyond correlation-based approaches, we will apply integrative methods such as tensor decomposition to identify higher-order dependencies between data modalities—for example, linking specific transcription factors with TE families that activate enhancer programs leading to tissue-specific gene expression. This integrative analysis will reveal how TEs collectively reshape regulatory landscapes. Outcomes The project will yield a comprehensive, publicly accessible collection of reprocessed datasets capturing regulatory and transcriptional activity in repetitive regions, along with reproducible analysis pipelines for repeat-aware genomics. The data and methods will enable researchers to study regions of the genome that were previously inaccessible and to explore how TEs contribute to genomic and phenotypic innovation. Phase 2 will result in research publications describing biological discoveries as well as review papers summarizing best practices for repeat-aware data processing and analysis. Rationale for a Working Group Approach This project brings together complementary expertise in transposon biology, regulatory genomics, evolutionary biology, and computational data integration. Members specialize in distinct but interconnected areas—TE functionalization, TE evolution, enhancer and network evolution, species-specific regulation, and multi-omic data modeling—making collaboration essential. The scale of data reprocessing and integration required exceeds the capabilities of any individual laboratory, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts and shared computational infrastructure. Rationale for NCEMS Support The scope of this project aligns directly with the mission of NCEMS: synthesizing large-scale data to uncover mesoscale emergence phenomena. TE-driven regulatory innovation exemplifies such emergence, linking molecular events like TE insertions to higher-order regulatory networks and organismal diversity. NCEMS support will provide the computational power, storage, and expert personnel required to reprocess over 75,000 datasets, implement integrative analyses, and coordinate multi-lab collaboration. Requested Resources The project requires approximately ten million CPU hours for large-scale data reprocessing and analysis, staff scientist support for pipeline execution and data management, and storage for intermediate and processed datasets. Additional resources will support collaborative meetings, data publication, and personnel exchanges between participating labs. Proposed Timeline The project will span two years, with Phase 1 dedicated to reprocessing datasets and Phase 2 focusing on data integration and biological interpretation. The first year will include an initial meeting to finalize analysis plans and pipelines, followed by repeat-aware reprocessing across data modalities. During the second year, integrated analyses will be conducted, and results will be synthesized into collaborative publications and data resources.",Accepted,1.0
human_11,human,human,human,Searching the crosslinking mass spectrometry universe for new protein-protein interactions,"Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is a powerful structural proteomics method that can provide high-resolution structural information about complex mixtures of proteins in their native physiological context.1,2,3 The method works by chemically crosslinking two reactive amino acid residues that are close to one another in 3-D space, thereby freezing this spatial information into a covalent bond, and then retrieving this information by sequencing crosslinked peptides following enzymatic digest of the constituent proteins (like Hi-C,4 but for proteins). Initially developed in the 2000s to interrogate purified proteins, by the late-2010s, methods became available to interrogate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) on the proteome-scale and in the cellular environment.5 This project seeks to standardize, combine, and integrate existing publicly available crosslinking datasets from PRIDE to make these data more re-usable and useful for integrative and hybrid modeling. We will also create a meta-dataset to catalogue PPIs in human and other model organisms. Because XL-MS encodes information about both protein identity and interacting residues, these findings can be cross-validated to structural predictions of protein complexes using AlphaFold3, thereby providing stronger evidence for their existence compared to huMAP3.0, which predicts protein complexes without structural evidence. We will integrate these findings into the EBI Complex Portal to make it accessible to the life science community.",Stephen D. Fried; Yasset Perez-Riverol; Henning Hermjakob,"Introduction Every protein is connected. The physical interactions made by proteins often define their functions; hence, to understand the whole proteome, we must also have a complete compendium of protein complexes. Several proteomics approaches can be used to infer the existence of a pairwise protein-protein interaction, the fundamental unit of data used to build a model of a protein complex, such as affinity purification mass spectrometry, proximity labeling, co-fractionation mass spectrometry, and photoactivated RNA crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry. Large-scale efforts such as BioPlex have conducted tens of thousands of affinity purification experiments to catalog human protein complexes. huMAP integrates BioPlex data with co-fractionation and proximity labeling datasets, using machine learning to cluster protein pairs into a global network. This network estimates that most human proteins exist in some complex, and its predictions have been incorporated into the EBI Complex Portal, greatly expanding the manually curated human complexes. While these approaches are powerful, none provide structural information or evidence of which residues or interfaces are involved in a protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, these assays require that complexes survive lysis and remain intact in vitro, meaning transient interactions are often missed. Crosslinking mass spectrometry is an orthogonal method that encodes pairwise interactions by sequencing the two peptides derived from two proteins covalently connected through a chemical crosslinker. Originally applied to purified proteins, advances in crosslinker chemistry, mass spectrometry instrumentation, and search software have enabled proteome-wide applications. A contact between any reactive residue on one protein and any reactive residue on another can now be identified and validated. For many years, confidently identifying inter-protein crosslinks in complex samples was challenging because search software could not properly estimate false discovery rates. This limitation has been overcome by new algorithms capable of accurate validation. The XL-MS community has generally made raw data available on PRIDE, a major proteomics repository, but reusability remains limited. Different search algorithms, customized databases, and inconsistent metadata have created barriers to data reuse. Until recently, there was no unified format for reporting processed crosslinking data, and sample metadata were often poorly annotated. Proposed Activities This project has three main activities. The first aims to select large-scale XL-MS datasets from PRIDE, re-annotate them with standardized metadata, and reanalyze them using modern search algorithms to improve data quality and reusability. The second will mine reprocessed data to discover potentially new protein-protein interactions and provide additional validation for existing ones, integrating these validated interactions into the EBI Complex Portal. The third goal, if time permits, is to use the interaction data to suggest potential functions for uncharacterized proteins based on their interaction partners. Reanalysis of XL-MS data on PRIDE There are currently over a thousand PRIDE datasets mentioning crosslinking, though few include complete processed data. Many contain only partial or technical studies without biological context. We will compile a list of biologically meaningful, large-scale XL-MS datasets focused on protein complex and interaction analysis. Each legacy dataset will be reannotated using standardized metadata formats and reprocessed using modern algorithms such as Scout. The results will be redeposited to PRIDE under new accessions as complete standardized submissions, linked to the originals. These will populate a dedicated PRIDE Crosslinking database, providing consistent and accessible data for reuse. Conglomerate Pairwise Residue Interactions to Validate Predicted Complexes A curated subset of large-scale reprocessed datasets across multiple model organisms will be analyzed in depth. Criteria for inclusion will include proteome-wide design, use of cleavable crosslinkers, studies in model organisms such as yeast or human cells, and sufficient experimental scale. Inter-protein crosslinks from these datasets will be pooled and analyzed to validate predicted complexes. For human data, each detected interaction will be compared against huMAP predictions. If the proteins are linked in huMAP, structural modeling with AlphaFold will assess whether the crosslinked residues are spatially proximal in the predicted structure. Verified interactions will increase the evidence level for those complexes in the Complex Portal, annotated with structural and dataset references. Crosslinks not already in huMAP will also be structurally tested, and passing cases will be added to the portal with provisional evidence labels. Similar analyses will be extended to yeast datasets. Additional analyses may include reprocessing affinity purification data from other organisms using quantitative pipelines, clustering them into complexes, and comparing them to XL-MS data using the same validation framework. Proposing Functions for Unannotated Proteins Many human proteins still lack assigned functions. While most functional proteins contain recognizable catalytic domains, uncharacterized proteins may act as scaffolds that mediate specific interactions. To begin annotating these, we will examine XL-MS-derived interaction networks. If an uncharacterized protein interacts with one or more proteins of known function, we will compile examples to identify emerging patterns or network features that may guide hypothesis generation for future studies. Outcomes Reanalysis of PRIDE XL-MS data will yield roughly a hundred large-scale standardized datasets, greatly expanding the number of accessible, biologically relevant crosslinking experiments. These data will facilitate reuse, allow non-specialists to access residue-pair information directly, and ensure compatibility with hybrid modeling databases. Conglomerating residue-level interactions will increase confidence in predicted complexes, refine evidence levels in the Complex Portal, and identify new interactions supported by structural modeling. Preliminary results will support high-impact publications and public data resources. Analyses of uncharacterized proteins may yield hypotheses about their roles and guide future functional studies. Working Group Approach The project requires combined expertise in mass spectrometry, data standards, database engineering, and structural biology. Dr. Fried’s team brings experience in XL-MS and structural biology, while collaborators at the EBI provide critical infrastructure for PRIDE and the Complex Portal, enabling large-scale reanalysis and integration. Manual curation and automation tasks will be supported by dedicated data scientists. This collaboration ensures both scientific depth and technical feasibility. Rationale for NCEMS Support XL-MS data provide unique residue-level evidence of protein-protein interactions but remain underutilized due to inconsistent formats and metadata. NCEMS support is essential to harmonize, reprocess, and integrate these data, linking them to existing structural predictions and interaction networks. This integration aligns with ongoing developments in hybrid structural biology, providing valuable resources for the community. Requested Resources The project requires a data scientist for dataset curation, annotation, and reanalysis, with travel support for collaboration between NCEMS and EBI teams. Computational resources are needed for large-scale reprocessing and structural predictions, estimated at tens of thousands of CPU hours and thousands of AlphaFold runs. Personnel and computational support will ensure timely and reproducible execution. Proposed Timeline The project will span approximately fifteen months. The first six months will focus on dataset reannotation and reprocessing, led by a data scientist with oversight from EBI collaborators. The next six months will focus on structural validation and integration of results into the Complex Portal. The final phase will explore uncharacterized proteins and synthesize results for publication and public release.",Accepted,4.0
human_12,human,human,human,Intelligent metadata compilation to enhance the reusability and discoverability of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data,"Mass spectrometry-based proteomics generates vast amounts of data, yet the effective reuse and discovery of these datasets remain challenging due to incomplete and inconsistent metadata. Metadata, which provides critical contextual information such as experimental conditions, sample characteristics, and data processing details, is essential for making data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). To address these challenges, our working group aims to develop intelligent, automated workflows for comprehensive metadata extraction, harmonization, and integration into PRIDE, the largest public proteomics data repository. We will develop powerful bioinformatics and natural language processing tools to extract metadata directly from raw mass spectrometry files and scientific publications. By leveraging structured data standards, metadata will be enriched with controlled vocabulary terms, enhancing dataset transparency and usability. Community engagement through a machine-learning challenge will further drive innovation in metadata extraction techniques. The outcomes of the working group's activities will include automated metadata compilation workflows integrated into user-friendly tools, advanced dataset querying capabilities in PRIDE, and the creation of educational resources for the scientific community. These efforts will enable researchers to efficiently locate and reuse proteomics datasets, facilitating secondary analyses such as AI model training and large-scale reanalysis.",Wout Bittremieux; Iddo Friedberg,"Introduction and Goals In line with the FAIR principles—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—omics data is increasingly accessible through public repositories tailored to diverse research domains. This surge in data availability has immense potential to accelerate scientific discovery and foster cross-disciplinary innovation. However, the effective findability and reusability of these datasets remain limited, primarily due to a lack of comprehensive metadata. Metadata, which includes details like experimental conditions, sample characteristics, data processing methods, and instrument settings, is critical for transforming raw data into scientifically valuable resources. Unfortunately, metadata is often incomplete, inconsistently structured, or buried in unstructured formats such as free-form text in publications. These shortcomings restrict automated processing, systematic querying, and the discovery of relevant datasets. To bridge this gap, the working group will develop automated methods to extract, refine, and associate high-quality metadata with omics data in public repositories. This initiative will lay the groundwork for improved data discoverability and expanded reusability. While metadata enhancement is relevant across all omics fields, the initial focus is on mass spectrometry-based proteomics due to its complex metadata needs and established annotation frameworks. Specifically, the group will leverage the SDRF-Proteomics format, a structured tab-delimited standard adopted from transcriptomics (MAGE-TAB) by the Proteomics Standards Initiative. SDRF-Proteomics improves data transparency and usability by specifying relationships between samples, assays, and data files. Despite its growing adoption, many datasets remain inconsistently annotated. The group proposes to address this by developing intelligent, automated workflows to systematically gather and associate metadata for proteomics experiments and integrate it into PRIDE, the largest proteomics data repository. The tools will extract technical and biological metadata directly from experimental data, open-access publications, and existing annotations. Extracted metadata will be harmonized using controlled vocabulary and ontology terms and linked to datasets in PRIDE, creating an enriched metadata layer accessible for secondary analyses. To ensure accessibility, a user-friendly interface will be implemented in PRIDE’s web portal, alongside an API for metadata-based queries. Enhanced metadata infrastructure will unlock powerful capabilities for proteomics researchers, such as identifying suitable training datasets for AI tools, enabling automated large-scale reanalyses like differential protein expression profiling, and facilitating re-interpretation of public data in light of new hypotheses. Proposed Activities The project will initially focus on standard bottom-up discovery proteomics workflows, encompassing data-dependent and data-independent acquisition with both label-free and label-based quantitation, as well as post-translational modification-enriched datasets. Time permitting, it will expand to specialized approaches such as crosslinking and hydrogen-deuterium exchange proteomics. This stepwise approach allows controlled validation and extension to other omics disciplines in the future. Metadata retrieval will combine extraction from raw mass spectrometry data with mining of complementary metadata from scientific literature. From raw data, proprietary formats will be converted to mzML, and essential metadata such as instrument type, parameters, and search settings (mass tolerances, digestion enzymes, isobaric labeling strategies) will be derived using existing tools such as Param-Medic. Organism identification will be obtained by matching against reference data, and digestion enzymes and modifications will be determined via open modification searching. These components will be integrated into an automated workflow using Nextflow to streamline extraction and organization. For literature-based metadata, critical contextual information not found in raw data (biological conditions, case/control groupings, disease relevance) will be gathered using a natural language processing pipeline built on large language models fine-tuned for scientific text mining. To ensure accuracy and transparency, the models will indicate unavailable elements, perform self-verification, and use ensemble cross-checking among LLMs. To engage the community, a machine-learning challenge will be launched to drive innovation in metadata extraction. Winning open-source algorithms will be integrated into workflows. Tutorial datasets and documentation will be shared through ProteomicsML, fostering education for both data scientists and proteomics practitioners. To develop and validate the approach, the group will use a curated set of public datasets with SDRF metadata as a gold standard, along with a manually curated private test set as an independent benchmark for evaluating metadata accuracy. Scoring will emphasize precision to ensure high-confidence results. Finally, the workflows will be integrated into user-friendly tools such as lesSDRF, enabling automated metadata compilation during PRIDE submissions. Retrospective metadata generation will also be applied to existing public datasets with support from PRIDE’s data curation team. Enhanced PRIDE functionality will include metadata-driven dataset querying via the website and API. Outcomes The project will deliver multiple key outcomes: automated workflows for metadata extraction from raw data and open-access publications using NLP; a community challenge to produce open-source metadata extraction solutions; educational resources and tutorials through ProteomicsML; enhanced metadata tools integrated with PRIDE submission workflows; advanced metadata-based querying and API retrieval in PRIDE; and several open-access publications describing methodologies and technical innovations. All workflows and outputs will follow open-science principles, with code released on GitHub and manuscripts preprinted with accompanying data. While initially focused on proteomics, this work will create a scalable template for addressing metadata challenges across omics disciplines, beginning with metabolomics and beyond. Rationale for a Working Group Approach The project combines expertise across bioinformatics, machine learning, NLP, proteomics, and data repository management, exceeding the capacity of any single research group. Machine-learning and NLP specialists will design algorithms to extract metadata from raw files and publications, while bioinformaticians will align metadata with structured data standards. Proteomics experts will ensure biological relevance, and repository teams will oversee integration with PRIDE. This coordinated, interdisciplinary effort enables robust, scalable, and biologically meaningful metadata solutions. Rationale for NCEMS Support The project aligns with NCEMS’s mission to leverage public data for large-scale synthesis and develop novel integrative strategies. NCEMS staff scientists will assist with SDRF metadata curation, community challenge support, and workflow integration. CyVerse computational resources will provide scalability for NLP and large-scale metadata extraction. Team science training, project management support, and coordination of tool integration across geographically distributed members will further enhance outcomes. NCEMS’s contribution ensures both technical infrastructure and sustainability for this collaborative initiative. Requested Resources The project requires staff scientist and assistant support specializing in metadata harmonization and proteomics experimental design. These roles will include curation of metadata, support for NLP corpus creation, management of the community challenge, technical guidance, and workflow integration. Computational resources include approximately 15 TB of storage for public data mirroring, 2,500 CPU hours for metadata extraction pipelines, and 500 GPU hours for local fine-tuning of LLMs. Proposed Timeline The project is planned for two years. The first year will focus on metadata compilation, workflow development, and a community challenge launch. The second year will include evaluation of challenge outcomes, integration of workflows into lesSDRF, retrospective metadata generation for PRIDE datasets, and implementation of metadata-based querying functionality. Final deliverables will include completed tools, datasets, and open-access publications disseminated to the research community.",Accepted,4.0

By combining expertise from biophysics, computational biology, cell biology, and machine learning, we will analyze thousands of proteins across diverse organisms to identify conserved sequence features, post-translational modifications, and structural motifs that drive condensate formation. The project will synthesize data from DisProt, PhaSePro, LLPSDB, and recent proteome-wide studies to map the phase separation landscape across the tree of life. We will develop open-source machine learning models to predict LLPS propensity and validate predictions against existing experimental datasets. This work addresses the fundamental question of how cells evolved to use phase separation as a regulatory mechanism and will provide tools for understanding disease-associated mutations in condensate-forming proteins. The collaborative nature of this project requires integration of disparate data types, advanced computational infrastructure, and expertise spanning multiple disciplines—capabilities that exceed individual laboratories. Deliverables will include a comprehensive phase separation atlas, predictive algorithms with public web interfaces, standardized analysis workflows, and training modules for graduate students in integrative data science approaches to molecular biology.",,"Background And Significance

Biomolecular condensates have revolutionized our understanding of cellular organization, revealing that cells utilize liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to create membraneless compartments that concentrate biomolecules and regulate biochemical reactions. Since the seminal discoveries linking intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to phase separation behavior in P granules and stress granules, the field has exploded with observations of hundreds of condensate-forming proteins involved in diverse cellular processes including transcription, RNA processing, signal transduction, and stress response. Despite this rapid progress, fundamental questions remain unanswered: What are the universal sequence features that encode phase separation propensity? How do post-translational modifications tune condensate properties? Why do certain proteins phase separate while closely related sequences do not? These questions are critical because aberrant phase transitions are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and aging.

Current understanding of LLPS drivers has been largely derived from detailed studies of individual proteins such as FUS, hnRNPA1, and DDX4. These studies have identified key features including low-complexity domains enriched in specific amino acids (particularly glycine, serine, and aromatic residues), prion-like domains, and multivalent interaction motifs. However, this protein-by-protein approach has limitations. First, it provides limited predictive power for identifying novel phase-separating proteins across proteomes. Second, it obscures potential universal principles that govern LLPS across evolutionary timescales. Third, it fails to capture the complex interplay between sequence features, structural context, and cellular environment that determines phase behavior in vivo.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented datasets that remain underutilized. High-throughput screens have identified hundreds of phase-separating proteins in human cells and model organisms. Proteome-wide studies using turbidity assays, optogenetic systems, and imaging approaches have mapped condensate composition under various cellular conditions. Structural biology has provided atomic-resolution insights into condensate-relevant interactions, while AlphaFold has predicted structures for millions of proteins, including disordered regions previously inaccessible to experimental methods. Simultaneously, databases like DisProt, PhaSePro, LLPSDB, and DrLLPS have catalogued experimentally validated phase-separating proteins and their properties. However, these datasets exist in isolation, analyzed within narrow disciplinary boundaries, preventing synthesis that could reveal emergent principles.

The significance of this synthesis project lies in its potential to transform LLPS research from descriptive to predictive science. By integrating diverse data types—sequences, structures, modifications, interaction networks, and experimental phase behavior—across thousands of proteins and multiple organisms, we can identify conserved ""grammatical rules"" that cells use to encode phase separation behavior. This is analogous to how comparative genomics revealed universal principles of gene regulation by analyzing regulatory sequences across species. Such a framework would enable prediction of disease-causing mutations, rational design of synthetic condensates for biotechnology, and understanding of how phase separation evolved as a regulatory mechanism.

This project is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exists in public repositories, having accumulated over the past five years of intensive LLPS research. Second, machine learning methods have matured to handle complex, multi-modal biological data, as demonstrated by successes in protein structure prediction and variant effect prediction. Third, the field has reached a critical juncture where descriptive studies are giving way to mechanistic and predictive frameworks, creating demand for comprehensive synthesis. Finally, the biomedical importance of understanding condensate dysfunction in disease provides urgent motivation for developing predictive tools that can identify pathogenic variants and therapeutic targets.

The collaborative, multidisciplinary nature of this project is essential and exceeds the capacity of individual laboratories. It requires expertise in biophysics to understand phase transition thermodynamics, computational biology to handle large-scale data integration, machine learning to develop predictive models, structural biology to interpret molecular interactions, cell biology to contextualize findings, and evolutionary biology to trace LLPS mechanisms across species. No single laboratory possesses this breadth of expertise or the computational infrastructure needed to process and integrate terabytes of structural, proteomic, and genomic data. This synthesis project exemplifies the community-scale approach needed to address fundamental questions in modern molecular biology.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to decode the universal principles governing protein phase separation.

Research Question 1: What are the conserved sequence features and compositional biases that predict phase separation propensity across the tree of life? We hypothesize that phase-separating proteins share quantifiable sequence signatures beyond simple amino acid composition, including specific k-mer patterns, charge distribution architectures, and spacing of interaction motifs. We predict that machine learning models trained on multi-species datasets will identify universal features present in organisms from bacteria to humans, as well as lineage-specific adaptations. Testing this hypothesis requires comprehensive analysis of experimentally validated phase-separating proteins from LLPSDB, PhaSePro, and DrLLPS databases, encompassing over 3,000 proteins across diverse taxa. We will extract hundreds of sequence features including amino acid composition, disorder propensity, charge patterning (using metrics like kappa and Omega), aromatic residue spacing, prion-like domain scores, and higher-order sequence motifs. Comparative analysis across phylogenetic groups will reveal conserved versus lineage-specific features. We expect to identify a core set of 20-30 features that are universally predictive, with additional organism-specific features reflecting evolutionary adaptations to different cellular environments.

Research Question 2: How do post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate phase separation behavior, and can we predict modification-dependent changes in condensate properties? We hypothesize that PTMs act as molecular switches that tune phase separation by altering charge distribution, introducing steric constraints, or creating/disrupting interaction sites. Specifically, we predict that phosphorylation sites cluster in regions flanking low-complexity domains, that arginine methylation preferentially occurs in RG-rich regions to modulate cation-pi interactions, and that ubiquitination sites correlate with condensate disassembly signals. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate PTM data from PhosphoSitePlus, UniProt, and iPTMnet with phase separation databases, analyzing over 50,000 modification sites on known phase-separating proteins. We will map PTM positions relative to sequence features identified in Question 1, assess enrichment patterns, and correlate modification states with experimentally measured changes in phase behavior from published datasets. Expected outcomes include PTM-aware predictive models that can forecast how specific modifications alter LLPS propensity, with validation against experimental studies showing modification-dependent condensate assembly/disassembly.

Research Question 3: What structural features and interaction modes drive phase separation, and how do predicted structures from AlphaFold inform our understanding of condensate formation? We hypothesize that phase separation depends not only on sequence but on conformational ensembles and transient structural elements that mediate multivalent interactions. We predict that AlphaFold confidence scores in disordered regions correlate with phase separation propensity, that predicted local structural elements (helices, beta-strands) in IDRs serve as interaction interfaces, and that spatial arrangement of folded domains relative to disordered regions influences condensate architecture. Testing requires integrating experimental structures from PDB with AlphaFold predictions for all known phase-separating proteins, analyzing over 200,000 structural models. We will extract features including secondary structure propensity in disordered regions, domain architecture, inter-domain linker properties, surface properties of folded domains, and predicted protein-protein interaction interfaces. Correlation with experimental phase behavior data will reveal structure-function relationships. We expect to demonstrate that structural context significantly improves prediction accuracy beyond sequence-only models, particularly for proteins with complex domain architectures.

Research Question 4: How has phase separation evolved as a regulatory mechanism, and what evolutionary pressures shaped the distribution of LLPS-prone proteins across cellular functions and organisms? We hypothesize that phase separation emerged early in evolution as a mechanism for spatial organization, with subsequent elaboration in eukaryotes coinciding with increased cellular complexity. We predict that prokaryotic phase-separating proteins are enriched in stress response functions, that eukaryotic innovations include nuclear condensates and signaling assemblies, and that LLPS-prone proteins show accelerated evolution in disordered regions while maintaining conserved interaction motifs. Testing requires phylogenetic analysis of phase-separating protein families across 100+ species spanning all domains of life, integrating data from OrthoDB, KEGG, and GO databases. We will trace the evolutionary origins of condensate-forming proteins, analyze functional enrichment patterns across taxa, assess sequence conservation and divergence rates, and correlate LLPS protein abundance with organismal complexity metrics. Expected outcomes include an evolutionary atlas showing when and how different classes of phase-separating proteins emerged, revealing principles of how cells evolved to exploit phase transitions for regulation.

Collectively, these questions will be addressed through an iterative cycle of data integration, feature extraction, model development, and validation against held-out experimental datasets. Success will be measured by predictive accuracy (AUROC > 0.85 for binary LLPS classification), biological interpretability of identified features, and consistency of findings across independent datasets and organisms.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates multiple data types through a systematic workflow organized into five interconnected phases over a 36-month timeline.

Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Harmonization (Months 1-6). We will compile comprehensive datasets from public repositories: (1) Phase separation databases: LLPSDB (>500 experimentally validated proteins), PhaSePro (>1,000 entries with quantitative data), DrLLPS (>300 RNA-binding proteins), and literature-curated datasets from recent proteome-wide screens totaling 3,000+ phase-separating proteins across 50+ species. (2) Sequence databases: UniProt for protein sequences and annotations, Pfam for domain architectures, DisProt for disorder annotations (>2,000 proteins). (3) Structural databases: PDB (>200,000 structures), AlphaFold Database (>200 million predictions), with focus on structures for all known phase-separating proteins. (4) PTM databases: PhosphoSitePlus (>500,000 modification sites), iPTMnet, and UniProt PTM annotations. (5) Functional databases: Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, STRING for interaction networks. (6) Evolutionary databases: OrthoDB for orthology relationships, NCBI Taxonomy for phylogenetic information. Data harmonization will address inconsistencies in protein identifiers, standardize nomenclature, and create unified data structures. We will implement quality control filters, removing low-confidence entries and documenting data provenance. All processed datasets will be version-controlled and deposited in Zenodo with DOIs.

Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Multi-Scale Analysis (Months 4-12). We will extract comprehensive features at multiple scales: (1) Sequence features: amino acid composition, k-mer frequencies (k=2-6), disorder predictions using IUPred2A and PONDR, charge patterning metrics (kappa, Omega, SCD), prion-like domain scores using PLAAC, aromatic residue spacing, hydropathy profiles, and sequence complexity using Shannon entropy. (2) Structural features: secondary structure propensity from AlphaFold predictions, pLDDT scores as disorder proxies, solvent-accessible surface area, domain-domain interfaces, linker region properties, and predicted binding sites using AlphaFold-Multimer. (3) PTM features: modification site density, PTM type distributions, position relative to disorder/order transitions, and evolutionary conservation of modification sites. (4) Network features: protein-protein interaction degree, condensate co-localization from BioGRID and STRING, and functional module membership. (5) Evolutionary features: sequence conservation scores using ConSurf, ortholog presence/absence patterns, and domain gain/loss events. Feature extraction pipelines will be implemented in Python using BioPython, MDAnalysis, and custom scripts, processing >10,000 proteins with full feature sets. Statistical analysis will identify feature correlations and reduce dimensionality using PCA and UMAP.

Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development (Months 10-24). We will develop multiple complementary models: (1) Binary classification models to predict LLPS propensity using gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), random forests, and deep neural networks. Training will use 80% of data with 5-fold cross-validation, testing on held-out 20%. (2) Multi-class models to predict condensate types (nuclear bodies, stress granules, P-bodies, etc.) using the same algorithms. (3) Regression models to predict quantitative properties (critical concentration, saturation concentration) where data exists. (4) Sequence-to-function models using transformer architectures (ProtBERT, ESM-2) fine-tuned on LLPS data to capture long-range sequence dependencies. (5) Ensemble models combining predictions from multiple algorithms. Model interpretation will use SHAP values to identify important features, attention visualization for transformers, and ablation studies. We will specifically test whether models trained on one organism generalize to others, assessing cross-species transferability. PTM-aware models will incorporate modification states as conditional inputs. Validation will use multiple metrics: AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, precision, recall, and Matthews correlation coefficient. We will benchmark against existing tools (catGRANULE, PSPredictor, FuzDrop) using identical test sets.

Phase 4: Evolutionary and Comparative Analysis (Months 18-30). Phylogenetic analysis will trace LLPS protein evolution across 100+ species spanning bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We will construct phylogenetic trees for condensate-forming protein families using MAFFT alignment and RAxML/IQ-TREE. Ancestral sequence reconstruction using PAML will infer evolutionary trajectories of LLPS-relevant features. Functional enrichment analysis using GO and KEGG will identify lineage-specific adaptations. We will calculate dN/dS ratios to assess selection pressures on disordered versus ordered regions. Correlation analysis will test relationships between organismal complexity (genome size, cell type number, proteome size) and LLPS protein abundance. Network analysis will examine how phase-separating proteins integrate into cellular pathways across species. This analysis will generate an evolutionary atlas visualizing the emergence and diversification of phase separation mechanisms.

Phase 5: Tool Development and Validation (Months 24-36). We will develop user-friendly tools: (1) Web server for LLPS prediction accepting protein sequences, providing propensity scores, confidence intervals, and feature importance visualizations. (2) PTM effect predictor for assessing how modifications alter phase behavior. (3) Mutation effect predictor for disease variant interpretation. (4) Interactive phase separation atlas with searchable database and visualization tools. All tools will have REST APIs for programmatic access. We will create standardized analysis workflows using Snakemake and containerize using Docker for reproducibility. Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and Jupyter notebooks will be provided. Validation will include prospective testing on recently published LLPS proteins not in training data, and community feedback through beta testing with 10+ external laboratories.

Computational Infrastructure: Analysis will use high-performance computing resources including GPU clusters for deep learning (NVIDIA A100s), distributed computing for large-scale feature extraction, and cloud storage for data management. We will use version control (GitHub), project management tools (Slack, Asana), and regular virtual meetings for team coordination.

Timeline Milestones: Month 6: Complete data harmonization; Month 12: Feature extraction complete, initial models trained; Month 18: Best-performing models identified, cross-species validation complete; Month 24: Evolutionary analysis complete, web tools in beta; Month 30: All tools publicly released, manuscripts submitted; Month 36: Training materials complete, final reports delivered.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

Our methods for incorporating structural predictions from AlphaFold into functional analysis will demonstrate how AI-predicted structures can generate biological insights beyond structure determination itself.

Biomedical Impact: Understanding phase separation has direct implications for human health. Aberrant condensate formation drives neurodegenerative diseases (ALS, Alzheimer's, Huntington's), cancer, and viral infections. Our mutation effect predictors will enable clinical interpretation of variants in condensate-forming proteins, supporting precision medicine efforts. The tools will help identify therapeutic targets—proteins whose phase behavior could be pharmacologically modulated. We will specifically analyze disease-associated mutations in FUS, TDP-43, hnRNPA1, and other proteins, providing mechanistic insights into pathogenesis. This work will inform drug discovery efforts targeting condensate assembly/disassembly.

Biotechnology Applications: Synthetic biology increasingly exploits phase separation for applications including biosensors, metabolic engineering, and cellular reprogramming. Our predictive tools will enable rational design of synthetic condensates with desired properties, accelerating development of biomolecular technologies. The ability to predict how sequence changes affect phase behavior will support protein engineering efforts.

(2) Preprints on bioRxiv for rapid community access. (3) Presentations at major conferences (Biophysical Society, ASCB, ISMB, Gordon Conferences). (4) Social media engagement through Twitter threads, blog posts, and video abstracts. (5) Press releases for major findings. (6) Direct engagement with disease foundations and patient advocacy groups for biomedical findings.

Open Science Commitment: All data, code, models, and workflows will be publicly available from project initiation. We will use GitHub for code (MIT license), Zenodo for datasets (CC-BY), and established repositories (PDB, UniProt) for depositing curated data. Analysis workflows will be fully documented and containerized for reproducibility. We will adopt FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for all outputs. Monthly progress reports will be posted publicly. We will engage the community through advisory board meetings and solicit feedback on tool development.

Long-term Sustainability: Beyond the funding period, the project will be sustained through: (1) Integration of tools into established platforms (e.g., UniProt, PDB) ensuring long-term maintenance. (2) Community governance model where users contribute data and improvements. (3) Follow-up funding applications to expand scope and update models as new data emerges. (4) Partnerships with industry for biotechnology applications. (5) Educational licensing generating modest revenue for server maintenance.

Broader Impacts: This project exemplifies how synthesis research can extract maximum value from public data investments, demonstrating the power of collaborative, open science. It will catalyze new collaborations across disciplines and institutions, creating a network of researchers working on phase separation. The success will encourage similar synthesis efforts in other areas of molecular biology, advancing the field toward more integrative, predictive science. Ultimately, this work will transform how we understand cellular organization and provide practical tools for addressing human disease.

This synthesis project will integrate metabolomics databases (KEGG, MetaCyc, HMDB), genomic data across all domains of life, geochemical datasets, and prebiotic chemistry literature to reconstruct plausible evolutionary pathways of metabolic network assembly. By bringing together systems biologists, evolutionary biochemists, geochemists, and network theorists, we will analyze the distribution of metabolic pathways across phylogenetic space to identify ancient core reactions and trace their elaboration into complex networks. The project will synthesize data from thousands of sequenced genomes, experimental studies of enzyme promiscuity, and computational models of prebiotic reaction networks to test competing hypotheses about metabolic origins (RNA world, metabolism-first, iron-sulfur world). We will employ graph theory, phylogenetic reconstruction, and constraint-based modeling to identify metabolic modules that could have functioned in early cells and map their expansion through gene duplication, horizontal transfer, and pathway fusion. This work will address whether metabolism evolved through continuous elaboration or punctuated innovation and identify chemical constraints that shaped biochemical evolution. The synthesis requires integration of geological, chemical, and biological data at scales impossible for single laboratories, along with development of novel analytical frameworks. Outputs will include an evolutionary metabolic atlas, open-source reconstruction tools, curated databases of ancient enzyme families, and interdisciplinary training programs bridging chemistry, biology, and computational sciences.",,"Background And Significance

The origin of metabolism represents one of the most profound unsolved questions in biology, bridging chemistry, biology, and Earth sciences. Modern cellular metabolism comprises thousands of interconnected biochemical reactions catalyzed by highly specific enzymes, yet this complexity must have emerged from simpler prebiotic chemistry operating on the early Earth approximately 3.8-4.0 billion years ago. Understanding this transition is critical not only for reconstructing life's origins but also for comprehending fundamental principles governing biochemical organization, evolutionary innovation, and the chemical constraints that shape biological systems.

Current research on metabolic origins remains fragmented across multiple disciplines. Geochemists have characterized the chemical composition of early Earth environments, identifying plausible prebiotic reaction conditions including hydrothermal vents, alkaline springs, and atmospheric chemistry. Prebiotic chemists have demonstrated that many metabolic intermediates can form abiotically under these conditions, with notable examples including the non-enzymatic synthesis of components of the reverse citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. However, these experimental studies typically focus on isolated reactions rather than integrated networks. Meanwhile, comparative genomics has revealed the distribution of metabolic genes across the tree of life, enabling inference of ancestral metabolic capabilities through phylogenetic reconstruction. Systems biology has developed sophisticated network analysis tools to understand metabolic organization, identifying modules, hubs, and hierarchical structures. Yet these approaches have rarely been integrated to address the fundamental question of how metabolism evolved.

Several competing hypotheses attempt to explain metabolic origins. The metabolism-first hypothesis proposes that self-sustaining networks of chemical reactions preceded genetic information systems, with early metabolism driven by mineral catalysts or simple organic catalysts. The RNA world hypothesis suggests that ribozymes catalyzed early metabolism before protein enzymes evolved. The iron-sulfur world theory emphasizes the role of metal sulfide minerals in catalyzing primordial carbon fixation reactions. Each hypothesis makes distinct predictions about which metabolic pathways are most ancient, the chemical environments that supported early metabolism, and the sequence of pathway assembly. However, rigorous testing of these hypotheses requires synthesis of diverse data types that no single laboratory possesses the expertise or resources to integrate.

Recent advances make this synthesis project timely and feasible. First, the explosion of genomic sequencing has provided metabolic gene data from over 200,000 organisms spanning all domains of life, including representatives from deep-branching lineages that retain signatures of ancient metabolism. Second, comprehensive metabolic databases (KEGG, MetaCyc, BRENDA, HMDB) now catalog thousands of characterized reactions, enzymes, and pathways with standardized annotations. Third, experimental studies have systematically characterized enzyme promiscuity—the ability of enzymes to catalyze alternative reactions—revealing how new metabolic functions can emerge. Fourth, computational advances in network analysis, phylogenetic reconstruction, and constraint-based modeling enable sophisticated analysis of metabolic evolution at unprecedented scales. Fifth, geochemical databases now provide detailed constraints on early Earth chemistry, including ocean composition, atmospheric gases, and hydrothermal fluid chemistry.

Despite these resources, critical gaps remain. We lack systematic integration of phylogenetic distributions of metabolic pathways with geochemical constraints and prebiotic chemistry data. The relative antiquity of major metabolic modules remains contentious, with conflicting phylogenetic signals complicated by horizontal gene transfer, gene loss, and convergent evolution. The chemical feasibility of proposed ancestral pathways under realistic prebiotic conditions has not been systematically evaluated. Network-level principles governing metabolic expansion—whether through gradual elaboration or punctuated innovation—remain unclear. Most critically, no comprehensive framework exists for synthesizing geological, chemical, genomic, and systems-level data to reconstruct metabolic evolution.

This project addresses these gaps through unprecedented data synthesis and methodological innovation. By integrating multiple data types and analytical approaches, we will reconstruct plausible evolutionary trajectories of metabolic network assembly, test competing origin hypotheses, and identify fundamental principles of biochemical evolution. This work is significant because it will provide the first comprehensive, data-driven reconstruction of metabolic origins, establish new frameworks for evolutionary systems biology, and train a new generation of scientists capable of bridging chemistry, biology, and computational sciences. The insights gained will inform synthetic biology efforts to design minimal metabolic systems, astrobiology searches for biosignatures on other worlds, and fundamental understanding of how complex biological organization emerges from chemical principles.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes.

Research Question 1: Which metabolic pathways and reactions represent the ancient core of metabolism that was present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and potentially earlier protocells? We hypothesize that ancient core metabolism comprises a relatively small set of reactions (100-300) that are: (a) universally or nearly universally distributed across phylogenetically diverse organisms, (b) catalyzed by enzymes with deep phylogenetic roots and simple structural folds, (c) chemically feasible under plausible prebiotic conditions, and (d) organized into autocatalytic or self-amplifying network motifs. We predict that this ancient core will be enriched for reactions involving small molecules (C1-C6 compounds), simple cofactors (metal ions, thioesters), and central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, reverse citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA pathway). To test this hypothesis, we will integrate phylogenetic distribution data from genomic databases with enzyme age estimates from molecular clock analyses and structural biology data on protein fold antiquity. We will cross-validate candidates for ancient reactions by assessing their chemical feasibility using thermodynamic databases and published prebiotic chemistry experiments. Expected outcomes include a curated catalog of 100-300 high-confidence ancient reactions with supporting evidence scores, phylogenetic trees for ancient enzyme families, and network maps showing their interconnections.

Research Question 2: What were the dominant mechanisms of metabolic network expansion from the ancient core to modern complexity? We hypothesize that metabolic expansion occurred through distinct, identifiable mechanisms including: (a) gene duplication followed by functional divergence (neofunctionalization), (b) horizontal gene transfer enabling acquisition of novel pathways, (c) enzyme promiscuity providing substrate for selection of new functions, (d) pathway fusion creating new metabolic routes, and (e) recruitment of enzymes from non-metabolic functions. We predict that different metabolic subsystems expanded through different dominant mechanisms, with central metabolism showing more gene duplication and peripheral metabolism showing more horizontal transfer. We will test this by analyzing phylogenetic patterns of enzyme families, identifying duplication events and transfer events using reconciliation methods, and correlating expansion patterns with network topology metrics. We will quantify the relative contribution of each mechanism across different metabolic domains (amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, lipid metabolism, etc.) and across different lineages. Expected outcomes include quantitative estimates of mechanism contributions, identification of key innovation events in metabolic history, and network growth models parameterized by empirical data.

Research Question 3: Does metabolic evolution exhibit continuous gradual elaboration or punctuated episodes of rapid innovation? We hypothesize that metabolic evolution shows punctuated dynamics, with rapid expansion periods corresponding to: (a) major evolutionary transitions (origin of life, origin of photosynthesis, origin of eukaryotes), (b) environmental changes (Great Oxidation Event, Snowball Earth episodes), and (c) ecological innovations (colonization of new niches). We predict that network analysis will reveal distinct metabolic layers corresponding to different evolutionary epochs, with ancient core reactions showing high centrality and connectivity, and peripheral reactions showing signatures of recent innovation. To test this, we will perform temporal stratification of metabolic networks using molecular clock dating of enzyme families, correlate expansion events with geological and environmental data, and analyze network topology evolution over time. We will employ graph theory metrics (betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients, modularity) to characterize network structure at different evolutionary time points. Expected outcomes include a temporal atlas of metabolic network assembly, identification of major innovation episodes with geological correlates, and quantitative models of network growth dynamics.

Research Question 4: What chemical and physical constraints shaped the evolutionary trajectory of metabolism? We hypothesize that metabolic evolution was constrained by: (a) thermodynamic favorability of reactions under prevailing environmental conditions, (b) availability of chemical elements and cofactors, (c) catalytic mechanisms accessible to simple catalysts (minerals, small molecules, early peptides), and (d) network-level requirements for autocatalysis and robustness. We predict that ancient reactions will show greater thermodynamic favorability under early Earth conditions (anoxic, reduced, metal-rich environments) compared to modern conditions, and that pathway architectures will reflect optimization for robustness against environmental perturbations. To test this, we will integrate geochemical data on early Earth conditions with thermodynamic calculations for metabolic reactions, assess cofactor requirements against availability constraints, and perform computational simulations of proto-metabolic networks under varying environmental conditions. We will use constraint-based modeling (flux balance analysis) to evaluate which combinations of reactions could support cellular functions under different chemical scenarios. Expected outcomes include thermodynamic feasibility maps for ancient reactions, identification of critical chemical constraints that channeled metabolic evolution, and computational models of minimal viable proto-metabolic networks.

Across all research questions, we will validate findings through multiple independent lines of evidence, assess robustness to methodological choices and parameter values, and quantify uncertainty in inferences. All hypotheses generate specific, testable predictions that can be evaluated against synthesized data, and all analyses will be conducted with transparent, reproducible workflows following open science principles.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse data sources through a multi-phase analytical workflow, employing cutting-edge computational methods and fostering intensive collaboration among team members with complementary expertise.

Data Sources and Integration: We will compile and integrate five major data categories. (1) Metabolic pathway databases: KEGG (11,000+ organisms, 500+ pathways), MetaCyc (3,000+ pathways from 3,000+ organisms), BRENDA (enzyme kinetics and specificity), HMDB (human metabolites), and Reactome (pathway annotations). (2) Genomic and phylogenetic data: Complete genomes from NCBI RefSeq (200,000+ organisms), focusing on phylogenetically diverse representatives including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes with emphasis on deep-branching lineages. We will extract metabolic gene annotations using KEGG Orthology, COG, and Pfam databases. (3) Protein structural data: Protein Data Bank structures for metabolic enzymes, SCOP/CATH fold classifications, and AlphaFold predictions for ancient enzyme families to assess structural antiquity. (4) Geochemical data: Early Earth environmental parameters from published compilations including ocean chemistry, atmospheric composition, hydrothermal vent fluid chemistry, and mineral availability across geological time. (5) Prebiotic chemistry literature: Systematic literature mining (5,000+ papers) documenting abiotic synthesis of metabolic compounds and non-enzymatic catalysis of metabolic reactions. All data will be standardized using common identifiers (InChI for compounds, EC numbers for reactions, UniProt for proteins) and stored in a unified graph database enabling complex queries across data types.

Phase 1 (Months 1-8): Ancient Core Metabolism Identification. We will employ phylogenetic profiling to identify metabolic reactions present across phylogenetically diverse organisms, calculating phylogenetic distribution scores for each reaction in KEGG/MetaCyc. For enzymes catalyzing candidate ancient reactions, we will reconstruct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood methods (IQ-TREE, RAxML) with rigorous model selection and bootstrap support assessment. We will perform molecular clock dating using RelTime and BEAST2 to estimate enzyme family ages, calibrating with established divergence times. Protein structural analysis will assess fold antiquity using established criteria (small size, high stability, simple topology). We will calculate thermodynamic feasibility for candidate ancient reactions using group contribution methods and published thermodynamic databases (eQuilibrator), evaluating ΔG values under plausible early Earth conditions (pH 5-9, temperature 25-100°C, varying redox potentials). Network analysis will identify autocatalytic motifs and self-amplifying cycles using graph algorithms. Integration of these multiple lines of evidence will produce a scored catalog of ancient reactions, with confidence levels based on agreement across methods.

Phase 2 (Months 9-16): Metabolic Network Expansion Analysis. We will analyze mechanisms of metabolic expansion through phylogenomic approaches. Gene duplication events will be identified using gene tree-species tree reconciliation (NOTUNG, GeneRax), quantifying duplication rates across enzyme families and metabolic domains. Horizontal gene transfer events will be detected using phylogenetic incongruence methods and parametric approaches (ALE, AnGST), with validation through compositional analysis. Enzyme promiscuity data will be compiled from literature and BRENDA, analyzing relationships between primary and promiscuous activities to infer evolutionary trajectories. Pathway fusion events will be identified by detecting chimeric pathways sharing components with distinct phylogenetic histories. We will construct time-resolved metabolic networks by layering reactions according to estimated ages, analyzing network topology evolution using graph theory metrics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, modularity). Comparative analysis across lineages will identify lineage-specific innovations and universal expansion patterns. Statistical modeling will quantify relative contributions of different expansion mechanisms using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.

Phase 3 (Months 17-24): Evolutionary Dynamics and Constraint Analysis. We will test punctuated versus gradual evolution models by analyzing temporal distributions of enzyme family origins using molecular clock data, employing change-point detection algorithms to identify rapid expansion episodes. Correlation analysis will relate expansion events to geological/environmental changes using time-series methods with appropriate corrections for temporal autocorrelation. We will assess chemical constraints by calculating thermodynamic favorability of reactions under time-varying environmental conditions, using geochemical models of ocean and atmosphere evolution. Cofactor requirement analysis will evaluate whether ancient reactions preferentially use cofactors available on early Earth (Fe, Ni, S, simple organics) versus modern cofactors (complex coenzymes). Constraint-based modeling using flux balance analysis will evaluate functional viability of reconstructed proto-metabolic networks, testing whether subsets of ancient reactions can support basic cellular functions (energy generation, biosynthesis of building blocks). We will perform sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of conclusions to parameter uncertainty and methodological choices.

Phase 4 (Months 25-30): Integration, Validation, and Tool Development. We will integrate findings across phases to construct comprehensive evolutionary scenarios for metabolic origins and expansion. Alternative scenarios will be evaluated using Bayesian model comparison, assessing support for competing hypotheses (metabolism-first, RNA world, iron-sulfur world). Cross-validation will be performed using held-out data and independent test sets. We will develop open-source software tools including: (1) MetaboEvo database with curated ancient enzyme families and reactions, (2) network visualization tools for exploring evolutionary metabolic atlas, (3) analysis pipelines for phylogenetic profiling and network reconstruction, and (4) educational modules for training. All code will be version-controlled (GitHub), containerized (Docker), and documented with tutorials.

Timeline and Milestones: Months 1-8: Data compilation complete, ancient core metabolism catalog (100-300 reactions) published as preprint. Months 9-16: Expansion mechanism analysis complete, network growth models published. Months 17-24: Evolutionary dynamics analysis complete, constraint analysis published. Months 25-30: Integration complete, evolutionary metabolic atlas released, final synthesis papers submitted, tools publicly available. The team will meet monthly via videoconference and hold two in-person workshops (months 10 and 24) for intensive collaboration. Quarterly progress reports will be shared with NCEMS and posted publicly.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes with broad impacts across multiple scientific disciplines and training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

Primary Scientific Outcomes: The project will produce the first comprehensive, data-driven reconstruction of metabolic evolution from prebiotic chemistry to modern cellular metabolism. The Evolutionary Metabolic Atlas will provide an interactive, publicly accessible resource mapping the temporal assembly of metabolic networks, with reactions and pathways annotated by estimated age, phylogenetic distribution, chemical feasibility, and supporting evidence. This atlas will include approximately 100-300 high-confidence ancient reactions forming the metabolic core, temporal stratification of 3,000+ modern pathways, and quantitative models of network expansion dynamics. We will publish a curated database of ancient enzyme families (estimated 200-400 families) with phylogenetic trees, structural information, and functional annotations, serving as a reference for evolutionary biochemistry research. Quantitative estimates of expansion mechanism contributions will reveal how gene duplication, horizontal transfer, enzyme promiscuity, and other processes shaped metabolic evolution, with mechanism-specific rates calculated for different metabolic domains and lineages. Our analysis of evolutionary dynamics will definitively test whether metabolism evolved gradually or through punctuated innovation, identifying major expansion episodes and their geological/environmental correlates. Chemical constraint analysis will reveal fundamental principles governing biochemical evolution, including thermodynamic channeling effects, cofactor availability constraints, and network-level requirements for autocatalysis and robustness.

Methodological Innovations: The project will establish new analytical frameworks for evolutionary systems biology, integrating phylogenomics, network analysis, thermodynamics, and geochemistry in unprecedented ways. We will develop and validate novel methods for temporal stratification of metabolic networks, combining molecular clock dating with network topology analysis. Our constraint-based modeling approaches for proto-metabolic networks will provide new tools for assessing functional viability of hypothetical ancestral metabolisms. The integration framework itself—spanning geological, chemical, genomic, and systems-level data—will serve as a model for future synthesis projects addressing other aspects of early evolution. All methods will be implemented in open-source software with comprehensive documentation, enabling other researchers to apply these approaches to related questions.

Broader Scientific Impacts: This work will fundamentally advance understanding of life's origins, providing rigorous tests of competing hypotheses about metabolic origins and establishing empirical constraints on scenarios for the emergence of cellular life. The insights will inform synthetic biology efforts to design minimal metabolic systems, potentially enabling construction of artificial cells with simplified metabolism based on ancient core reactions. Astrobiology will benefit from identification of metabolic biosignatures most likely to be universal across life forms, guiding searches for life on other worlds. The chemical constraints identified will inform understanding of biochemical possibility space and the extent to which Earth's biochemistry is contingent versus inevitable. Evolutionary biology more broadly will gain insights into mechanisms of biochemical innovation applicable beyond metabolism. Systems biology will benefit from network-level principles of metabolic organization and evolution. The interdisciplinary approaches developed will serve as models for addressing other complex questions requiring synthesis across traditional disciplinary boundaries.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train 6-8 graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research, providing expertise spanning computational biology, evolutionary biochemistry, geochemistry, and network science. Trainees will gain skills in large-scale data integration, phylogenetic analysis, network modeling, and collaborative team science. We will develop and disseminate educational modules including: (1) online tutorials for metabolic network analysis and evolutionary reconstruction, (2) workshop curricula for training in synthesis research methods, (3) case studies for teaching origins of life and evolutionary biochemistry, and (4) datasets and exercises for computational biology courses. These materials will be freely available and designed for diverse audiences from undergraduate to professional researchers. The project will particularly emphasize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with minority-serving institutions and professional societies promoting diversity in science.

Dissemination and Open Science: All findings will be disseminated through multiple channels following open science principles. We will publish 8-12 peer-reviewed papers in high-impact journals spanning molecular biology, evolution, systems biology, and origins of life research, with all papers made open access. Preprints will be posted immediately upon completion. The Evolutionary Metabolic Atlas will be released as a public web resource with interactive visualization tools, downloadable datasets, and API access. All analysis code will be deposited in GitHub repositories with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. Curated databases will be submitted to established repositories (e.g., Zenodo) with persistent identifiers. We will present findings at major conferences (ISMB, SMBE, Origins of Life Gordon Conference, Astrobiology Science Conference) and organize symposia bringing together diverse researchers. Public outreach will include popular science articles, blog posts, and social media engagement explaining the work's significance. We will engage with science journalists to ensure accurate reporting of findings.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project will establish a foundation for ongoing research on metabolic evolution and origins of life. The databases, tools, and analytical frameworks developed will continue to be valuable as new genomic data becomes available and geochemical understanding advances. We will seek additional funding to expand the work to other aspects of early cellular evolution (genetic systems, membrane biogenesis, regulatory networks) and to maintain and update resources. The collaborative network established will persist beyond the project period, fostering continued interdisciplinary research. The training programs will create a cohort of scientists equipped to pursue synthesis research throughout their careers, multiplying the project's long-term impact. Ultimately, this work will help establish evolutionary systems biology as a mature discipline with rigorous methods for reconstructing the deep history of cellular life.

Justification for NCEMS Support: This synthesis project absolutely requires NCEMS support and cannot be accomplished by individual laboratories or existing collaborations. The project demands integration of expertise spanning molecular biology, evolutionary biology, geochemistry, network science, and computational biology—a combination not present in any single research group. The scale of data integration (200,000+ genomes, 3,000+ pathways, thousands of geochemical measurements, 5,000+ prebiotic chemistry papers) requires dedicated personnel and computational infrastructure beyond typical lab resources. The collaborative infrastructure needed—regular meetings, coordination mechanisms, shared computational platforms—requires dedicated support. Most critically, the synthesis approach itself—integrating geological, chemical, and biological data to address fundamental questions about life's origins—represents a new paradigm requiring seed funding to establish methods and demonstrate feasibility. NCEMS support will catalyze formation of a collaborative network that will persist beyond the funding period and establish evolutionary systems biology as a rigorous discipline for addressing deep questions about cellular evolution.",,
ai_generate_ideas_no_role_claude_03,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,claude-sonnet-4-5,The Hidden Regulatory Layer: Systematic Discovery of Functional RNA Structures Across the Transcriptome,"While RNA structure is fundamental to gene regulation, most transcriptome-wide structural information remains unexplored. This synthesis project will integrate publicly available RNA structure probing data (DMS-seq, SHAPE-seq, icSHAPE), evolutionary conservation data, ribosome profiling datasets, and RNA-binding protein interaction maps to systematically identify functional RNA structural elements across human and model organism transcriptomes. By assembling experts in RNA biology, structural bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and machine learning, we will analyze thousands of datasets to discover conserved structural motifs that regulate translation, localization, and stability. The project will synthesize data from ENCODE, GTEx, modENCODE, and specialized RNA structure databases to build comprehensive structure-function maps. We will develop algorithms to distinguish functional structures from neutral folding, identify structure-disrupting disease mutations, and predict how RNA modifications alter structural landscapes. This addresses the fundamental question of how much gene regulation occurs through RNA structure versus sequence alone. The collaborative framework is essential because it requires integration of chemical probing data, high-throughput sequencing, structural prediction algorithms, and functional genomics—expertise rarely combined in single laboratories. The project will produce a public RNA structure atlas, validated structural motif libraries, prediction tools for identifying regulatory structures, and training workshops in integrative RNA biology. This resource will transform understanding of post-transcriptional regulation and provide new therapeutic targets for RNA-based diseases.",,"Background And Significance

RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional structures that are critical for their biological functions. While the importance of RNA structure has been recognized since the discovery of tRNA and ribosomal RNA, the systematic exploration of structural elements across entire transcriptomes has only recently become feasible through high-throughput chemical probing technologies. Despite revolutionary advances in RNA structure probing methods over the past decade, including DMS-seq, SHAPE-seq, and icSHAPE, the vast majority of structural data generated remains underutilized in isolated repositories. The central challenge facing the field is not data scarcity but rather the lack of systematic integration and synthesis of existing datasets to extract biological insights about functional RNA structures.

Recent studies have demonstrated that RNA secondary structures in untranslated regions (UTRs) regulate translation efficiency, mRNA stability, and subcellular localization. For instance, structured elements in 5' UTRs can modulate ribosome scanning and translation initiation, while 3' UTR structures influence mRNA decay rates and microRNA accessibility. The discovery of riboswitches in bacteria and their functional analogs in eukaryotes has highlighted how RNA structures can serve as molecular sensors responding to cellular conditions. Furthermore, RNA modifications such as m6A have been shown to alter local RNA structure, creating a dynamic regulatory landscape that responds to developmental and environmental cues. However, these discoveries have emerged from focused studies on individual transcripts or small gene sets, leaving the transcriptome-wide landscape of functional RNA structures largely uncharted.

The ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have generated extensive RNA structure probing data across multiple cell types and organisms, complemented by ribosome profiling data that reveals translation dynamics and eCLIP data mapping RNA-binding protein interactions. The GTEx project provides tissue-specific expression and genetic variation data across human populations. Specialized databases like RMBase catalog RNA modifications, while comparative genomics resources offer evolutionary conservation information across hundreds of species. Despite this wealth of publicly available data, no systematic effort has integrated these diverse data types to comprehensively identify and characterize functional RNA structural elements. Individual laboratories lack the multidisciplinary expertise and computational resources required to synthesize these heterogeneous datasets effectively.

Several critical gaps limit our understanding of RNA structure-function relationships. First, we cannot reliably distinguish functional RNA structures under selective pressure from thermodynamically stable but biologically neutral structures. Second, the relationship between sequence conservation and structural conservation remains poorly understood—many functionally important structures may be maintained through compensatory mutations that preserve structure while altering sequence. Third, the impact of genetic variants on RNA structure and their contribution to disease phenotypes is largely unexplored, despite growing evidence that structure-disrupting mutations can cause pathology. Fourth, how RNA modifications dynamically remodel structural landscapes to regulate gene expression remains unclear. Finally, we lack comprehensive catalogs of structural motifs analogous to the transcription factor binding site databases that have proven invaluable for understanding transcriptional regulation.

This research is timely for several reasons. First, the accumulation of diverse RNA structure datasets has reached a critical mass enabling meaningful synthesis. Second, advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning approaches for sequence-structure relationships, provide powerful new analytical tools. Third, the recent success of RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines has intensified interest in understanding RNA structure for drug design. Fourth, the recognition that many disease-associated genetic variants occur in non-coding regions necessitates understanding structural regulatory mechanisms. Finally, the field is transitioning from studying individual RNA structures to systems-level approaches, creating demand for comprehensive resources and analytical frameworks. By synthesizing existing data through collaborative, multidisciplinary analysis, this project will address fundamental questions about the prevalence, conservation, and functional importance of RNA structures in gene regulation, providing a foundation for understanding post-transcriptional control mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic opportunities.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that require integration of diverse datasets and analytical approaches beyond the capacity of individual laboratories.

Research Question 1: What is the transcriptome-wide landscape of functionally constrained RNA structures, and how do they differ from thermodynamically stable but neutral structures? We hypothesize that functionally important RNA structures exhibit distinctive signatures combining evolutionary conservation at the structural level (maintained through compensatory mutations), consistent chemical probing patterns across cell types and conditions, and associations with regulatory outcomes such as altered translation efficiency or mRNA stability. We predict that approximately 15-25% of structured regions in UTRs and long non-coding RNAs are under functional constraint, based on preliminary analyses suggesting that most stable structures lack evolutionary conservation signatures. To test this hypothesis, we will develop a machine learning classifier integrating structural probing data, evolutionary conservation metrics calculated from multi-species alignments, ribosome profiling data indicating translational regulation, and RNA-binding protein interaction data. We will validate predictions by examining whether computationally identified functional structures are enriched for disease-associated variants and whether they show consistent structural patterns across independent datasets from different laboratories and experimental conditions.

Research Question 2: How do conserved structural motifs regulate specific molecular processes including translation initiation, mRNA localization, and decay? We hypothesize that distinct structural motif classes correspond to specific regulatory functions, analogous to how transcription factor binding motifs confer specific regulatory logic. We predict that translation-regulatory structures will be enriched in 5' UTRs and show strong correlations with ribosome profiling data, localization-regulatory structures will appear in 3' UTRs of transcripts with tissue-specific expression patterns, and stability-regulatory structures will correlate with mRNA half-life measurements. We will test these hypotheses by performing unsupervised clustering of structural motifs identified across the transcriptome, then systematically associating each motif class with functional genomics data including ribosome profiling (translation), RNA-seq from subcellular fractions (localization), and metabolic labeling experiments (stability). We will examine whether motifs show cell-type-specific functionality by integrating data from diverse cellular contexts available in ENCODE and GTEx. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive catalog of structural motif families with annotated regulatory functions, analogous to transcription factor motif databases but for post-transcriptional regulation.

Research Question 3: What is the impact of genetic variation on RNA structure, and how do structure-disrupting variants contribute to disease phenotypes? We hypothesize that variants disrupting functionally important RNA structures are under negative selection in human populations and are enriched among disease-associated variants, particularly for non-coding variants whose mechanisms remain unclear. We predict that structure-disrupting variants will show reduced allele frequencies in gnomAD population data compared to structure-neutral variants, and that rare structure-disrupting variants will be enriched in ClinVar pathogenic variants and GWAS-identified disease-associated loci. To test this, we will computationally predict structural impacts of all common and rare variants in UTRs and non-coding RNAs using both thermodynamic modeling and machine learning approaches trained on experimental structure data. We will calculate selection coefficients by comparing observed versus expected allele frequencies for structure-disrupting variants across different functional constraint categories. We will perform enrichment analyses examining whether structure-disrupting variants are overrepresented among disease-associated variants while controlling for local mutation rates and other confounding factors. Expected deliverables include genome-wide maps of structure-disrupting variants with predicted functional impacts and prioritized candidate variants for experimental validation by the broader research community.

Research Question 4: How do RNA modifications reshape structural landscapes to modulate gene regulation dynamically? We hypothesize that RNA modifications such as m6A, pseudouridine, and 2'-O-methylation alter local RNA structure in functionally important regions, creating condition-dependent regulatory switches. We predict that modification sites will be enriched in regions showing structural variability across conditions and that modifications will preferentially destabilize structures that otherwise would inhibit regulatory protein binding or ribosome access. To test this, we will integrate RNA modification maps from multiple technologies (m6A-seq, pseudouridine-seq, Nm-seq) with structure probing data from the same cell types and conditions. We will develop computational models predicting how specific modifications alter local structure based on training data where both modified and unmodified structures have been measured. We will examine whether modification-induced structural changes correlate with changes in translation efficiency, RNA-binding protein occupancy, or mRNA stability. Expected outcomes include predictive models for modification-structure relationships and identification of modification-dependent structural switches that regulate gene expression in response to cellular signals. These four research questions are interconnected and will be addressed through iterative analyses, with findings from each question informing and refining approaches to others, exemplifying the synthesis approach central to this project.

Methods And Approach

Our methodological approach integrates diverse data types through a phased analytical strategy, leveraging complementary expertise from team members in RNA biology, computational biology, evolutionary genomics, and machine learning.

Data Sources and Integration (Months 1-6): We will systematically compile and standardize publicly available datasets from multiple repositories. RNA structure probing data will be obtained from ENCODE (>500 DMS-seq and SHAPE-seq datasets across human cell types), modENCODE (Drosophila and C. elegans structure data), Gene Expression Omnibus (>200 icSHAPE and Structure-seq datasets), and specialized databases including RNAStructuromeDB and ArchiveII. Ribosome profiling data will be compiled from GWIPS-viz (>300 datasets) and supplemented with datasets from published studies. RNA-binding protein interaction data will be obtained from ENCODE eCLIP experiments (>200 proteins) and POSTAR database. RNA modification data will be compiled from RMBase 3.0, covering m6A, pseudouridine, and other modifications across multiple cell types. Evolutionary conservation data will be derived from UCSC 100-way vertebrate alignments for human sequences and corresponding alignments for model organisms. Genetic variation data will be obtained from gnomAD (population variants), ClinVar (disease variants), and GWAS Catalog (trait-associated variants). GTEx data will provide tissue-specific expression and eQTL information. All datasets will be processed through standardized pipelines to ensure compatibility, with quality control metrics applied to exclude low-quality data. We will develop a unified data warehouse with consistent genomic coordinates, metadata annotations, and access interfaces.

Structural Motif Discovery and Functional Classification (Months 4-12): We will apply multiple complementary approaches to identify structural motifs. First, we will use graph-based clustering algorithms to identify recurrent structural patterns in chemical probing data, representing RNA structures as graphs where nodes represent nucleotides and edges represent base-pairing interactions. Second, we will employ hidden Markov models to identify conserved structural elements across species, allowing for sequence variation while maintaining structural constraints. Third, we will develop deep learning models using convolutional neural networks to learn structural features directly from probing data without imposing predefined structural representations. Identified motifs will be functionally classified by integrating ribosome profiling data (translation regulation), subcellular RNA-seq (localization), mRNA half-life data (stability), and RNA-binding protein eCLIP data (protein interaction sites). We will perform enrichment analyses to associate motif classes with specific regulatory outcomes and develop a hierarchical classification system for structural regulatory elements.

Evolutionary Analysis and Functional Constraint Identification (Months 6-15): To distinguish functional from neutral structures, we will develop metrics quantifying structural conservation independent of sequence conservation. We will implement covariation analysis identifying compensatory mutations that maintain base-pairing, calculate structural conservation scores based on alignment of predicted structures across species, and develop phylogenetic models testing for selection on structural features. We will integrate these evolutionary metrics with experimental structure data to train machine learning classifiers distinguishing functional from neutral structures. Classifier features will include structural conservation scores, consistency of structure across experimental replicates and conditions, association with regulatory outcomes, and enrichment for disease-associated variants. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and by testing predictions against held-out datasets and literature-curated functional structures.

Variant Impact Prediction and Disease Association Analysis (Months 10-18): We will develop computational pipelines predicting structural impacts of genetic variants using both thermodynamic modeling (RNAsnp, remuRNA) and machine learning approaches trained on experimental data. For each variant, we will calculate structural disruption scores, predict changes in RNA-binding protein affinity, and estimate impacts on translation efficiency based on ribosome profiling patterns. We will perform population genetics analyses calculating selection coefficients for structure-disrupting variants across functional constraint categories. Disease association analyses will test for enrichment of structure-disrupting variants among ClinVar pathogenic variants and GWAS hits, using permutation-based statistical tests controlling for local mutation rates, recombination rates, and other genomic features. We will prioritize candidate disease variants for community follow-up based on predicted structural impacts and disease associations.

RNA Modification-Structure Integration (Months 12-20): We will integrate RNA modification maps with structure probing data from matched cell types and conditions. For modification sites, we will compare local structural patterns in modification-enriched versus modification-depleted contexts, using statistical tests to identify significant structural differences. We will develop thermodynamic models incorporating modification-induced stability changes and train machine learning models predicting modification-dependent structural alterations. We will examine functional consequences by correlating modification-induced structural changes with changes in translation efficiency, RNA-binding protein occupancy, and mRNA stability across conditions where modification levels vary.

Resource Development and Dissemination (Months 15-24): We will develop a comprehensive RNA Structure Atlas as a public web resource providing searchable access to all identified structural motifs, functional annotations, evolutionary conservation data, and variant impact predictions. We will create validated structural motif libraries in standard formats compatible with existing RNA analysis tools. We will implement prediction tools as user-friendly web servers and command-line software for identifying regulatory structures in user-provided sequences. All analysis code will be deposited in GitHub repositories with comprehensive documentation. We will organize two training workshops teaching integrative RNA structure analysis methods to graduate students and postdocs from diverse institutions.

Timeline and Milestones: Months 1-6: Data compilation and integration infrastructure; Month 6: First project meeting and trainee workshop; Months 7-12: Initial motif discovery and functional classification; Month 12: Interim results presentation at national meeting; Months 13-18: Evolutionary analyses and variant impact predictions; Month 18: Second project meeting and trainee workshop; Months 19-24: Resource development, manuscript preparation, and dissemination. The project team will meet monthly via videoconference with in-person meetings at months 6, 12, and 18.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative resources and insights advancing multiple areas of molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for collaborative data integration.

Primary Deliverables and Scientific Contributions: The RNA Structure Atlas will provide the first comprehensive, experimentally-informed map of functional RNA structures across human and model organism transcriptomes. This resource will include structural annotations for >50,000 transcripts, validated motif libraries containing 200-500 distinct structural regulatory elements with functional classifications, and genome-wide predictions of structure-disrupting variants with disease relevance. Unlike existing RNA structure databases that primarily catalog individual studies, our atlas will synthesize information across thousands of datasets, providing confidence scores based on consistency across experiments and evolutionary conservation. The atlas will enable researchers to query structural features of any transcript of interest, identify similar structural motifs across the transcriptome, and assess potential impacts of genetic variants on RNA structure and function. We will develop and disseminate computational tools including machine learning models for predicting functional RNA structures from sequence, algorithms for identifying structure-disrupting variants, and pipelines for integrating diverse RNA structure datasets. These tools will be made available as web servers with intuitive interfaces for experimental biologists and as open-source software packages for computational researchers. All analysis workflows will be documented and shared through protocols.io and GitHub, ensuring reproducibility and enabling community adaptation.

Fundamental Scientific Insights: This project will address longstanding questions about the prevalence and importance of RNA structure in gene regulation. By systematically distinguishing functional from neutral structures, we will provide the first reliable estimates of what fraction of the transcriptome is under structural constraint, resolving debates about the regulatory importance of RNA structure. Our evolutionary analyses will reveal principles governing structural conservation, including the relative contributions of sequence conservation versus compensatory mutations in maintaining functional structures. The comprehensive motif catalog will establish a classification system for structural regulatory elements analogous to transcription factor binding site classifications, enabling systematic study of post-transcriptional regulatory logic. Our variant impact analyses will illuminate how genetic variation affects RNA structure and contribute to understanding non-coding disease mechanisms, potentially explaining pathogenic mechanisms for variants currently classified as variants of uncertain significance. The integration of RNA modification data with structural information will reveal how dynamic structural remodeling regulates gene expression in response to cellular signals, establishing modification-structure relationships as a regulatory layer.

Broader Impacts and Applications: The resources and insights generated will impact multiple research communities. For RNA biologists, the atlas will provide hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms for thousands of transcripts, accelerating discovery of novel regulatory elements. For human geneticists, variant impact predictions will aid interpretation of non-coding variants in clinical sequencing, potentially reclassifying variants of uncertain significance and identifying new disease genes. For drug developers, the catalog of functional structures will provide new therapeutic targets for RNA-targeted small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides, particularly relevant given recent successes of RNA-based therapeutics. For evolutionary biologists, our analyses of structural constraint will provide new perspectives on molecular evolution and the evolution of gene regulation. For computational biologists, our machine learning models and integration frameworks will establish methodological paradigms applicable to other synthesis challenges. The project will also impact education by training graduate students and postdocs in integrative, data-intensive approaches to biological questions, preparing the next generation of researchers for increasingly data-rich biology.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: We will publish findings in high-impact journals including Nature, Science, Cell, and specialized journals such as Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Molecular Cell, and Genome Research. We anticipate 8-12 publications including comprehensive papers describing the overall atlas and approach, focused papers on specific findings (evolutionary principles, disease variants, modification-structure relationships), and methods papers describing computational tools. All publications will be open access or deposited in PubMed Central. We will present findings at major conferences including the RNA Society Meeting, ASHG, ISMB, and relevant Gordon Research Conferences. We will organize symposia at these meetings to disseminate methods and engage the community. The RNA Structure Atlas will be promoted through webinars, social media, and direct outreach to relevant research communities. We will establish an advisory board including representatives from clinical genetics, pharmaceutical industry, and diverse research communities to guide resource development and ensure broad utility.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: Beyond the initial project period, we envision the RNA Structure Atlas becoming a community resource analogous to ENCODE or GTEx, with ongoing updates as new data become available. We will pursue additional funding to support long-term maintenance and expansion, including integration of single-cell RNA structure data, structures from additional species, and experimental validation of predicted functional elements. We will establish partnerships with existing genomics resources to integrate structural annotations into widely-used genome browsers and databases. The collaborative network established through this project will continue through follow-up projects addressing questions emerging from initial findings, including experimental validation efforts and extension to other RNA regulatory mechanisms. The training workshops will be developed into sustainable educational programs offered regularly to the broader community. Ultimately, this project will establish RNA structure as a standard consideration in genomic analyses, transforming how researchers approach questions about gene regulation, genetic variation, and disease mechanisms.

The concept of cellular identity has been central to biology since the recognition that multicellular organisms comprise distinct cell types with specialized functions. Traditionally, cell types were defined by morphology, location, and marker expression, but the advent of single-cell technologies has revealed unprecedented complexity in cellular states. Rather than discrete categories, cells occupy a continuous landscape of molecular configurations, challenging our fundamental understanding of what constitutes a cell type and how cells transition between states. This paradigm shift necessitates new conceptual and computational frameworks to map and understand cellular state space.

Recent advances in single-cell genomics have generated massive datasets profiling individual cells across tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions. The Human Cell Atlas initiative alone aims to profile every cell type in the human body, while projects like ENCODE, the Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas, and numerous disease-specific atlases have produced petabytes of publicly available data. However, these datasets remain largely siloed, analyzed independently with inconsistent methodologies, and interpreted through the lens of traditional cell type classifications. The field lacks integrative frameworks that synthesize across datasets, modalities, and biological contexts to reveal universal principles of cellular state organization.

Waddington's epigenetic landscape metaphor, proposed in 1957, envisioned development as cells rolling down valleys toward stable cell fates, but this remained a conceptual model without quantitative grounding. Recent theoretical work has begun formalizing cellular state spaces using concepts from dynamical systems theory, treating cell states as attractors in high-dimensional gene expression space. Studies by Trapnell and colleagues on trajectory inference, Regev's work on cell atlases, and theoretical frameworks from Huang and colleagues on cell fate decisions have laid important groundwork. However, current approaches face critical limitations: they typically analyze single datasets in isolation, focus on specific tissues or processes, use incompatible computational methods that prevent cross-study comparisons, and lack rigorous mathematical frameworks for defining state boundaries and transition probabilities.

Several key gaps limit our understanding of cellular state space. First, we lack consensus on how to define cell type boundaries—are they sharp transitions or gradual continua? Second, the rules governing state transitions remain poorly understood—what molecular changes permit or prevent transitions between states? Third, we don't know whether universal principles govern state organization across different biological contexts, or whether each tissue and organism follows unique rules. Fourth, the relationship between different molecular layers (transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, proteome) in defining and constraining cellular states remains unclear. Finally, we lack predictive frameworks that can forecast how cells will respond to perturbations or navigate state space during reprogramming, differentiation, or disease transformation.

This research is critically important and timely for several reasons. First, understanding cellular state transitions is fundamental to regenerative medicine, as reprogramming and directed differentiation require navigating cells through state space toward desired fates. Second, cancer can be viewed as aberrant navigation of cellular state space, and mapping these trajectories could reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities. Third, the explosion of single-cell data provides an unprecedented opportunity for synthesis that wasn't possible even five years ago. Fourth, recent advances in topological data analysis, optimal transport theory, and deep learning provide new mathematical tools for analyzing high-dimensional state spaces. Finally, the field is at an inflection point where synthesis across datasets could yield transformative insights that individual studies cannot achieve.

The significance of this work extends beyond basic science. Clinically, understanding state transitions could improve cell therapy manufacturing, identify disease biomarkers based on aberrant state trajectories, and reveal new therapeutic strategies that push diseased cells toward healthy states. Technologically, this project will develop computational infrastructure and analytical frameworks that will benefit the entire single-cell community. Educationally, training researchers to integrate diverse data types and apply quantitative frameworks to biological questions addresses a critical workforce need. This synthesis project requires collaboration across disciplines—developmental biologists to interpret cellular states, computational biologists to process massive datasets, physicists and mathematicians to develop theoretical frameworks, and machine learning experts to build predictive models—making it ideally suited for community-scale synthesis support.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses five interconnected research questions that will fundamentally advance our understanding of cellular state organization and dynamics.

Research Question 1: What is the global architecture of cellular state space, and how is it organized across tissues, developmental stages, and species? We hypothesize that cellular state space exhibits hierarchical organization with major basins corresponding to germ layers and tissue lineages, within which finer-scale attractors represent individual cell types. We predict that this organization will be conserved across species at higher hierarchical levels but diverge at finer scales. To test this, we will integrate single-cell transcriptomic data from human, mouse, zebrafish, and Drosophila developmental atlases, applying manifold learning and topological data analysis to identify the dimensionality and structure of state space. We will quantify the number and stability of attractor states, measure distances between cell types in state space, and determine whether these distances correlate with lineage relationships and differentiation trajectories. Expected outcomes include a quantitative map of cellular state space architecture and metrics for measuring state similarity across species.

Research Question 2: What molecular features define boundaries between cell types, and are these boundaries sharp or gradual? We hypothesize that cell type boundaries correspond to ridges in the Waddington landscape where regulatory networks create barriers to state transitions, and that boundary sharpness varies depending on the developmental or functional relationship between cell types. We predict that transcription factor networks and chromatin accessibility patterns will show coordinated changes at boundaries, with sharp boundaries characterized by bistable regulatory circuits and gradual boundaries by continuous regulatory gradients. To test this, we will integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to identify regions of state space with rapid versus gradual molecular changes. We will apply potential landscape reconstruction methods to estimate barrier heights between states and use information theory to quantify the distinctness of cell type clusters. We will validate predictions by analyzing reprogramming datasets where cells cross boundaries, testing whether predicted barrier heights correlate with reprogramming efficiency. Expected outcomes include a classification of boundary types and molecular signatures that predict boundary properties.

Research Question 3: What are the universal principles governing cell state transitions, and how do regulatory networks constrain possible trajectories? We hypothesize that state transitions follow minimum-action paths through state space, constrained by the regulatory network topology, and that certain hub transcription factors act as gatekeepers controlling access to different regions of state space. We predict that natural developmental trajectories will follow paths of least resistance (lowest barrier heights) and that forced reprogramming trajectories that deviate from these paths will be less efficient. To test this, we will analyze lineage tracing data integrated with single-cell profiles to map actual trajectories cells take during development. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks from multi-modal data and use dynamical systems modeling to predict allowed versus forbidden transitions. We will compare predicted optimal paths with observed trajectories in development, reprogramming, and transdifferentiation datasets. Expected outcomes include a catalog of transition rules, identification of gatekeeper factors, and predictive models for trajectory optimization.

Research Question 4: How do cells navigate state space during reprogramming, and what determines success versus failure? We hypothesize that successful reprogramming requires cells to overcome specific regulatory barriers in a defined sequence, and that failed reprogramming results from cells becoming trapped in intermediate attractor states. We predict that reprogramming trajectories will show stereotyped intermediate states and that the probability of reaching the target state depends on successfully traversing these waypoints. To test this, we will synthesize data from iPSC reprogramming, direct reprogramming, and transdifferentiation experiments across multiple protocols and cell types. We will identify common intermediate states, quantify transition probabilities between states, and determine which molecular changes predict successful versus failed reprogramming. We will build probabilistic models of reprogramming trajectories and validate predictions against held-out datasets. Expected outcomes include a roadmap of reprogramming routes and molecular signatures predicting reprogramming outcomes.

Research Question 5: How is cellular state space altered in disease, particularly cancer, and can we identify therapeutic strategies based on state space navigation? We hypothesize that disease involves aberrant attractor states or altered transition probabilities, and that therapeutic interventions can be understood as pushing cells toward healthy regions of state space. We predict that cancer cells occupy distinct regions of state space characterized by partial dedifferentiation and that metastatic potential correlates with increased state plasticity. To test this, we will integrate single-cell data from healthy tissues, primary tumors, metastases, and cancer cell lines across multiple cancer types. We will map disease states relative to normal developmental trajectories, quantify state space alterations, and identify molecular perturbations that could redirect diseased cells toward healthy states. Expected outcomes include disease state maps, identification of therapeutic targets based on state space analysis, and a framework for rational design of combination therapies that sequentially push cells through state space.

Across all questions, we will validate computational predictions through multiple approaches: comparison with experimental perturbation data, cross-validation across independent datasets, and consistency checks across different analytical methods. Success will be measured by the ability to predict cell behavior in held-out datasets and the generation of testable hypotheses for future experimental validation.

Methods And Approach

Our methodological approach integrates data synthesis, computational analysis, theoretical modeling, and tool development across a 36-month timeline organized into four overlapping phases.

Data Sources and Integration (Months 1-12): We will systematically identify and curate publicly available datasets from multiple repositories. Primary sources include: (1) Human Cell Atlas data portal (>50 million cells across tissues), (2) ENCODE single-cell datasets (chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics), (3) Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas and related developmental atlases, (4) Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens cross-tissue compendia, (5) Developmental atlases from zebrafish, Xenopus, and Drosophila, (6) Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and tumor atlas projects, (7) Reprogramming datasets from GEO and ArrayExpress (iPSC, direct reprogramming, transdifferentiation), and (8) Lineage tracing datasets with coupled single-cell profiling. We will establish data quality criteria including minimum cell numbers, sequencing depth thresholds, and metadata completeness. A dedicated data curation team will standardize metadata using ontologies (Cell Ontology, Uberon, Disease Ontology) and process raw data through uniform pipelines. For scRNA-seq, we will use Seurat and Scanpy pipelines with consistent quality control, normalization, and batch correction (Harmony, scVI). For scATAC-seq, we will use ArchR and SnapATAC2 with peak calling and motif enrichment. Multi-modal integration will employ MOFA+, Seurat v4 WNN, and MultiVI. We anticipate integrating 200+ datasets representing >100 million cells.

Computational Infrastructure and Analysis Pipeline (Months 1-36): We will establish cloud-based computational infrastructure using AWS or Google Cloud with distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Dask) to handle petabyte-scale data. Our analysis pipeline comprises five integrated modules: (1) Dimensionality reduction and manifold learning using UMAP, diffusion maps, and variational autoencoders to embed cells in low-dimensional state space while preserving global structure. (2) Attractor state identification using density-based clustering (HDBSCAN), Gaussian mixture models, and persistent homology to identify stable cell states and quantify their basin sizes. (3) Trajectory inference using RNA velocity, Waddington-OT optimal transport, and CellRank to reconstruct transition paths and estimate transition probabilities. (4) Regulatory network reconstruction using SCENIC+, CellOracle, and GRNBoost to infer gene regulatory networks from multi-modal data. (5) Landscape reconstruction using potential energy surface estimation methods adapted from statistical physics, implementing algorithms from Bhattacharya et al. and Wang et al. to quantify barrier heights and transition rates.

Mathematical and Theoretical Framework Development (Months 6-30): We will develop rigorous mathematical frameworks for cellular state space analysis. First, we will apply topological data analysis using persistent homology to characterize the shape of state space, identifying holes, voids, and connected components that represent biological structures. We will use the Mapper algorithm to create topological networks of cellular states. Second, we will implement landscape theory from statistical physics, treating cells as particles in a potential energy landscape where gene expression dynamics follow stochastic differential equations. We will estimate potential functions using maximum entropy methods and calculate transition rates using Kramers theory. Third, we will develop information-theoretic measures of cell type distinctness using mutual information, transfer entropy, and channel capacity to quantify boundary sharpness. Fourth, we will apply optimal transport theory to measure distances between cell state distributions and infer minimum-cost paths through state space. Fifth, we will build probabilistic graphical models representing state transition networks with edge weights reflecting transition probabilities.

Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling (Months 12-36): We will develop deep learning models for state prediction and trajectory forecasting. We will train variational autoencoders to learn compressed representations of cellular states that capture biological variation while removing technical noise. We will implement graph neural networks that operate on cell-cell similarity graphs to predict state transitions. We will develop temporal models using recurrent neural networks and neural ODEs to forecast trajectory dynamics. All models will be trained on 80% of data with 20% held out for validation, using cross-validation across datasets to ensure generalizability. We will implement interpretability methods (attention mechanisms, SHAP values) to identify molecular features driving predictions.

Validation and Benchmarking (Months 18-36): We will validate predictions through multiple approaches: (1) Cross-dataset validation testing whether models trained on one dataset generalize to independent datasets, (2) Perturbation prediction testing whether models correctly predict outcomes of genetic or chemical perturbations in held-out datasets, (3) Reprogramming prediction testing whether predicted optimal paths match efficient reprogramming protocols, (4) Benchmark comparisons evaluating our methods against existing trajectory inference and cell type classification tools using standardized metrics.

Tool Development and Dissemination (Months 12-36): We will develop open-source software packages in Python and R implementing our methods, with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. We will create an interactive web portal for exploring the cellular state atlas with visualization tools for navigating state space, querying cell types, and predicting trajectories. All code will be version-controlled on GitHub with continuous integration testing.

Timeline and Milestones: Months 1-6: Data curation and infrastructure setup; Months 6-12: Initial integration and attractor identification; Months 12-18: Boundary analysis and regulatory network reconstruction; Months 18-24: Trajectory analysis and landscape reconstruction; Months 24-30: Disease state mapping and therapeutic prediction; Months 30-36: Tool finalization, validation, and dissemination. Quarterly meetings will assess progress against milestones with adaptive planning to address challenges.

Team Composition and Collaboration: Our team spans developmental biology (3 labs), computational biology (4 labs), physics/applied mathematics (2 labs), and machine learning (2 labs) across 8 institutions and 4 countries, representing diverse career stages from graduate students to senior investigators. Monthly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops, and collaborative coding sprints will facilitate integration.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will deliver transformative outcomes across multiple dimensions, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications in cellular biology.

Scientific Outcomes and Contributions: The primary scientific deliverable is a comprehensive Cellular State Atlas—an interactive, quantitative map of cellular state space integrating data from millions of cells across species, tissues, and conditions. This atlas will provide the first unified framework for understanding cell identity, revealing the global architecture of cellular states and the rules governing transitions between them. We expect to identify 500-1000 distinct attractor states across integrated datasets, characterize their stability and basin geometries, and map the network of possible transitions. This will fundamentally advance our understanding of what defines a cell type, moving beyond descriptive marker-based classifications to quantitative, dynamics-based definitions grounded in state space geometry and regulatory network structure.

We will establish universal principles of cell state organization, determining whether common architectural features exist across biological contexts or whether each system follows unique rules. We anticipate discovering conserved organizational principles at higher hierarchical levels (germ layer organization, epithelial-mesenchymal axes) while identifying context-specific features at finer scales. This will resolve long-standing debates about the discrete versus continuous nature of cell types by showing that both views are partially correct—cell types represent local attractors in a continuous state space, with boundary sharpness varying depending on regulatory network topology.

Our analysis of state transitions will reveal molecular rules governing cellular plasticity, identifying gatekeeper transcription factors, chromatin remodeling requirements, and metabolic constraints that permit or prevent specific transitions. We will generate a catalog of transition paths with associated barrier heights and transition rates, enabling prediction of which reprogramming strategies will succeed. This addresses fundamental questions in developmental biology about lineage restriction and cell fate commitment while providing practical guidance for regenerative medicine applications.

The disease state mapping component will reveal how pathological conditions alter cellular state space, identifying aberrant attractors in cancer, fibrosis, and other diseases. We expect to show that cancer cells occupy regions of state space corresponding to developmental intermediates or hybrid states, explaining their plasticity and therapeutic resistance. This will suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on state space navigation—using combinations of perturbations to push diseased cells toward healthy attractors or trap them in therapeutically vulnerable states.

Computational and Methodological Impact: We will deliver a suite of open-source computational tools that will become community standards for single-cell analysis. These include: (1) StateSpace—a Python package for state space mapping and landscape reconstruction, (2) TransitionNet—tools for trajectory inference and transition probability estimation, (3) MultiModalIntegrator—standardized workflows for integrating scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and proteomics data, (4) CellPredictor—machine learning models for predicting cell state transitions and perturbation responses. All tools will be documented, benchmarked, and distributed through standard repositories (PyPI, Bioconductor) with Docker containers ensuring reproducibility.

The mathematical frameworks we develop will bridge biology and physics, demonstrating how concepts from statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory can be rigorously applied to cellular systems. This will open new avenues for theoretical biology and inspire applications to other complex biological systems.

Broader Impacts and Applications: The clinical implications are substantial. Our reprogramming roadmaps will accelerate development of cell therapies by identifying optimal protocols for generating desired cell types. Disease state maps will reveal biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic monitoring. State-space-based therapeutic strategies could enable rational design of combination therapies that sequentially push cells through state space toward desired outcomes.

Educational and training impacts will be significant. We will train 15-20 graduate students and postdocs in quantitative approaches to cell biology, preparing them for careers at the biology-computation interface. We will develop and disseminate educational materials including online tutorials, workshop curricula, and a textbook chapter on cellular state space concepts. Annual workshops will train 50-100 external researchers in our methods and tools.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: We will publish findings in high-impact journals (Nature, Science, Cell) for major discoveries and specialized journals (Nature Methods, Genome Biology, Cell Systems) for methodological advances. We commit to preprint posting and open access publication. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be publicly available through GitHub, Zenodo, and the Cellular State Atlas portal. We will present findings at major conferences (ASCB, ISSCR, ISMB) and organize symposia bringing together experimental and computational researchers.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes infrastructure and community connections that will persist beyond the funding period. The Cellular State Atlas will be maintained as a community resource with mechanisms for incorporating new datasets. The computational tools will be sustained through community adoption and continued development. We will pursue follow-up funding to extend the framework to additional biological contexts, incorporate spatial information, and develop real-time state prediction for guiding experimental decisions. We envision this project catalyzing a paradigm shift toward quantitative, dynamics-based understanding of cellular identity that will shape molecular and cellular biology for decades to come.

The requested budget of $2,500,000 over three years will support the personnel, computational infrastructure, and activities necessary for this ambitious synthesis project. This budget reflects the community-scale nature of the work, requiring coordination across multiple institutions and disciplines beyond what individual labs could support.

Personnel (60% of budget, $1,500,000): Personnel costs constitute the largest budget component, supporting the diverse expertise required for this synthesis project. We request support for: (1) Project Coordinator (100% effort, 3 years, $240,000)—a PhD-level scientist who will manage data curation, coordinate across institutions, organize meetings and workshops, and ensure project integration. This role is essential for synthesis projects requiring coordination beyond typical lab structures.

This personnel structure ensures both the technical capacity to execute the work and training opportunities for the next generation workforce.

Computational Infrastructure (25% of budget, $625,000): The scale of data integration requires substantial computational resources beyond what individual institutions typically provide. This includes: (1) Cloud Computing Resources ($400,000)—AWS or Google Cloud credits for data storage (estimated 500TB), distributed computing for processing 100+ million cells, and hosting the interactive atlas portal. We estimate $10,000-15,000 monthly for compute and storage costs.

This synthesis project will integrate diverse interaction datasets (AP-MS, Y2H, proximity labeling, crosslinking MS, structural predictions from AlphaFold-Multimer) with functional genomics, phosphoproteomics, and cellular localization data to construct comprehensive context-dependent interaction networks. By uniting structural biologists, systems biologists, biophysicists, and network scientists, we will develop methods to predict transient interactions, identify their regulatory contexts, and understand their functional consequences. The project will synthesize data from BioGRID, STRING, IntAct, and recent proteome-wide studies across multiple organisms to address how cells use weak interactions for signal processing and regulation. We will apply machine learning to distinguish functional transient interactions from non-specific binding, integrate structural data to understand interaction interfaces, and map how post-translational modifications modulate interaction dynamics. This addresses the fundamental gap in understanding cellular regulation beyond stable protein complexes. The synthesis requires integration of orthogonal experimental approaches, structural modeling at proteome scale, and network analysis tools that exceed individual laboratory capabilities. Outputs will include a dynamic interaction atlas with confidence scores and context annotations, predictive algorithms for transient interactions, standardized data integration pipelines, and interdisciplinary training modules. This resource will reveal hidden regulatory layers and provide new frameworks for understanding cellular decision-making.",,"Background And Significance

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form the foundation of virtually all cellular processes, from signal transduction and metabolic regulation to gene expression and cell division. Over the past two decades, systematic efforts have catalogued tens of thousands of interactions across model organisms, creating comprehensive interaction networks that have transformed our understanding of cellular organization. However, these networks suffer from a critical blind spot: they predominantly capture stable, high-affinity interactions while systematically missing the transient and weak interactions that constitute the majority of regulatory events in living cells. This 'interaction dark matter' represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of cellular regulation and decision-making.

Current protein interaction databases, including BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct, contain over 2 million documented interactions across species. Yet multiple lines of evidence suggest these represent only a fraction of functionally relevant interactions. Biophysical studies indicate that most regulatory interactions occur with dissociation constants in the micromolar to millimolar range and lifetimes of milliseconds to seconds, making them difficult to capture with conventional methods. Affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), the workhorse of interactome mapping, preferentially identifies stable complexes due to washing steps that disrupt weak interactions. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, while capable of detecting transient interactions, suffer from high false-positive rates and miss interactions requiring post-translational modifications or specific cellular contexts. The result is a systematic bias toward stable 'housekeeping' complexes at the expense of dynamic regulatory interactions.

Recent technological advances have begun to illuminate this dark matter. Proximity labeling methods like BioID and APEX capture proteins in close spatial proximity regardless of interaction strength, revealing context-dependent interaction neighborhoods. Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) provides snapshots of transient interactions by covalently linking proteins before purification. Advances in structural biology, particularly AlphaFold-Multimer, now enable prediction of interaction interfaces at proteome scale, offering complementary evidence for potential interactions. Phosphoproteomics datasets reveal how post-translational modifications regulate interaction dynamics. Cellular localization studies show how spatial organization constrains interaction possibilities. However, these diverse datasets remain largely siloed, analyzed independently without systematic integration.

The significance of transient interactions extends far beyond filling gaps in interaction maps. Weak interactions enable ultrasensitive switches, allow rapid signal propagation, facilitate competitive binding dynamics, and create regulatory flexibility impossible with stable complexes alone. In signaling cascades, transient interactions between kinases and substrates enable rapid response and reversibility. In transcriptional regulation, weak interactions between transcription factors and co-regulators allow combinatorial control and context-dependent gene expression. In metabolic regulation, transient enzyme-enzyme interactions enable substrate channeling and allosteric regulation. Understanding these interactions is essential for comprehending how cells process information, make decisions, and respond to environmental changes.

Several fundamental questions remain unanswered. What distinguishes functional transient interactions from non-specific binding events that occur due to high cellular protein concentrations? How do cells regulate interaction dynamics through post-translational modifications, localization changes, and conformational switches? What network motifs and architectural principles govern transient interaction networks? How do transient interactions contribute to cellular phenotypes and disease states? Addressing these questions requires integrating orthogonal experimental approaches, each capturing different aspects of the interaction landscape, with computational methods that can distinguish signal from noise at unprecedented scale.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exists across multiple public repositories, representing billions of dollars of experimental investment. Second, structural prediction tools have matured to enable proteome-scale modeling. Third, machine learning approaches can now integrate heterogeneous data types to extract biological insights. Fourth, the field increasingly recognizes that understanding cellular regulation requires moving beyond static interaction networks to dynamic, context-dependent models. Finally, this synthesis requires expertise spanning structural biology, proteomics, biophysics, network science, and machine learning—a truly transdisciplinary effort beyond the scope of individual laboratories. By illuminating protein interaction dark matter, this project will fundamentally advance our understanding of cellular regulation and provide new frameworks for interpreting functional genomics data, understanding disease mechanisms, and designing therapeutic interventions.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to illuminate the hidden layer of transient and weak protein interactions governing cellular regulation.

Research Question 1: What is the scope and functional significance of transient protein interactions across cellular contexts? We hypothesize that transient interactions outnumber stable interactions by at least 3:1 in the functional interactome, with enrichment in regulatory processes (signaling, transcription, cell cycle control) compared to housekeeping functions (translation, metabolism, protein folding). We predict that integrating proximity labeling data with AP-MS and Y2H datasets will reveal 50,000-100,000 previously uncharacterized context-dependent interactions in human cells alone. To test this hypothesis, we will systematically compare interaction detection across methods, identifying interactions captured by proximity labeling or XL-MS but absent from AP-MS databases. We will assess functional enrichment using Gene Ontology and pathway databases, expecting transient interactions to show significant enrichment in signal transduction (p<0.001) and transcriptional regulation (p<0.001) compared to stable complexes. We will validate predictions by examining known regulatory systems where transient interactions are well-characterized (e.g., MAPK cascades, NF-κB signaling) and quantifying the ratio of transient to stable interactions. Expected outcomes include a quantitative census of transient interactions across cellular processes and identification of biological contexts where transient interactions predominate.

Research Question 2: Can we distinguish functional transient interactions from non-specific binding using integrated multi-modal data? We hypothesize that functional transient interactions exhibit distinct signatures across multiple data dimensions: structural complementarity at interaction interfaces, evolutionary conservation of interface residues, co-expression and co-localization patterns, and functional relationships in genetic interaction networks. We predict that machine learning models integrating these features will achieve >80% accuracy in distinguishing functional transient interactions from non-specific binding, substantially outperforming single-data-type approaches. To test this, we will develop supervised learning models trained on gold-standard positive examples (literature-curated transient interactions with functional validation) and negative examples (computationally predicted non-specific interactions). Features will include AlphaFold-Multimer confidence scores, interface residue conservation from multiple sequence alignments, co-expression correlation from transcriptomics databases, co-localization evidence from imaging studies, and genetic interaction profiles from CRISPR and RNAi screens. We will employ ensemble methods combining gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks, with rigorous cross-validation and holdout testing. Model performance will be evaluated using precision-recall curves, with particular attention to high-precision regimes suitable for generating testable predictions. Expected deliverables include validated predictive models, feature importance rankings revealing which data types most effectively distinguish functional interactions, and confidence scores for all predicted transient interactions.

Research Question 3: How do post-translational modifications and cellular context modulate interaction dynamics? We hypothesize that post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, act as dynamic switches that regulate interaction strength and specificity, with >30% of transient interactions showing context-dependent regulation. We predict that integrating phosphoproteomics data with interaction networks will reveal specific PTM sites that modulate interaction interfaces, creating condition-specific interaction networks. To test this hypothesis, we will map PTM sites from PhosphoSitePlus, iPTMnet, and published phosphoproteomics studies onto protein structures and interaction interfaces predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. We will identify PTM sites within 8Å of predicted interaction interfaces, hypothesizing these directly modulate binding. We will integrate time-resolved phosphoproteomics data from stimulus-response experiments to identify PTMs that change coincident with interaction dynamics. For cellular context, we will integrate subcellular localization data from the Human Protein Atlas and dynamic localization studies to identify interactions requiring specific compartmentalization. We will construct context-specific networks for different cell types, cell cycle stages, and signaling states. Expected outcomes include a PTM-annotated interaction atlas, identification of regulatory PTM sites controlling interaction dynamics, and context-specific interaction networks revealing how interaction landscapes change across cellular conditions.

Research Question 4: What network principles govern transient interaction networks and their contribution to cellular information processing? We hypothesize that transient interaction networks exhibit distinct topological properties compared to stable complex networks, including higher clustering coefficients, shorter path lengths, and enrichment of specific network motifs (feed-forward loops, bifans) that enable ultrasensitive responses and signal integration. We predict that transient interactions create 'regulatory layers' that modulate stable complex functions, with hub proteins in transient networks showing enrichment for regulatory roles and disease associations. To test this, we will perform comprehensive network analysis comparing topological properties of transient versus stable interaction networks. We will identify network motifs using established algorithms and assess their functional significance through enrichment analysis. We will examine how transient interactions connect stable complexes, creating higher-order functional modules. We will integrate genetic interaction data to assess whether transient interaction partners show enhanced genetic interactions, indicating functional interdependence. We will analyze disease-associated mutations from ClinVar and COSMIC, hypothesizing enrichment at transient interaction interfaces. Expected deliverables include quantitative characterization of transient network topology, identification of regulatory network motifs, and mechanistic models of how transient interactions enable cellular information processing and decision-making. These insights will provide new frameworks for understanding cellular regulation and interpreting functional genomics data.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse publicly available datasets through a multi-phase analytical pipeline, combining data harmonization, machine learning, structural modeling, and network analysis. The project spans 36 months with clearly defined milestones and deliverables.

Phase 1: Data Collection and Harmonization (Months 1-6). We will systematically collect protein interaction data from multiple sources representing different experimental modalities. From BioGRID (>2M interactions), STRING (>3B interactions across species), IntAct (>1M curated interactions), and MINT, we will extract stable interaction data with associated confidence scores and experimental evidence codes. We will compile proximity labeling data from published BioID, APEX, and TurboID studies, accessing raw data from PRIDE and MassIVE proteomics repositories. Crosslinking mass spectrometry data will be collected from published XL-MS studies and the PRIDE-XL database. For each interaction, we will extract experimental method, organism, cell type, and conditions. We will download AlphaFold-Multimer predictions for all human, mouse, yeast, and E. coli protein pairs from the AlphaFold database, focusing on predictions with interface pTM scores >0.5. Phosphoproteomics data will be compiled from PhosphoSitePlus (>500K PTM sites), iPTMnet, and published time-resolved phosphoproteomics studies from PRIDE. Subcellular localization data will be obtained from the Human Protein Atlas, Cell-PLoc, and published imaging studies. Functional genomics data including gene expression (GTEx, Expression Atlas), genetic interactions (BioGRID, CORUM), and phenotype associations (MGI, SGD) will be integrated. All data will be harmonized to common protein identifiers using UniProt mappings, with careful tracking of orthology relationships across species. We will implement quality control filters, removing low-confidence interactions and ensuring reproducibility. Data will be stored in a graph database (Neo4j) enabling efficient querying of multi-modal relationships. Deliverable: Integrated multi-modal interaction database with >5M interactions and associated metadata.

Phase 2: Transient Interaction Identification and Classification (Months 7-15). We will develop computational methods to identify and classify transient interactions. First, we will categorize interactions by detection method, classifying those detected exclusively by proximity labeling or XL-MS (but not AP-MS) as candidate transient interactions. We will calculate method-specific detection frequencies, identifying interactions with high proximity labeling evidence but low AP-MS evidence as high-confidence transient candidates. Second, we will develop machine learning models to predict interaction stability. Training data will comprise literature-curated examples of stable complexes (from CORUM, PDB) and validated transient interactions (from literature mining of kinase-substrate, transcription factor-coregulator, and signaling protein interactions). Features will include: (1) AlphaFold-Multimer confidence scores and interface areas; (2) interface residue conservation calculated from multiple sequence alignments; (3) biophysical properties including interface hydrophobicity, charge complementarity, and predicted binding affinity from structural models; (4) co-expression correlation across tissues and conditions; (5) co-localization evidence; (6) genetic interaction profiles; (7) functional similarity scores. We will train gradient boosting models (XGBoost), random forests, and deep neural networks, using 5-fold cross-validation and holdout test sets. Model ensembles will generate probability scores for interaction stability. We will apply models to all interactions in our database, generating stability classifications and confidence scores. Third, we will perform systematic comparison of interaction detection across methods, calculating overlap statistics and identifying method-specific biases. Deliverable: Classified interaction database with stability predictions and confidence scores for >3M interactions.

Phase 3: PTM-Mediated Regulation and Context-Dependent Networks (Months 16-24). We will map post-translational modifications onto interaction interfaces to identify regulatory mechanisms. Using AlphaFold structures, we will identify PTM sites within 8Å of predicted interaction interfaces, hypothesizing these directly modulate binding. We will calculate enrichment of PTMs at interfaces versus non-interface regions, expecting significant enrichment (p<0.001) for regulatory PTMs. We will integrate time-resolved phosphoproteomics data from stimulus-response experiments (growth factor signaling, stress responses, cell cycle progression), identifying PTMs that change coincident with predicted interaction dynamics. We will construct temporal networks showing how interaction landscapes evolve following stimuli. For context-dependent analysis, we will build cell-type-specific networks by integrating cell-type-specific expression and localization data, identifying interactions possible only in specific cellular contexts. We will construct condition-specific networks for different cell cycle stages, differentiation states, and disease conditions using published transcriptomics and proteomics data. Network comparison will identify context-specific interactions and core interactions present across conditions. Deliverable: PTM-annotated interaction atlas and context-specific interaction networks for 10+ cellular conditions.

Phase 4: Network Analysis and Functional Characterization (Months 25-33). We will perform comprehensive network analysis to understand organizational principles. Topological analysis will calculate degree distributions, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and centrality measures, comparing transient versus stable networks. Motif analysis using FANMOD and custom algorithms will identify overrepresented network patterns. We will assess functional enrichment of network modules using Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, and Reactome. We will integrate genetic interaction data to identify functional relationships between transient interaction partners. Disease association analysis will map mutations from ClinVar and COSMIC onto interaction interfaces, calculating enrichment of disease mutations at transient versus stable interfaces. We will develop mechanistic models of specific regulatory systems (MAPK signaling, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation) incorporating transient interactions. Deliverable: Comprehensive network analysis results and mechanistic models.

Phase 5: Resource Development and Dissemination (Months 34-36). We will develop public-facing resources including an interactive web portal for querying the dynamic interaction atlas, downloadable datasets with standardized formats, analysis pipelines as documented workflows, and training materials. All code will be deposited on GitHub with comprehensive documentation. Deliverable: Public resources and publications.

Timeline Milestones: Month 6: Integrated database complete; Month 15: Transient interaction predictions complete; Month 24: Context-dependent networks complete; Month 33: Network analysis complete; Month 36: Resources published and manuscripts submitted.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative resources, methodologies, and insights that fundamentally advance molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for understanding cellular regulation.

Primary Deliverables and Resources. The Dynamic Interaction Atlas will constitute the project's flagship resource—a comprehensive, publicly accessible database integrating >5 million protein interactions with stability classifications, confidence scores, context annotations, and PTM regulatory information. Unlike existing databases that treat all interactions equivalently, our atlas will distinguish stable complexes from transient regulatory interactions, providing researchers with unprecedented insight into interaction dynamics. Each interaction will be annotated with supporting evidence from multiple experimental modalities, structural predictions, and functional context. The atlas will feature an interactive web interface enabling researchers to query interactions by protein, pathway, cellular context, or regulatory mechanism, visualize context-specific networks, and download customized datasets. This resource will be continuously maintained and updated as new data becomes available, ensuring long-term utility. We will develop and publicly release validated machine learning models for predicting transient interactions and assessing interaction stability. These models, trained on integrated multi-modal data, will enable researchers to generate predictions for novel protein pairs, prioritize interactions for experimental validation, and interpret their own interaction data. Models will be packaged as user-friendly software tools with comprehensive documentation and example workflows. We will create standardized data integration pipelines implemented as reproducible workflows using Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Nextflow, enabling other researchers to apply our approaches to new datasets or different organisms. All analysis code will be deposited in public GitHub repositories with detailed documentation, example datasets, and tutorials.

Scientific Advances and Insights. This project will address fundamental questions about cellular organization and regulation. By systematically characterizing transient interactions across cellular contexts, we will reveal the hidden regulatory layer that governs cellular decision-making. We expect to identify 50,000-100,000 previously uncharacterized transient interactions in human cells, dramatically expanding the known interactome and revealing regulatory connections invisible to conventional approaches. Our analysis of PTM-mediated regulation will elucidate molecular mechanisms by which cells dynamically control interaction networks, identifying specific phosphorylation sites, acetylation marks, and other modifications that act as molecular switches. This will provide mechanistic insight into signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle control. Context-dependent network analysis will reveal how interaction landscapes change across cell types, developmental stages, and disease states, explaining how the same proteome generates diverse cellular behaviors. Network topology analysis will uncover organizational principles governing transient interaction networks, identifying regulatory motifs that enable ultrasensitive responses, signal integration, and robust decision-making. These insights will establish new frameworks for understanding cellular information processing.

Broader Impacts Across Biology and Medicine. The resources and insights generated will impact diverse areas of biology. In systems biology, our dynamic interaction atlas will enable more accurate modeling of cellular processes, moving beyond static networks to dynamic, context-dependent models. In structural biology, integration of interaction data with AlphaFold predictions will validate and extend structural modeling approaches, identifying cases where predicted structures accurately capture transient interactions. In drug discovery, understanding transient interactions will reveal new therapeutic targets and explain drug mechanisms of action, particularly for drugs targeting signaling pathways. Disease-associated mutations mapped to transient interaction interfaces will provide mechanistic insights into genetic diseases and cancer, potentially identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In synthetic biology, understanding principles governing transient interactions will inform design of engineered regulatory circuits and biosensors.

Training and Workforce Development. The project will train the next generation of data-savvy researchers through multiple mechanisms. We will support 4-6 graduate students and postdocs as core team members, providing intensive training in data integration, machine learning, structural biology, and network analysis. These trainees will gain expertise spanning multiple disciplines, preparing them for leadership roles in data-driven biology. We will develop comprehensive training modules covering data integration strategies, machine learning for biological data, network analysis methods, and structural bioinformatics. These modules will be offered as intensive workshops at major conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, Biophysical Society) and as online courses, reaching hundreds of trainees. All training materials will be publicly available, enabling self-directed learning. We will establish a summer internship program bringing undergraduate students from diverse institutions into the project, providing research experiences in computational biology. We will prioritize recruitment of students from underrepresented groups and primarily undergraduate institutions.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy. Results will be disseminated through multiple channels ensuring broad impact. We will publish 6-8 high-impact papers in journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Molecular Cell, Nature Methods, and Nucleic Acids Research, covering the integrated atlas, machine learning methods, context-dependent networks, and biological insights. All publications will be open access, ensuring unrestricted availability. We will present findings at major conferences including ISMB, RECOMB, Biophysical Society, ASCB, and Keystone Symposia, engaging diverse scientific communities. The Dynamic Interaction Atlas will launch with comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and example use cases, supported by webinars and user workshops. We will engage with database communities (BioGRID, STRING, IntAct) to ensure interoperability and data sharing. We will establish a user community through mailing lists and forums, providing support and gathering feedback for continuous improvement.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability. Beyond the funding period, we envision this project catalyzing a paradigm shift toward dynamic, context-aware models of cellular regulation. The resources developed will serve as community infrastructure, analogous to how PDB and UniProt serve structural biology and protein science. We will pursue additional funding to expand coverage to additional organisms, integrate emerging data types (single-cell proteomics, in vivo crosslinking), and develop predictive models of interaction dynamics. We will establish partnerships with experimental groups to validate predictions, creating a virtuous cycle of prediction and validation. The interdisciplinary collaborations established will persist beyond this project, fostering continued innovation at disciplinary interfaces. Ultimately, this synthesis project will illuminate protein interaction dark matter, revealing the dynamic regulatory networks that enable cellular life.

This synthesis project will integrate mitochondrial and nuclear genome sequences from thousands of species, gene expression data, protein interaction networks, and population genomics datasets to understand how these two genomes maintain compatibility across evolutionary time. By bringing together evolutionary biologists, mitochondrial biologists, population geneticists, and systems biologists, we will analyze patterns of compensatory evolution, identify genes under coordinated selection, and determine how mitonuclear interactions constrain evolutionary trajectories. The project will synthesize data from GenBank, 1000 Genomes, population genomics databases, and mitochondrial disease repositories to test hypotheses about coevolutionary dynamics. We will develop computational frameworks to detect compensatory mutations, analyze expression coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and identify mitonuclear incompatibilities that contribute to hybrid breakdown and disease. This addresses fundamental questions about organellar evolution, the maintenance of mitochondrial genomes, and the genetic basis of metabolic diseases. The synthesis requires integration of phylogenomics, functional data, and population-level variation across diverse taxa—a scope impossible for individual laboratories. Deliverables include a mitonuclear coevolution database, tools for predicting compatibility, analysis workflows for detecting compensatory evolution, and training programs bridging evolutionary biology and molecular genetics that will equip trainees with skills in integrative genomics.",,"Background And Significance

Mitochondria are essential organelles that originated from an ancient endosymbiotic event approximately 1.5 billion years ago, when an alphaproteobacterium was engulfed by an archaeal host cell. This endosymbiosis fundamentally transformed eukaryotic evolution, providing the bioenergetic capacity necessary for complex multicellular life. However, this partnership created an unprecedented evolutionary challenge: two genomes with different inheritance patterns, mutation rates, and selective pressures must maintain functional compatibility to sustain cellular respiration and energy production. Despite over a century of research since mitochondria were first described, the mechanisms governing mitochondrial-nuclear (mitonuclear) coevolution remain one of the most compelling unsolved puzzles in molecular and cellular biology.

The mitochondrial genome has undergone dramatic reduction since endosymbiosis, with most ancestral genes transferred to the nucleus. Modern mitochondrial genomes typically encode only 13-37 proteins, along with essential tRNAs and rRNAs, while the nucleus encodes over 1,000 proteins that function in mitochondria. This creates an obligate interdependence: mitochondrial-encoded proteins must physically interact with nuclear-encoded partners to form functional complexes of the electron transport chain, ATP synthase, and other critical systems. The maintenance of this compatibility is particularly challenging given that mitochondrial genomes evolve 10-100 times faster than nuclear genomes in animals, experience different selective pressures due to maternal inheritance in most species, and accumulate mutations that can be deleterious when combined with certain nuclear backgrounds.

Recent research has revealed that mitonuclear incompatibilities have profound consequences across biological scales. At the molecular level, mismatches between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits can disrupt protein complex assembly, reduce respiratory efficiency, and increase reactive oxygen species production. Population genetic studies have demonstrated that mitonuclear interactions contribute to local adaptation, with certain mitochondrial haplotypes showing fitness advantages only in specific nuclear backgrounds. Evolutionary studies have implicated mitonuclear incompatibilities in reproductive isolation and speciation, particularly in hybrid zones where divergent populations meet. In humans, the interaction between mitochondrial variants and nuclear genetic backgrounds influences susceptibility to metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging-related phenotypes. Despite these insights, our understanding remains fragmented across disciplines and taxonomic groups.

Several critical gaps limit our comprehension of mitonuclear coevolution. First, most studies focus on single species or narrow taxonomic groups, preventing identification of universal principles versus lineage-specific patterns. Second, research typically examines either sequence evolution or functional consequences, rarely integrating both perspectives. Third, the field lacks comprehensive catalogs of mitonuclear interactions and their evolutionary dynamics across the tree of life. Fourth, we cannot reliably predict which mitochondrial-nuclear combinations will be compatible or incompatible, limiting our ability to understand hybrid breakdown, disease susceptibility, and conservation challenges in fragmented populations. Finally, the computational and analytical tools needed to detect compensatory evolution and coordinated selection across two genomes with vastly different properties remain underdeveloped.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the explosion of genomic data provides unprecedented opportunities to analyze mitonuclear evolution across thousands of species, from protists to plants to animals. Public databases now contain complete mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, population-level variation data, gene expression profiles, and protein interaction networks for diverse taxa. Second, advances in computational biology enable sophisticated analyses of coevolution, including detection of epistatic interactions, compensatory mutations, and coordinated selection that were previously intractable. Third, the biomedical relevance of mitonuclear interactions is increasingly recognized, with implications for personalized medicine, mitochondrial replacement therapy, and understanding complex diseases. Fourth, conservation biology faces urgent challenges related to mitonuclear incompatibilities in hybrid populations and fragmented habitats, requiring predictive frameworks. Finally, this project addresses fundamental questions about organellar evolution, genome architecture, and the maintenance of genetic systems that are central to cellular and molecular biology but require integration across traditionally separate disciplines. By synthesizing existing data through collaborative, transdisciplinary approaches, we can transform scattered observations into comprehensive understanding of one of evolution's most important partnerships.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and clear predictions that will advance our understanding of mitonuclear coevolution.

Research Question 1: What are the universal patterns and lineage-specific features of mitonuclear coevolution across eukaryotes? We hypothesize that while some coevolutionary mechanisms are conserved across all eukaryotes due to fundamental biochemical constraints, others vary among lineages due to differences in life history, population structure, and inheritance patterns. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) genes encoding subunits of the electron transport chain complexes will show stronger signatures of compensatory evolution than other mitochondrial-nuclear gene pairs across all taxa; (H1b) lineages with biparental mitochondrial inheritance will exhibit different coevolutionary dynamics than those with strict maternal inheritance; (H1c) taxa with larger effective population sizes will show more efficient purging of mildly deleterious mitonuclear incompatibilities. We will test these hypotheses by conducting phylogenetically-controlled comparative analyses across at least 50 eukaryotic lineages spanning protists, fungi, plants, and animals, examining rates of molecular evolution, signatures of selection, and patterns of compensatory substitutions.

Research Question 2: How do compensatory mutations maintain mitonuclear compatibility, and can we predict which mutations require compensation? We hypothesize that compensatory evolution follows predictable patterns based on protein structure, interaction interfaces, and functional constraints. Our predictions include: (H2a) mutations in mitochondrial-encoded proteins that alter residues at physical interaction interfaces with nuclear-encoded partners will be more likely to have compensatory mutations in nuclear genes; (H2b) the time lag between a mitochondrial mutation and its nuclear compensatory mutation correlates with the fitness cost of the incompatibility; (H2c) compensatory mutations cluster in specific functional domains and show convergent evolution across independent lineages. We will test these hypotheses by developing machine learning algorithms trained on known compensatory mutation pairs, validated through structural modeling of protein complexes, and applied to detect novel compensatory evolution across our dataset. Success will be measured by our ability to predict experimentally-validated incompatibilities from sequence data alone.

Research Question 3: How does mitonuclear coevolution constrain or facilitate evolutionary innovation and adaptation? We hypothesize that mitonuclear interactions create both constraints and opportunities for evolution. Specifically: (H3a) lineages with higher rates of mitochondrial evolution will show corresponding acceleration in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, but this will constrain diversification rates; (H3b) episodes of rapid environmental change will be associated with coordinated selection on mitonuclear gene sets; (H3c) gene duplication events in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes will be more likely to be retained when they provide flexibility for maintaining compatibility with diverse mitochondrial backgrounds. We will test these hypotheses by integrating phylogenomic analyses with environmental data, examining diversification rates in relation to mitonuclear evolutionary dynamics, and analyzing the fates of duplicated genes across lineages.

Research Question 4: What are the molecular signatures and functional consequences of mitonuclear incompatibilities in hybrid zones and disease states? We hypothesize that incompatibilities arise through predictable molecular mechanisms that can be detected in sequence and expression data. Our predictions include: (H4a) hybrid breakdown in natural populations correlates with specific mitonuclear genotype combinations that show expression dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes; (H4b) human mitochondrial variants associated with disease risk show population-specific effects due to nuclear genetic background differences; (H4c) mitonuclear incompatibilities manifest as stoichiometric imbalances in protein complex assembly and altered metabolic flux. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing population genomic data from hybrid zones across multiple species, integrating human mitochondrial disease databases with population-specific nuclear genome data, and examining gene expression coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.

Expected outcomes include: (1) a comprehensive catalog of mitonuclear gene pairs under coordinated selection across eukaryotes; (2) validated computational tools for predicting compensatory mutations and compatibility; (3) quantitative models of how mitonuclear interactions influence evolutionary rates and constraints; (4) identification of specific mitonuclear incompatibilities contributing to hybrid breakdown and disease; (5) publicly available databases and analysis workflows enabling the research community to explore mitonuclear evolution in any system. Each hypothesis will be validated through multiple independent approaches, including phylogenetic analyses, population genetic tests, structural modeling, and comparison with experimental data from the literature. The integration of predictions across multiple hypotheses will provide robust tests of our overall framework for understanding mitonuclear coevolution.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types and analytical methods, organized into four interconnected work packages that address our research questions. The project will span three years with specific milestones and deliverables.

Work Package 1: Data Integration and Database Construction (Months 1-9). We will compile and standardize data from multiple public sources. Genomic data will be obtained from NCBI GenBank (mitochondrial and nuclear genomes for >5,000 species), Ensembl (annotated genomes for model organisms), and the 1000 Genomes Project (human population variation). Population genomic datasets will be sourced from PopFly, DrosRTEC, 1001 Genomes (Arabidopsis), and published studies with data in NCBI SRA. Gene expression data will be compiled from GEO, ArrayExpress, and GTEx (human tissues). Protein interaction data will be obtained from STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct databases. Mitochondrial disease associations will be compiled from MITOMAP, ClinVar, and published GWAS studies. We will develop a relational database architecture linking mitochondrial genomes, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (identified through MitoCarta and ortholog mapping), protein interactions, expression profiles, and population variation. Quality control procedures will standardize annotations, identify orthologs using reciprocal best BLAST and phylogenetic approaches, and ensure data completeness. Deliverable: MitoNuclear Coevolution Database (MNCD) with web interface for community access.

Work Package 2: Phylogenomic and Comparative Analyses (Months 6-18). We will conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses to identify patterns of mitonuclear coevolution. First, we will construct species phylogenies using nuclear genome data and mitochondrial phylogenies, comparing topologies to identify cytonuclear discordance. Second, we will estimate evolutionary rates (dN/dS ratios) for all mitochondrial genes and their nuclear-encoded interaction partners across the phylogeny using PAML and HyPhy. Third, we will test for correlated evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genes using phylogenetically independent contrasts and Bayesian approaches implemented in BayesTraits. Fourth, we will identify compensatory mutations using several complementary methods: mirror tree approaches comparing distance matrices of interacting proteins, coevolution analysis using CAPS and EVcoupling, and explicit detection of epistatic substitutions using phylogenetic methods. Fifth, we will map mutations onto protein structures (obtained from PDB and AlphaFold predictions) to determine whether compensatory changes occur at interaction interfaces. Statistical significance will be assessed using permutation tests and phylogenetic simulations. We will conduct separate analyses for major taxonomic groups and test for differences in coevolutionary patterns using phylogenetic ANOVA. Deliverable: Comprehensive catalog of mitonuclear gene pairs showing coordinated evolution, compensatory mutation database, and analytical pipeline for detecting coevolution.

Work Package 3: Population Genomic and Expression Analyses (Months 12-24). We will analyze population-level variation to understand contemporary mitonuclear dynamics. First, we will characterize mitochondrial haplotype diversity and nuclear genetic variation at mitochondrial-targeted genes across populations. Second, we will test for mitonuclear linkage disequilibrium and epistatic fitness effects using association mapping approaches. Third, we will identify signatures of coordinated selection using extended haplotype homozygosity tests and composite likelihood methods. Fourth, we will analyze gene expression data to quantify coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression across tissues, developmental stages, and environmental conditions using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression approaches. Fifth, we will examine stoichiometric balance of protein complex subunits using expression data and test whether mitonuclear incompatibilities manifest as expression imbalances. For hybrid zone analyses, we will identify mitonuclear genotype combinations associated with reduced fitness using genomic cline analyses and test for expression dysregulation in hybrids. For human disease associations, we will test for interactions between mitochondrial variants and nuclear genetic backgrounds using logistic regression models controlling for population structure. Deliverable: Population-specific mitonuclear compatibility maps, expression coordination networks, and disease risk prediction models.

Work Package 4: Predictive Modeling and Tool Development (Months 18-36). We will develop computational tools for predicting mitonuclear compatibility and detecting compensatory evolution. First, we will train machine learning models (random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning approaches) to predict compensatory mutations using features including evolutionary rates, structural properties, expression patterns, and interaction network topology. Training data will include validated compensatory mutations from our phylogenomic analyses and experimental literature. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and independent test sets. Second, we will develop compatibility prediction tools that integrate sequence, structure, and expression data to assess whether specific mitonuclear combinations are likely to be functional. These will be validated against experimental data on hybrid fitness and disease associations. Third, we will create user-friendly software packages and web interfaces enabling researchers to apply our methods to new species and datasets. All tools will be open-source, well-documented, and include tutorial datasets. Deliverable: Software suite for mitonuclear coevolution analysis, compatibility prediction tools, and comprehensive documentation.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 - Database construction complete (Month 9), initial phylogenomic analyses (Month 12); Year 2 - Comparative analyses across major lineages (Month 18), population genomic analyses (Month 24); Year 3 - Predictive model development (Month 30), tool validation and dissemination (Month 36). The project will include quarterly virtual meetings, two in-person working group meetings (Months 12 and 24), and annual training workshops for graduate students and postdocs.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes across multiple dimensions, advancing fundamental knowledge while providing practical tools and training opportunities.

Scientific Contributions: The project will resolve long-standing questions about mitonuclear coevolution by providing the first comprehensive, quantitative framework spanning the diversity of eukaryotic life. We will establish universal principles governing how two genomes with vastly different properties maintain functional compatibility, while identifying lineage-specific adaptations. The catalog of compensatory mutations will reveal the molecular mechanisms by which evolution solves the compatibility problem, informing theories of molecular evolution, epistasis, and genetic constraints. By quantifying how mitonuclear interactions influence evolutionary rates and diversification, we will advance understanding of macroevolutionary patterns. The identification of specific incompatibilities in hybrid zones will provide concrete examples of genetic mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation and speciation. For human health, linking mitochondrial variants to nuclear genetic backgrounds will enable more precise understanding of disease susceptibility and potentially inform personalized medicine approaches. These contributions will be disseminated through high-impact publications in journals such as Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS, Molecular Biology and Evolution, and PLoS Biology, with separate papers addressing each major research question plus methods papers describing our computational approaches.

Database and Tool Resources: The MitoNuclear Coevolution Database (MNCD) will become a community resource analogous to successful databases like FlyBase or TAIR, providing centralized access to integrated mitonuclear data across thousands of species. The database will include interactive visualization tools, allowing researchers to explore coevolutionary patterns in their study systems. Our software suite for detecting compensatory evolution and predicting compatibility will enable researchers to apply these approaches to new species, populations, or clinical datasets. These tools will be particularly valuable for conservation biologists assessing risks of outbreeding depression, evolutionary biologists studying adaptation and speciation, and biomedical researchers investigating mitochondrial diseases. All resources will be maintained beyond the project period through partnerships with established bioinformatics centers and will follow FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We will deposit all analysis workflows in repositories like GitHub and WorkflowHub, ensuring reproducibility and enabling community contributions.

Broader Impacts: This project addresses societal challenges in health and conservation. Understanding mitonuclear interactions has direct relevance to mitochondrial diseases affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals, potentially informing therapeutic strategies and genetic counseling. For conservation, our compatibility prediction tools will help assess risks when managing small or fragmented populations where mitonuclear mismatches may arise. The project will advance open science practices by making all data, code, and workflows publicly available, serving as a model for synthesis research. Our commitment to transparency includes pre-registration of analyses, version-controlled code repositories, and detailed documentation of all methods.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train the next generation of data-savvy scientists through multiple mechanisms. We will support 6-8 graduate students and postdocs as working group members, providing hands-on experience in collaborative, interdisciplinary research. Annual training workshops (5 days each) will teach 20-25 trainees per year skills in phylogenomics, population genomics, machine learning, and data integration. Workshop materials will be made publicly available as online courses. We will prioritize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with diversity-focused programs. Trainees will gain experience in team science, develop professional networks spanning disciplines, and acquire computational skills highly valued in both academic and industry careers. We will track trainee outcomes and career trajectories to assess long-term impacts.

Follow-up Research and Sustainability: This synthesis project will catalyze numerous follow-up studies. The hypotheses generated about specific compensatory mutations can be tested experimentally through genome editing approaches. The identification of mitonuclear incompatibilities in natural populations will motivate field studies examining fitness consequences. The disease associations will suggest clinical studies and therapeutic targets. We will actively foster these connections by organizing symposia at major conferences (SMBE, Evolution, ASCB) and publishing perspective pieces highlighting research opportunities. The database and tools will be sustained through institutional support and potential future funding for maintenance and expansion. We envision MNCD becoming a dynamic resource that grows with community contributions, similar to successful community databases. The interdisciplinary networks established will persist beyond the project, potentially leading to new collaborative grants and research programs. Ultimately, this synthesis will establish mitonuclear coevolution as a mature research field with standardized methods, comprehensive data resources, and clear frameworks for future investigation.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_claude_07,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,claude-sonnet-4-5,The Allosteric Code: Deciphering Long-Range Communication Networks in Proteins,"Allostery—the transmission of regulatory signals across protein structures—is fundamental to cellular regulation, yet we lack predictive understanding of how structural changes propagate through proteins. This synthesis project will integrate protein structural databases (PDB, AlphaFold), molecular dynamics simulations, mutational scanning data, and functional assays to decode the principles of allosteric communication. By assembling structural biologists, biophysicists, computational chemists, and machine learning experts, we will analyze thousands of protein structures to identify conserved pathways for signal transmission and develop predictive models for allosteric effects. The project will synthesize experimental structures, computational predictions, deep mutational scanning datasets, and NMR dynamics data to map allosteric networks across protein fold families. We will apply network analysis, perturbation theory, and deep learning to identify residues critical for signal transmission and predict how mutations disrupt allostery in disease. This addresses the fundamental question of how proteins encode regulatory information in their structures beyond active sites. The collaborative framework is essential because it requires integration of structural data, dynamics simulations, experimental validation datasets, and advanced computational methods that span multiple disciplines. Outputs will include an allosteric pathway database, prediction tools for identifying allosteric sites and mutations, standardized analysis protocols, and training workshops in integrative structural biology. This resource will enable rational design of allosteric drugs and deepen understanding of protein regulation mechanisms.",,"Background And Significance

Allostery represents one of the most elegant and ubiquitous regulatory mechanisms in biology, enabling proteins to respond to signals at one site by inducing functional changes at distant locations. First described by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux in 1965, allostery governs fundamental cellular processes including signal transduction, metabolic regulation, gene expression, and immune responses. Despite six decades of research, our understanding of allosteric mechanisms remains largely phenomenological, with limited predictive power for identifying allosteric sites or anticipating the functional consequences of mutations. This knowledge gap has profound implications for both basic biology and translational medicine, as approximately 40% of disease-associated mutations affect protein function through allosteric disruption rather than direct active site perturbation.

The classical view of allostery emphasized conformational changes between discrete structural states, exemplified by hemoglobin's cooperative oxygen binding. However, recent advances in structural biology, biophysics, and computational chemistry have revealed that allostery operates through diverse mechanisms including dynamic fluctuations, entropic redistribution, and subtle conformational shifts that may not be apparent in static structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has demonstrated that proteins exist as ensembles of interconverting conformations, with allosteric signals propagating through shifts in these conformational populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have identified networks of correlated motions connecting distant protein regions, suggesting that allostery exploits pre-existing communication pathways encoded in protein architecture. Deep mutational scanning experiments have revealed that mutations throughout protein structures can affect function, indicating widespread allosteric coupling beyond traditionally recognized regulatory domains.

Despite these advances, several critical gaps limit our understanding of allosteric mechanisms. First, we lack comprehensive maps of allosteric pathways across protein fold families, making it difficult to identify general principles versus family-specific features. Second, existing computational methods for predicting allosteric sites show limited accuracy and often disagree with experimental observations. Third, the relationship between protein dynamics, evolutionary conservation, and allosteric function remains poorly understood. Fourth, we cannot reliably predict how specific mutations will affect allosteric communication, hampering efforts to interpret disease variants and engineer proteins with desired regulatory properties. Finally, the field lacks standardized datasets, analysis protocols, and benchmarking frameworks for comparing different computational approaches.

The timing is ideal for a comprehensive synthesis project addressing these gaps. The Protein Data Bank now contains over 200,000 structures, including thousands of proteins captured in multiple conformational states. AlphaFold has generated structure predictions for nearly all known proteins, providing unprecedented coverage of protein structure space. Deep mutational scanning studies have systematically characterized functional effects of mutations in hundreds of proteins, creating rich datasets for validating allosteric predictions. Molecular dynamics simulations have accumulated petabytes of trajectory data in repositories like GPCRmd and MoDEL. Advanced machine learning methods, particularly graph neural networks and transformer architectures, offer powerful tools for identifying patterns in complex structural data. These resources, previously scattered across disciplines and databases, can now be integrated to address fundamental questions about allosteric communication.

This synthesis project is significant for multiple reasons. Scientifically, it addresses the fundamental question of how proteins encode regulatory information in their three-dimensional structures, moving beyond the sequence-structure-function paradigm to incorporate dynamics and long-range coupling. Methodologically, it will establish frameworks for integrating heterogeneous data types—static structures, dynamic simulations, evolutionary information, and functional measurements—to generate mechanistic insights. Practically, understanding allosteric mechanisms will enable rational design of allosteric drugs, which offer advantages over active-site inhibitors including greater specificity, reduced toxicity, and ability to modulate rather than abolish protein function. The project will also train a new generation of researchers in integrative structural biology, equipping them with skills in data science, structural analysis, and collaborative research essential for modern molecular biology. By creating open-access databases, prediction tools, and standardized protocols, this project will establish infrastructure benefiting the entire structural biology community and accelerating discovery in protein science.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project will address four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to decode the principles governing allosteric communication in proteins.

Research Question 1: What are the structural and dynamic features that define allosteric pathways in proteins? We hypothesize that allosteric communication occurs through conserved networks of residues that exhibit correlated motions, evolutionary co-variation, and specific structural connectivity patterns. We predict that these pathways will be identifiable through integration of structural analysis (contact networks, geometric parameters), dynamic information (molecular dynamics correlations, NMR relaxation data), and evolutionary signals (co-evolution analysis, conservation patterns). We expect to find that allosteric pathways are not uniformly distributed but concentrate along specific structural elements such as secondary structure interfaces, domain boundaries, and hinge regions. Testing this hypothesis will involve systematic analysis of proteins with known allosteric mechanisms, comparing pathway features between functional and non-functional variants, and validating predictions against experimental mutagenesis data. We will quantify pathway robustness by examining how structural perturbations propagate through identified networks and whether alternative pathways exist for signal transmission.

Research Question 2: Are there universal principles of allosteric communication that transcend protein fold families, or is allostery primarily fold-specific? We hypothesize that while specific residues and pathways vary across protein families, general organizational principles govern allosteric communication across all proteins. These principles may include: (1) hierarchical organization where local perturbations propagate through intermediate relay stations to distant sites; (2) exploitation of intrinsic protein dynamics where allosteric signals modulate pre-existing conformational fluctuations; (3) energetic coupling through networks of weak interactions rather than single strong connections; and (4) redundancy where multiple pathways provide robustness against mutations. We predict that machine learning models trained on diverse protein families will identify these universal features, enabling cross-family predictions. Testing will involve training models on specific fold families and evaluating their performance on unrelated folds, comparing pathway architectures across evolutionarily distant proteins with analogous functions, and examining whether engineered allosteric switches in one fold family follow principles derived from others.

Research Question 3: How do disease-associated mutations disrupt allosteric communication, and can we predict pathogenic allosteric effects? We hypothesize that pathogenic mutations disrupt allostery through distinct mechanisms including: (1) breaking critical pathway connections by altering residue contacts; (2) rigidifying or over-stabilizing structures to prevent conformational transitions; (3) introducing competing interactions that redirect signal flow; and (4) destabilizing protein structures to eliminate functional conformations. We predict that integrating structural context, dynamic properties, and evolutionary constraints will enable accurate classification of mutations as pathway-disrupting versus benign. Specifically, we expect that mutations at evolutionarily conserved positions within identified allosteric pathways will show stronger functional effects than mutations at equally conserved positions outside pathways. Testing will involve analyzing thousands of disease variants from ClinVar and other databases, correlating predicted pathway disruption with clinical phenotypes, and validating predictions against deep mutational scanning datasets that systematically measure functional effects.

Research Question 4: Can we develop generalizable computational tools for predicting allosteric sites and designing allosteric modulators? We hypothesize that integration of multiple data types—structure, dynamics, evolution, and function—through machine learning will enable accurate prediction of allosteric sites and mutation effects. We predict that graph neural networks operating on protein structure networks will outperform sequence-based or structure-only methods by capturing both local geometry and long-range connectivity. We expect that models incorporating dynamic information will show improved performance over static structure-based approaches, particularly for proteins where allostery involves conformational selection or population shifts. Testing will involve rigorous benchmarking against experimental datasets, including blind predictions on newly characterized allosteric proteins, cross-validation across protein families, and comparison with existing computational methods. Success will be measured by precision and recall for allosteric site prediction, correlation between predicted and measured mutation effects, and ability to identify cryptic allosteric sites not apparent from structure alone.

Expected outcomes include: (1) comprehensive maps of allosteric pathways for major protein fold families; (2) quantitative models relating structural features to allosteric coupling strength; (3) validated computational tools for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects; (4) mechanistic understanding of how different protein architectures implement allosteric regulation; (5) design principles for engineering allosteric control into proteins; and (6) curated databases linking structures, pathways, mutations, and functional effects. These outcomes will be validated through comparison with experimental data, cross-validation across datasets, and prospective predictions on newly characterized systems.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse data sources and analytical methods through a collaborative framework involving structural biologists, biophysicists, computational chemists, and machine learning experts. The project is organized into five interconnected phases over a three-year timeline.

Phase 1: Data Collection and Curation (Months 1-6). We will compile comprehensive datasets from multiple public repositories. Structural data will be obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), focusing on proteins with multiple conformational states (>15,000 structures), and AlphaFold Database predictions (>200 million structures). We will extract proteins with experimentally validated allosteric mechanisms from literature curation and databases including ASD (Allosteric Database), ASBench, and CASBench. Molecular dynamics trajectories will be collected from GPCRmd, MoDEL, and DESRES repositories, supplemented by targeted simulations on representative proteins from each major fold family. Deep mutational scanning data will be compiled from published studies and repositories including ProteinGym and MaveDB, focusing on proteins with known allosteric mechanisms. NMR dynamics data including relaxation parameters, chemical shift perturbations, and hydrogen-exchange rates will be extracted from BMRB and literature. Evolutionary information will be obtained through multiple sequence alignments from Pfam, InterPro, and custom alignments generated using HHblits. Disease variant data will be compiled from ClinVar, COSMIC, and UniProt, focusing on variants with functional characterization. All datasets will be standardized, quality-controlled, and integrated into a unified database with consistent identifiers and metadata.

Phase 2: Structural and Dynamic Analysis (Months 4-12). For each protein structure, we will construct residue interaction networks where nodes represent amino acids and edges represent physical contacts, with edge weights reflecting interaction strength. Network analysis will identify communities (densely connected regions), betweenness centrality (residues connecting distant regions), and shortest paths between functional sites. We will calculate geometric parameters including inter-residue distances, angles, and solvent accessibility across conformational states to quantify structural changes. Molecular dynamics trajectories will be analyzed using dynamic cross-correlation matrices to identify residues with correlated motions, principal component analysis to extract dominant motions, and mutual information to quantify coupling between residues. Perturbation response scanning will computationally predict how local perturbations propagate through structures. Evolutionary coupling analysis using methods like EVcouplings and Gremlin will identify co-evolving residue pairs indicating functional constraints. Integration of structural networks with dynamic correlations and evolutionary couplings will generate comprehensive allosteric pathway maps. This phase will be led by structural biologists and biophysicists with expertise in protein dynamics.

Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development (Months 10-20). We will develop multiple complementary computational approaches for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects. Graph neural networks will operate on protein structure graphs, learning representations that capture both local geometry and global topology. Input features will include residue type, structural properties (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, B-factors), dynamic properties (flexibility, correlation with other residues), and evolutionary information (conservation, co-evolution). Transformer-based models will process protein sequences with structural and dynamic annotations to predict allosteric residues and pathways. Ensemble methods will combine predictions from multiple models to improve robustness. Models will be trained on curated datasets with known allosteric sites and validated mutations, using cross-validation within protein families and testing on held-out families to assess generalizability. For mutation effect prediction, we will develop models that take wild-type and mutant structures (or predictions) as input and predict functional consequences. Feature importance analysis will identify which structural and dynamic properties most strongly predict allosteric behavior, providing mechanistic insights. This phase will be led by machine learning experts and computational chemists.

Phase 4: Integration and Validation (Months 18-30). We will integrate findings across protein families to identify universal principles versus family-specific features. Comparative analysis will examine whether pathway architectures, residue properties, and coupling mechanisms differ systematically across fold types, protein sizes, or functional classes. Rigorous validation will compare predictions against multiple experimental datasets including: (1) newly published allosteric proteins not in training data; (2) deep mutational scanning results for quantitative mutation effects; (3) NMR chemical shift perturbations mapping signal propagation; (4) hydrogen-deuterium exchange data revealing conformational changes; and (5) disease variants with clinical phenotypes. Statistical analysis will quantify prediction accuracy, identify failure modes, and guide model refinement. We will also perform case studies on medically important proteins (kinases, GPCRs, transcription factors) to demonstrate practical applications. This phase involves the entire collaborative team.

Phase 5: Tool Development and Dissemination (Months 24-36). We will create publicly accessible resources including: (1) AlloPathDB, a database of allosteric pathways with interactive visualization; (2) AlloPredict, a web server for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects; (3) standardized analysis protocols and software packages for pathway identification; and (4) benchmark datasets for evaluating new methods. Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and training workshops will ensure community adoption. All code will be open-source and deposited in GitHub repositories. Results will be published in high-impact journals and presented at conferences. We will organize a symposium bringing together experimental and computational researchers to discuss findings and future directions.

Timeline Milestones: Month 6 - Complete data curation; Month 12 - Pathway maps for 50 protein families; Month 18 - Initial machine learning models; Month 24 - Validated prediction tools; Month 30 - Complete cross-family analysis; Month 36 - Public release of all resources and final publications. The collaborative framework is essential because no single lab possesses expertise in structural biology, molecular dynamics, machine learning, and experimental validation required for this integrative project.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes advancing both fundamental understanding of protein allostery and practical applications in drug discovery and protein engineering.

Scientific Contributions: The project will produce the first comprehensive atlas of allosteric pathways across major protein fold families, revealing how different structural architectures implement long-range communication. By analyzing thousands of proteins, we will identify universal principles governing allosteric signal transmission, including the structural features, dynamic properties, and evolutionary constraints that define functional pathways. This will fundamentally advance our understanding of how proteins encode regulatory information beyond active sites, addressing a central question in molecular biology. The integration of static structures with dynamic information will demonstrate that allostery cannot be fully understood from structures alone, establishing dynamics as an essential component of protein function. Our analysis of disease mutations will reveal how genetic variants disrupt allosteric communication, providing mechanistic insights into molecular pathogenesis and explaining why mutations distant from active sites can abolish function. The project will also establish quantitative relationships between structural perturbations and functional consequences, moving the field from qualitative descriptions toward predictive models.

Methodological Advances: We will develop and validate computational tools that significantly outperform existing methods for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects. These tools will integrate multiple data types—structure, dynamics, evolution, and function—through advanced machine learning approaches, demonstrating the power of data synthesis for addressing complex biological questions. The standardized analysis protocols and benchmark datasets will enable rigorous comparison of different computational approaches, accelerating methodological development across the field. Our framework for integrating heterogeneous data sources will serve as a model for other synthesis projects in structural biology and beyond. The machine learning models will be interpretable, revealing which features most strongly predict allosteric behavior and thereby generating mechanistic hypotheses testable through experiments.

Practical Applications: Understanding allosteric mechanisms will enable rational design of allosteric drugs, which offer significant advantages over traditional active-site inhibitors. Allosteric modulators can achieve greater specificity by targeting regulatory sites unique to specific protein family members, reduce toxicity by modulating rather than abolishing protein function, and overcome resistance mechanisms that affect active sites. Our prediction tools will identify cryptic allosteric sites not apparent from structure inspection, expanding the druggable proteome. The ability to predict mutation effects will improve interpretation of genetic variants in clinical settings, distinguishing pathogenic from benign variants and guiding personalized medicine approaches. For protein engineering, our design principles will enable introduction of allosteric control into enzymes and other proteins, creating biosensors, controllable therapeutics, and optimized industrial biocatalysts.

Community Resources: The project will deliver multiple open-access resources benefiting the broader scientific community. AlloPathDB will provide a centralized repository of allosteric pathway information with interactive visualization tools, enabling researchers to explore communication networks in their proteins of interest. AlloPredict will offer user-friendly web interfaces for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects without requiring computational expertise. Standardized datasets and protocols will facilitate method development and benchmarking. All software will be open-source with comprehensive documentation, and training workshops will build community capacity in integrative structural biology approaches. These resources will be maintained beyond the project period through partnerships with established bioinformatics centers.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in integrative approaches combining structural biology, biophysics, computational chemistry, and data science—skills increasingly essential for modern molecular biology research. Trainees will gain experience in collaborative, team-based science and learn to work across disciplinary boundaries. We will organize annual workshops providing hands-on training in data synthesis methods, reaching researchers beyond the immediate project team. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research infrastructure, promoting diversity in the scientific workforce.

Dissemination Strategy: Results will be published in high-impact journals including Nature, Science, Cell, and specialized journals like Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, PNAS, and eLife. We will publish multiple papers addressing different aspects: comprehensive pathway analysis, machine learning methods, disease mutation analysis, and specific case studies. All publications will be open-access to maximize accessibility. Preprints will be posted on bioRxiv immediately upon completion. We will present findings at major conferences including Biophysical Society, Protein Society, and RECOMB. A dedicated project website will provide regular updates, tutorials, and community forums. We will engage with pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms to facilitate translation of findings into drug discovery applications.

Long-term Vision: This project will establish allostery as a central organizing principle in protein biology, comparable to the genetic code or protein folding principles. The resources and methods developed will enable a new generation of studies examining allosteric regulation in diverse biological contexts including signal transduction, metabolic regulation, and cellular decision-making. The framework for data synthesis will be applicable to other fundamental questions in molecular biology. We envision follow-up projects examining allosteric regulation in protein complexes, intrinsically disordered proteins, and membrane proteins. The prediction tools will be continuously updated as new data becomes available, ensuring sustained impact. Ultimately, this project will transform our ability to understand, predict, and manipulate protein regulation, with far-reaching implications for biology and medicine.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_claude_08,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,claude-sonnet-4-5,Chromatin Architecture Across the Tree of Life: Universal Principles and Lineage-Specific Innovations,"Chromatin organization is central to gene regulation in eukaryotes, yet comparative analyses across diverse lineages remain limited, obscuring universal principles and evolutionary innovations. This synthesis project will integrate Hi-C, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and genomic data from diverse eukaryotes—from protists to mammals—to understand how chromatin architecture evolved and identify conserved organizational principles. By uniting chromatin biologists, evolutionary biologists, computational biologists, and comparative genomicists, we will analyze 3D genome organization across phylogenetic space to determine which features are ancestral and which represent lineage-specific adaptations. The project will synthesize data from ENCODE, modENCODE, 4D Nucleome, and organism-specific databases to address fundamental questions: When did TADs, compartments, and loops evolve? How do different organisms achieve transcriptional regulation through chromatin? What constraints shape genome organization? We will develop comparative frameworks to align chromatin features across divergent genomes, identify conserved architectural proteins and their binding motifs, and correlate organizational changes with regulatory innovations. This requires integration of 3D genomics data, phylogenetic methods, and comparative analyses at scales beyond individual laboratories. Deliverables include a comparative chromatin architecture atlas, tools for cross-species chromatin analysis, curated datasets of orthologous regulatory elements, and interdisciplinary training programs. This work will reveal fundamental principles of genome organization and provide evolutionary context for understanding human chromatin biology and disease.",,"Background And Significance

Chromatin organization represents one of the most fundamental mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression, DNA replication, and genome stability. The three-dimensional architecture of chromatin creates functional compartments that bring regulatory elements into proximity with their target genes while insulating other regions from inappropriate interactions. Over the past two decades, chromosome conformation capture technologies, particularly Hi-C, have revolutionized our understanding of genome organization in model organisms, revealing hierarchical structures including chromosome territories, A/B compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops. These discoveries have primarily focused on mammalian systems, with landmark studies from the ENCODE and 4D Nucleome consortia establishing that disruption of chromatin architecture contributes to developmental disorders and cancer.

Despite these advances, our understanding of chromatin organization remains heavily biased toward a narrow phylogenetic range. The vast majority of 3D genome studies have examined mammals, with additional work in Drosophila, C. elegans, and a handful of plant species through modENCODE and related efforts. This taxonomic sampling represents less than 0.01% of eukaryotic diversity, leaving fundamental questions unanswered about the evolutionary origins and conservation of chromatin organizational principles. Recent studies have revealed surprising diversity: while mammalian genomes display prominent TADs mediated by CTCF and cohesin, Drosophila shows weaker domain structures, C. elegans lacks clear TADs entirely, and plants exhibit unique chromatin features associated with their sessile lifestyle. These observations suggest that chromatin architecture may be more evolutionarily plastic than previously assumed, yet systematic comparative analyses across deep evolutionary time remain absent.

The significance of understanding chromatin evolution extends beyond academic curiosity. First, identifying truly conserved features of genome organization would reveal fundamental constraints and principles that govern all eukaryotic life, distinguishing universal requirements from lineage-specific adaptations. Second, evolutionary context is essential for interpreting human chromatin biology and disease mechanisms—features that appear essential in mammals may represent recent innovations rather than ancient requirements. Third, diverse organisms have evolved distinct solutions to common regulatory challenges, and understanding these alternatives could inspire novel therapeutic approaches and biotechnological applications. Fourth, many emerging model organisms and species of agricultural, ecological, or biomedical importance lack chromatin architecture data, limiting our ability to develop genetic tools and understand their unique biology.

Several critical gaps impede progress in comparative chromatin biology. First, existing datasets are scattered across multiple repositories with inconsistent formats, quality standards, and metadata, making systematic comparison extremely challenging. Second, computational tools for chromatin analysis were developed for specific model organisms and often fail when applied to divergent species with different genome sizes, repeat contents, or chromosomal organizations. Third, identifying orthologous regulatory elements and architectural proteins across large evolutionary distances requires sophisticated phylogenetic and synteny analyses that integrate multiple data types. Fourth, no comprehensive framework exists for quantifying and comparing chromatin features across species while accounting for technical variation and biological differences in genome structure.

This synthesis project addresses these gaps by leveraging the explosion of publicly available chromatin data from diverse eukaryotes. Recent years have seen Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq datasets published for protists, fungi, plants, and numerous animal lineages, creating an unprecedented opportunity for comparative analysis. However, synthesizing these data requires expertise spanning chromatin biology, evolutionary genomics, computational biology, and comparative methods—a truly transdisciplinary effort beyond the scope of individual laboratories. The timing is ideal: sufficient taxonomic sampling now exists to address evolutionary questions, computational resources can handle genome-scale comparisons, and the field recognizes the need for evolutionary perspectives on genome organization. This project will transform scattered datasets into integrated knowledge, revealing how chromatin architecture evolved and establishing principles that govern genome organization across all eukaryotic life.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will fundamentally advance our understanding of chromatin evolution and genome organization.

Research Question 1: What are the ancestral and derived features of eukaryotic chromatin architecture? We hypothesize that while specific organizational structures like TADs show lineage-specific variation, fundamental principles of compartmentalization and loop formation represent ancestral features present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). We predict that: (a) A/B compartmentalization correlating with active/inactive chromatin will be universal across eukaryotes, as it reflects fundamental biophysical properties of chromatin states; (b) Contact enrichment between regulatory elements and promoters will be conserved, though the proteins mediating these interactions may differ; (c) Insulation between chromatin domains will be present across eukaryotes but achieved through diverse molecular mechanisms; (d) TAD-like structures will correlate with the presence of specific architectural proteins (CTCF, condensins, cohesins) and their evolutionary history. We will test these hypotheses by systematically analyzing Hi-C data across 50+ species spanning major eukaryotic supergroups, identifying shared organizational features using phylogenetically-informed comparative methods, and correlating architectural features with the presence/absence of candidate architectural proteins identified through comparative genomics.

Research Question 2: How do architectural proteins and their binding sites evolve, and how does this evolution shape genome organization? We hypothesize that while specific DNA-binding proteins like CTCF show limited phylogenetic distribution, functionally analogous proteins with convergent roles exist across eukaryotes, and that binding site evolution constrains organizational plasticity. Our predictions include: (a) Architectural protein families will show birth-and-death evolution with lineage-specific expansions correlating with organizational complexity; (b) Binding motifs for architectural proteins will be enriched at domain boundaries across species, even when the proteins themselves are not orthologous; (c) Syntenic regions will maintain similar organizational features despite sequence divergence when architectural protein binding is conserved; (d) Loss of architectural proteins will correlate with alternative organizational mechanisms. We will test these hypotheses by performing comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of architectural protein families, identifying binding motifs through ChIP-seq data integration and de novo motif discovery, correlating motif presence with boundary positions across species, and analyzing organizational changes in lineages that have lost specific architectural proteins.

Research Question 3: What evolutionary forces and genomic constraints shape chromatin architecture? We hypothesize that genome organization reflects optimization under multiple constraints including genome size, gene density, regulatory complexity, and life history traits. We predict: (a) Compact genomes will show stronger, more defined organizational structures due to increased regulatory density; (b) Gene-dense regions will exhibit more complex loop structures connecting dispersed regulatory elements; (c) Organisms with complex development will show more elaborate chromatin architectures than those with simpler life cycles; (d) Chromatin organization will correlate with transcriptional complexity, with more organizational layers in organisms with extensive alternative splicing and cell-type-specific regulation. These hypotheses will be tested through quantitative analyses correlating organizational metrics (TAD strength, loop frequency, compartment definition) with genomic features (size, gene density, repeat content), life history traits, and transcriptional complexity measures across our phylogenetic sampling.

Research Question 4: How do lineage-specific innovations in chromatin organization enable unique regulatory strategies? We hypothesize that major evolutionary transitions (multicellularity, complex development, environmental adaptation) are associated with chromatin organizational innovations that enable new regulatory capabilities. Predictions include: (a) Independent origins of multicellularity will correlate with convergent evolution of enhancer-promoter loop structures; (b) Lineages with extreme environmental adaptations will show unique chromatin features supporting rapid transcriptional responses; (c) Organisms with complex cell-type diversity will exhibit more hierarchical organizational structures; (d) Regulatory innovations like X-chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting will be associated with novel architectural features. We will test these hypotheses through detailed case studies of specific lineages, comparing chromatin organization before and after major transitions, identifying lineage-specific organizational features through phylogenetic comparative methods, and correlating organizational innovations with regulatory capabilities documented in the literature.

Expected outcomes include: quantitative metrics of organizational conservation and divergence across eukaryotes; identification of universal principles governing genome organization; evolutionary timelines for major architectural features; catalogs of architectural proteins and their binding sites across diverse species; predictive models linking genomic features to organizational properties; and mechanistic insights into how chromatin evolution enables regulatory innovation. These outcomes will be validated through consistency across multiple analytical approaches, agreement with experimental literature, and predictive power for species not included in initial analyses.

Methods And Approach

Our comprehensive analytical approach integrates multiple data types and computational methods to address chromatin architecture evolution across eukaryotes. The project is organized into five integrated phases over a three-year timeline.

Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Standardization (Months 1-6). We will systematically identify and acquire publicly available datasets from multiple repositories including ENCODE, modENCODE, 4D Nucleome, NCBI GEO, ENA, and organism-specific databases (e.g., WormBase, FlyBase, Phytozome, EnsemblGenomes). Target datasets include: Hi-C/Micro-C data from 50+ species spanning major eukaryotic supergroups (Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa, Archaeplastida, SAR, Excavata); ChIP-seq data for histone modifications and architectural proteins (CTCF, cohesin, condensin, HP1, Polycomb); ATAC-seq/DNase-seq for chromatin accessibility; RNA-seq for gene expression; and high-quality reference genomes with annotations. We will establish rigorous quality control criteria including sequencing depth thresholds (>100M read pairs for Hi-C), mapping quality metrics, and biological replicate requirements. All raw data will be reprocessed through standardized pipelines to eliminate technical batch effects: Hi-C data processed with HiC-Pro and Cooler for contact matrix generation; ChIP-seq analyzed with standard peak calling pipelines (MACS2, HOMER); ATAC-seq processed for accessibility peaks; RNA-seq quantified with Salmon/RSEM. Standardized outputs will be stored in common formats (cool/mcool for Hi-C, bigWig for coverage, BED for features) with comprehensive metadata following FAIR principles.

Phase 2: Comparative Chromatin Architecture Analysis (Months 7-15). We will develop and apply novel computational frameworks for cross-species comparison of chromatin features. For 3D organization, we will: identify TADs using multiple algorithms (Arrowhead, TopDom, HiCExplorer) to assess robustness; call A/B compartments through eigenvector decomposition; detect chromatin loops using HiCCUPS and FitHiC; quantify organizational metrics including insulation scores, directionality indices, and contact enrichment patterns. Critically, we will develop phylogenetically-aware comparison methods that account for evolutionary distance and technical variation. This includes: normalization procedures adjusting for genome size and sequencing depth; alignment of syntenic regions using whole-genome alignments and orthology information from Ensembl Compara and OrthoFinder; statistical frameworks for testing conservation using phylogenetic generalized least squares and phylogenetic ANOVA; and machine learning approaches (random forests, deep learning) to identify organizational features predictive of phylogenetic position or genomic properties. For each species, we will generate comprehensive organizational profiles including TAD size distributions, compartment strengths, loop frequencies, and boundary characteristics.

Phase 3: Architectural Protein Evolution and Binding Site Analysis (Months 10-20). We will conduct systematic evolutionary analyses of proteins implicated in chromatin organization. Using proteomes from all species in our dataset, we will: identify orthologs of known architectural proteins through reciprocal BLAST, HMMer searches, and phylogenetic tree construction; perform comprehensive phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to establish evolutionary relationships and identify gene duplications, losses, and innovations; analyze domain architectures to identify functional conservation and divergence; correlate protein presence/absence with organizational features using phylogenetic comparative methods. For binding site analysis, we will: integrate available ChIP-seq data to identify binding locations of architectural proteins; perform de novo motif discovery using MEME, HOMER, and deep learning approaches; map motifs to syntenic regions across species to assess conservation; correlate motif presence with organizational features like TAD boundaries and loop anchors; use machine learning to predict boundary positions from sequence features. This phase will produce comprehensive catalogs of architectural proteins across eukaryotes and their associated binding preferences.

Phase 4: Evolutionary Constraint and Innovation Analysis (Months 16-28). We will integrate organizational data with genomic features and life history traits to identify evolutionary forces shaping chromatin architecture. Analyses include: quantifying correlations between organizational metrics and genome properties (size, GC content, gene density, repeat content) using phylogenetic comparative methods; testing associations between organizational complexity and life history traits (developmental complexity, cell-type diversity, environmental variability) through phylogenetic regression; identifying lineage-specific innovations through ancestral state reconstruction and phylogenetic comparative methods; detecting convergent evolution of organizational features in independent lineages; analyzing organizational changes associated with major evolutionary transitions through detailed case studies. We will employ sophisticated statistical approaches including phylogenetic independent contrasts, phylogenetic generalized least squares, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to account for phylogenetic non-independence and test alternative evolutionary hypotheses.

Phase 5: Integration, Validation, and Resource Development (Months 24-36). Final phases focus on synthesis and resource creation. We will: integrate findings across analyses to identify universal principles and lineage-specific features; validate predictions through comparison with experimental literature and analysis of additional species not in the training set; develop user-friendly computational tools for cross-species chromatin comparison packaged as R/Python libraries and web interfaces; create a comprehensive Chromatin Architecture Atlas database with interactive visualization tools; curate datasets of orthologous regulatory elements and architectural protein binding sites; develop training materials including tutorials, workshops, and online courses. All code will be version-controlled on GitHub, documented, and released under open-source licenses. Data will be deposited in appropriate repositories with comprehensive metadata.

Timeline Milestones: Month 6 - Complete data acquisition and standardization; Month 12 - Complete initial comparative analyses for 30 species; Month 18 - Complete architectural protein phylogenetic analyses; Month 24 - Complete evolutionary constraint analyses; Month 30 - Complete Chromatin Architecture Atlas beta version; Month 36 - Final publications, tool releases, and training program completion. The project requires intensive computational resources including high-performance computing clusters for Hi-C analysis and phylogenetic computations, substantial data storage (>100TB), and collaborative infrastructure for team coordination.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes that fundamentally advance molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for evolutionary and comparative genomics. The comprehensive integration of chromatin architecture data across eukaryotic diversity will yield both immediate scientific discoveries and lasting resources for the research community.

Primary Scientific Outcomes: The project will produce the first comprehensive evolutionary framework for understanding chromatin organization across eukaryotes. We will definitively establish which organizational features represent ancestral characteristics present in early eukaryotes versus lineage-specific innovations, resolving long-standing questions about the evolutionary origins of TADs, compartments, and loop structures. By identifying universal principles that govern genome organization across all eukaryotes, we will distinguish fundamental biophysical constraints from organism-specific regulatory strategies. The systematic analysis of architectural protein evolution will reveal how molecular mechanisms underlying genome organization have diversified, identifying functional analogs and convergent solutions to organizational challenges. Quantitative relationships between genomic properties, life history traits, and chromatin architecture will illuminate evolutionary forces shaping genome organization and predict organizational features in unstudied species. Case studies of lineage-specific innovations will demonstrate how chromatin evolution enables regulatory capabilities underlying major evolutionary transitions including multicellularity, complex development, and environmental adaptation.

Community Resources and Tools: We will deliver a comprehensive Chromatin Architecture Atlas—a publicly accessible database integrating standardized chromatin data from 50+ species with interactive visualization tools, downloadable datasets, and extensive metadata. This atlas will serve as the definitive reference for comparative chromatin biology, analogous to how phylogenetic databases transformed evolutionary biology. We will develop and release open-source computational tools specifically designed for cross-species chromatin comparison, including methods for synteny-aware feature alignment, phylogenetically-informed statistical testing, and organizational metric quantification. These tools will be packaged as user-friendly R/Python libraries with comprehensive documentation, enabling researchers without specialized computational expertise to perform comparative analyses. Curated datasets of orthologous regulatory elements and architectural protein binding sites across species will facilitate functional studies and provide training data for machine learning approaches. All analysis workflows will be documented as reproducible pipelines using workflow management systems (Snakemake, Nextflow) and containerized for portability.

Broader Scientific Impact: This work will impact multiple research communities beyond chromatin biology. Evolutionary biologists will gain insights into genome evolution and the molecular basis of evolutionary innovations. Developmental biologists will understand how chromatin organization enables complex developmental programs and how these mechanisms evolved. Medical researchers will gain evolutionary context for interpreting human chromatin biology and disease mechanisms—understanding which features are deeply conserved versus recently derived informs therapeutic target selection and interpretation of genetic variation. Researchers working with emerging model organisms will access chromatin architecture data and analytical frameworks applicable to their systems. The comparative frameworks developed here will serve as templates for evolutionary analyses of other molecular and cellular features including transcriptional networks, signaling pathways, and cellular structures.

Training and Workforce Development: The project includes comprehensive training programs to develop the next generation of data-savvy researchers capable of integrating diverse datasets and applying computational approaches to biological questions. We will train 6-8 graduate students and postdocs directly through working group participation, providing hands-on experience with large-scale data integration, comparative genomics, and collaborative science. Annual workshops will train 30-40 additional trainees in comparative chromatin analysis methods, with materials made freely available online. We will develop online tutorials and courses covering data acquisition, quality control, comparative analysis, and phylogenetic methods, reaching hundreds of researchers globally. Trainees will gain expertise spanning chromatin biology, evolutionary genomics, and computational biology—interdisciplinary skills increasingly essential for modern biological research. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and diverse institutional settings.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: Findings will be disseminated through multiple high-impact publications including: a flagship paper presenting the Chromatin Architecture Atlas and major evolutionary findings; focused papers on architectural protein evolution, evolutionary constraints, and lineage-specific innovations; methods papers describing computational tools and comparative frameworks; and perspective pieces synthesizing implications for chromatin biology, evolution, and human disease. We will target journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Nature Genetics, Genome Research, and Molecular Biology and Evolution to reach diverse audiences. Preprints will be posted immediately upon completion to ensure rapid dissemination. We will present findings at major conferences including ASHG, SMBE, Genome Informatics, and Chromatin and Epigenetics meetings. The Chromatin Architecture Atlas will be promoted through webinars, social media, and direct outreach to relevant research communities.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes infrastructure and frameworks that will continue generating value long after the initial funding period. The Chromatin Architecture Atlas will be maintained and expanded as new datasets become available, with mechanisms for community contributions. Computational tools will be maintained as open-source projects with active developer communities. The comparative frameworks established here will enable future studies addressing additional questions about chromatin evolution and function. We will pursue additional funding to expand taxonomic sampling, integrate emerging data types (single-cell Hi-C, multi-way chromatin contacts), and extend analyses to additional cellular and molecular features. Collaborations established through this project will continue generating insights and training opportunities. Ultimately, this work will establish comparative and evolutionary approaches as standard practice in chromatin biology, ensuring that discoveries are interpreted within proper evolutionary context and that the full diversity of eukaryotic solutions to organizational challenges informs our understanding of genome function.

This synthesis project will integrate time-series transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and single-cell data from circadian, cell cycle, and metabolic studies to construct a unified framework of cellular timekeeping. By bringing together chronobiologists, cell cycle biologists, systems biologists, and applied mathematicians, we will analyze oscillatory patterns across molecular layers to identify coupling mechanisms, hierarchical relationships, and emergent temporal organization. The project will synthesize data from CircaDB, Cyclebase, time-resolved omics studies, and single-cell temporal datasets to address how cells integrate multiple timing cues and maintain temporal coordination. We will develop mathematical models of coupled oscillators, apply signal processing techniques to identify phase relationships, and determine how perturbations propagate through temporal networks. This addresses fundamental questions about cellular time perception and coordination of complex processes. The synthesis requires integration of multi-omics time-series data, sophisticated mathematical modeling, and expertise spanning multiple biological timing systems—capabilities exceeding individual laboratories. Outputs will include a temporal coordination atlas, tools for analyzing coupled oscillators in biological data, standardized workflows for time-series integration, and training programs in quantitative temporal biology. This resource will transform understanding of how cells orchestrate time-dependent processes and reveal new therapeutic targets for circadian and cell cycle disorders.",,"Background And Significance

Temporal organization is fundamental to cellular function, yet our understanding of how cells coordinate multiple timing systems remains fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. Cells operate numerous molecular oscillators simultaneously: circadian clocks that align physiology with day-night cycles, cell cycle machinery that ensures proper division timing, metabolic rhythms that optimize energy utilization, and developmental timers that control differentiation. Each system has been extensively studied in isolation, generating vast repositories of time-series data across transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic platforms. However, the critical question of how these oscillatory networks interact, influence each other, and maintain coherent temporal organization across biological scales remains one of the most significant unsolved puzzles in molecular and cellular biology.

Circadian biology has revealed that approximately 40-50% of mammalian transcripts exhibit daily oscillations, controlled by core clock genes including CLOCK, BMAL1, PER, and CRY families. These transcriptional-translational feedback loops generate ~24-hour rhythms that regulate diverse cellular processes. Simultaneously, cell cycle research has identified oscillatory expression of cyclins, CDKs, and checkpoint regulators that drive progression through G1, S, G2, and M phases. Metabolic studies have uncovered rhythms in NAD+/NADH ratios, ATP levels, and metabolite concentrations that oscillate with feeding-fasting cycles. Recent single-cell studies have revealed substantial heterogeneity in oscillatory dynamics, with individual cells showing variable periods, phases, and amplitudes even within synchronized populations.

Despite these advances, fundamental gaps persist. First, we lack comprehensive understanding of coupling mechanisms between different oscillatory systems. Evidence suggests bidirectional interactions—circadian clocks gate cell cycle progression, metabolic state affects clock function, and cell cycle phase influences circadian amplitude—but the molecular mechanisms mediating these interactions remain unclear. Second, the hierarchical organization of cellular timekeeping is poorly defined. Do certain oscillators serve as master pacemakers, or does temporal coordination emerge from distributed interactions? Third, we do not understand how cells maintain temporal coherence across molecular layers (transcription, translation, metabolism) or how perturbations propagate through coupled oscillator networks.

These knowledge gaps have significant implications. Disrupted circadian rhythms are associated with cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. Cell cycle dysregulation drives oncogenesis. Understanding temporal coordination could reveal why shift work increases cancer risk, how chronotherapy can optimize drug timing, and why certain tissues are more vulnerable to circadian disruption. Moreover, synthetic biology efforts to engineer cellular timers require understanding natural temporal coordination principles.

The time is uniquely opportune for this synthesis project. First, unprecedented volumes of time-series omics data now exist in public repositories including CircaDB (circadian transcriptomics across tissues and conditions), Cyclebase (cell cycle expression data), MetabolomicsWorkbench (temporal metabolomics), and GEO/ArrayExpress (thousands of time-series experiments). Second, single-cell technologies have generated temporal datasets revealing cell-to-cell variability in oscillatory dynamics. Third, mathematical frameworks for analyzing coupled oscillators have matured, including phase response curve analysis, Kuramoto models, and information-theoretic approaches. Fourth, computational power and machine learning methods now enable integration of heterogeneous datasets at unprecedented scale.

Critically, addressing these questions requires capabilities beyond any single laboratory. It demands integration of datasets generated using different technologies (microarrays, RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics), across different model systems (mammals, flies, fungi, cyanobacteria), and spanning different biological contexts (tissues, cell lines, developmental stages). It requires expertise in circadian biology, cell cycle regulation, metabolism, systems biology, applied mathematics, and bioinformatics—perspectives rarely combined in individual research groups. The synthesis approach is essential because temporal coordination is an emergent property that cannot be understood by studying individual oscillators in isolation. This project will catalyze a transdisciplinary community to tackle this fundamental question, generating resources and frameworks that will transform our understanding of cellular timekeeping and enable new therapeutic approaches for temporal disorders.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to construct a unified framework of cellular timekeeping:

Research Question 1: What are the molecular mechanisms coupling different oscillatory systems (circadian, cell cycle, metabolic) within cells? We hypothesize that coupling occurs through three primary mechanisms: (1) shared regulatory molecules that participate in multiple oscillatory networks (e.g., NAD+ affecting both circadian SIRT1 activity and metabolic state), (2) transcriptional regulation where one oscillator controls expression of components in another system (e.g., circadian regulation of cell cycle genes), and (3) post-translational modifications that transmit timing information between systems (e.g., metabolic state affecting protein stability). We predict that integrating time-series transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data will reveal molecules exhibiting multiple periodicities, indicating participation in multiple oscillatory networks. We will test this by identifying genes/proteins/metabolites with significant oscillatory components at circadian (~24h), cell cycle (variable), and ultradian (<24h) periods, then mapping their regulatory interactions. We expect to find hub molecules that serve as temporal coordinators, and predict these will be enriched for post-translational modifiers, metabolic enzymes, and signaling molecules.

Research Question 2: What is the hierarchical organization of cellular oscillatory networks, and do master pacemakers exist? We hypothesize that cellular timekeeping exhibits a hierarchical structure where circadian clocks serve as dominant pacemakers that entrain other oscillators, but that this hierarchy is context-dependent and can be overridden by strong metabolic or proliferative signals. We predict that phase relationships between oscillators will show consistent patterns across cell types and conditions, with circadian rhythms showing greatest phase stability and metabolic rhythms showing greatest phase plasticity. To test this, we will apply Granger causality analysis and transfer entropy methods to time-series data to infer directional influences between oscillatory systems. We will analyze how phase relationships change under perturbations (clock gene knockouts, metabolic stress, cell cycle arrest) to determine which oscillators are most resistant to disruption. We expect to find that hierarchy is tissue-specific, with circadian dominance in liver and SCN, but cell cycle dominance in rapidly proliferating tissues.

Research Question 3: How do cells maintain temporal coherence across molecular layers (transcription, translation, post-translation, metabolism), and what mechanisms buffer against desynchronization? We hypothesize that temporal coherence is maintained through feedforward and feedback loops that align different molecular layers, and that specific buffering mechanisms (e.g., protein stability control, metabolite buffering) prevent phase drift. We predict that phase relationships between transcript and protein oscillations will be non-uniform, with some genes showing tight coupling (short protein half-lives) and others showing phase delays (long half-lives, regulated translation). We will test this by integrating matched transcriptomic and proteomic time-series datasets to calculate phase differences and identify post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We expect to find that core clock components show tight transcript-protein coupling, while output genes show more variable relationships. We predict that metabolic oscillations will show phase advances relative to transcriptional rhythms, reflecting their role as both inputs and outputs of cellular clocks.

Research Question 4: How do perturbations propagate through coupled oscillator networks, and what network properties confer resilience or vulnerability? We hypothesize that oscillator networks exhibit small-world properties where perturbations to hub nodes propagate broadly while perturbations to peripheral nodes remain localized. We predict that genetic perturbations (knockouts) will show different propagation patterns than environmental perturbations (temperature, nutrients), with genetic perturbations causing sustained phase shifts and environmental perturbations causing transient amplitude changes. To test this, we will analyze time-series datasets from perturbation experiments (clock gene knockouts, cell cycle inhibitors, metabolic stress) and compare oscillatory dynamics to control conditions. We will construct network models and simulate perturbations to predict vulnerable nodes. We expect to find that metabolic oscillators are most sensitive to environmental perturbations while circadian oscillators are most sensitive to genetic perturbations.

Expected Outcomes: Testing these hypotheses will yield: (1) a catalog of coupling molecules and mechanisms linking different oscillatory systems, (2) hierarchical network models defining temporal organization in different cell types and conditions, (3) quantitative phase relationships between molecular layers revealing coordination mechanisms, (4) perturbation response maps identifying vulnerable and resilient network components, and (5) predictive models enabling simulation of temporal dynamics under novel conditions. These outcomes will be validated through comparison with held-out datasets and through consistency across independent studies and model systems. Success will be measured by our ability to predict oscillatory behavior in new contexts and to identify previously unknown coupling mechanisms that can be experimentally validated by the broader community.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates four complementary methodological strategies: comprehensive data aggregation and harmonization, multi-scale oscillatory analysis, network inference and modeling, and perturbation analysis. This 36-month project is organized into five phases with specific milestones.

Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Data Identification, Acquisition, and Harmonization. We will systematically identify and acquire time-series datasets from multiple public repositories. Primary sources include: (1) CircaDB (>100 circadian transcriptomic datasets across tissues and organisms), (2) Cyclebase (cell cycle expression data from yeast, human, and other organisms), (3) Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress (time-series RNA-seq and microarray data), (4) PRIDE and ProteomeXchange (temporal proteomics), (5) MetabolomicsWorkbench (metabolite time-series), (6) Single-cell databases including CellxGene and SCPortalen (temporal single-cell RNA-seq). We will focus on datasets with: ≥12 time points per cycle, ≥2 complete cycles, biological replicates, and available metadata. Initial focus will be on mammalian systems (mouse, human) with expansion to Drosophila, yeast, and cyanobacteria for comparative analysis. Data harmonization will address technical heterogeneity through: batch effect correction using ComBat-seq and Harmony, normalization using TMM or DESeq2 for RNA-seq, and standardization of time representations (Zeitgeber time, circadian time, cell cycle phase). We will construct a unified data warehouse with standardized metadata following MINSEQE and MIAME standards. Milestone: Harmonized database containing ≥200 time-series datasets spanning transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

Phase 2 (Months 7-15): Oscillatory Pattern Detection and Characterization. We will apply multiple complementary algorithms to detect and characterize oscillations: (1) JTK_CYCLE and RAIN for circadian rhythm detection, (2) ARSER for identifying multiple periodicities, (3) Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data, (4) empirical mode decomposition for non-stationary oscillations, (5) wavelet analysis for time-frequency characterization, and (6) Bayesian methods (CYCLOPS) for single-cell oscillation detection. For each oscillatory component, we will extract: period, phase, amplitude, waveform shape, and statistical significance. We will develop a consensus approach requiring detection by ≥2 methods to minimize false positives. Single-cell analysis will characterize cell-to-cell variability in oscillatory parameters using circular statistics and phase coherence metrics. We will classify oscillatory patterns into categories: circadian (~24h), ultradian (<20h), infradian (>28h), and cell cycle-associated. Cross-platform integration will identify molecules oscillating at multiple levels (transcript, protein, metabolite). Milestone: Comprehensive oscillatory atlas cataloging >20,000 oscillating genes/proteins/metabolites with characterized temporal parameters.

Phase 3 (Months 10-24): Coupling Mechanism Identification and Network Inference. We will identify coupling between oscillatory systems through multiple approaches: (1) Phase relationship analysis using circular correlation to identify consistent phase differences between oscillators, (2) Granger causality testing to infer directional influences, (3) Transfer entropy to quantify information flow between oscillatory systems, (4) Dynamic time warping to align and compare oscillatory patterns, (5) Partial correlation networks controlling for indirect effects. We will construct multi-layer temporal networks where nodes represent oscillating molecules and edges represent temporal relationships (correlation, causality, regulatory interactions). Network layers will represent different molecular types (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) and different oscillatory systems (circadian, cell cycle, metabolic). We will integrate known regulatory interactions from databases (STRING, KEGG, Reactome) to distinguish direct from indirect relationships. Hub analysis will identify molecules participating in multiple oscillatory networks. Community detection algorithms (Louvain, Infomap) will identify temporal modules. We will develop coupled oscillator models using: (1) Kuramoto models for phase synchronization, (2) delay differential equations for transcriptional feedback loops, (3) stochastic models for single-cell variability, and (4) machine learning approaches (recurrent neural networks, reservoir computing) for complex dynamics. Model parameters will be fit to empirical data using Bayesian inference and validated through cross-validation. Milestone: Multi-layer temporal network models for ≥5 cell types with validated predictive accuracy.

Phase 4 (Months 16-30): Perturbation Analysis and Resilience Assessment. We will analyze time-series datasets from perturbation experiments including: genetic perturbations (clock gene knockouts, cell cycle mutants), pharmacological perturbations (period-altering compounds, cell cycle inhibitors), and environmental perturbations (temperature shifts, nutrient changes, light schedules). For each perturbation, we will quantify: changes in period, phase, and amplitude for each oscillator; propagation of effects through the network; recovery dynamics; and compensatory responses. We will apply dynamical systems analysis to characterize: bifurcations (qualitative changes in dynamics), basin of attraction (resilience to perturbations), and critical transitions. Network controllability analysis will identify driver nodes whose perturbation has maximal impact. We will simulate perturbations in our mathematical models and compare predictions to empirical observations, iteratively refining models. Milestone: Perturbation response atlas and validated predictive models of network resilience.

Phase 5 (Months 24-36): Tool Development, Integration, and Dissemination. We will develop open-source computational tools including: (1) TemporalIntegrator: R/Python package for multi-omics time-series integration, (2) OscillatorNet: network inference and visualization platform, (3) CoupledClockSim: simulation environment for coupled oscillator models, (4) PhaseAnalyzer: tools for phase relationship analysis. All tools will include comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and example datasets. We will create standardized workflows using Snakemake/Nextflow for reproducibility. The Temporal Coordination Atlas will be released as an interactive web resource with visualization tools and downloadable data. We will organize two virtual workshops (months 18 and 30) and one in-person synthesis meeting (month 24) to engage the broader community. Training materials including video tutorials, Jupyter notebooks, and case studies will be developed. Milestone: Published tools, atlas, and training resources with community adoption metrics.

Timeline Summary: Months 1-6: Data aggregation; Months 7-15: Oscillatory analysis; Months 10-24: Network inference and modeling; Months 16-30: Perturbation analysis; Months 24-36: Tool development and dissemination. Overlapping phases enable iterative refinement and integration.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes across multiple dimensions, fundamentally advancing molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for temporal systems analysis.

Scientific Outcomes: The primary deliverable is a Temporal Coordination Atlas—a comprehensive, publicly accessible resource cataloging oscillatory dynamics across molecular layers, cell types, and organisms. This atlas will include: (1) quantitative parameters (period, phase, amplitude, waveform) for >20,000 oscillating genes, proteins, and metabolites; (2) multi-layer temporal networks mapping coupling relationships between circadian, cell cycle, and metabolic oscillators; (3) hierarchical organization maps defining temporal control architecture in different cellular contexts; (4) phase relationship databases quantifying coordination between molecular layers; and (5) perturbation response profiles characterizing network resilience and vulnerability. This resource will enable researchers to query temporal dynamics of any gene/protein of interest, identify potential coupling mechanisms, and predict effects of perturbations—capabilities currently unavailable in any existing database.

The project will resolve long-standing questions about cellular timekeeping. We will definitively characterize coupling mechanisms between major oscillatory systems, revealing whether coordination occurs primarily through transcriptional regulation, shared metabolites, or post-translational modifications. We will establish whether cellular timekeeping follows a hierarchical master-slave organization or emerges from distributed interactions. We will quantify how temporal information flows between molecular layers and identify buffering mechanisms that maintain coherence. These insights will transform understanding of how cells orchestrate complex time-dependent processes from cell division to metabolism to stress responses.

Methodological Innovations: We will develop and validate novel analytical approaches for temporal systems biology. Our coupled oscillator modeling framework will provide generalizable methods for analyzing interacting rhythmic processes in any biological context. Signal processing techniques adapted from engineering will enable robust detection of multiple periodicities in noisy biological data. Network inference methods will distinguish direct coupling from indirect correlations in temporal data. These methodological advances will be packaged as open-source software tools with comprehensive documentation, enabling widespread adoption. The standardized workflows for multi-omics time-series integration will establish best practices for the field, addressing current lack of consensus on analytical approaches.

Broader Impacts: Understanding temporal coordination has profound implications for human health. Disrupted circadian rhythms are implicated in cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. Our identification of coupling mechanisms and vulnerable network nodes will reveal new therapeutic targets. The atlas will enable chronotherapy optimization—timing drug administration to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity based on temporal coordination principles. For cancer, understanding circadian-cell cycle coupling will explain why circadian disruption increases cancer risk and identify strategies to exploit temporal vulnerabilities in tumor cells. For metabolic disorders, characterizing circadian-metabolic coupling will inform timing of meals and medications. The perturbation response maps will predict individual variability in circadian disruption susceptibility, enabling personalized interventions.

The project will catalyze new interdisciplinary collaborations. By bringing together chronobiologists, cell cycle biologists, metabolic researchers, systems biologists, and mathematicians, we will break down traditional disciplinary silos. The working group will establish a sustained community of practice that continues beyond the funding period. We anticipate the synthesis will identify unexpected connections that spawn new experimental research programs. The models and predictions will generate testable hypotheses for experimental validation, creating a virtuous cycle between synthesis and experimentation.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train the next generation of data-savvy biologists through multiple mechanisms. Graduate students and postdocs will be embedded in the working group, gaining hands-on experience with data integration, computational modeling, and collaborative science. We will develop comprehensive training modules covering: time-series analysis methods, oscillator theory, network inference, and reproducible computational workflows. These materials will be disseminated through workshops, online tutorials, and a dedicated training portal. We will mentor early-career researchers in open science practices, collaborative research, and interdisciplinary communication. The project will particularly recruit trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with minority-serving institutions.

Dissemination and Sustainability: Results will be disseminated through multiple channels. We will publish high-impact papers in journals spanning chronobiology (e.g., Cell Metabolism), cell biology (e.g., Molecular Cell), and systems biology (e.g., Cell Systems). All publications will be open access. The Temporal Coordination Atlas will be hosted on a dedicated web portal with interactive visualization tools, maintained through institutional support beyond the project period. All data, code, and workflows will be deposited in appropriate repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, Dryad) with DOIs for citability. We will present findings at major conferences (Society for Research on Biological Rhythms, American Society for Cell Biology, ISMB) and organize symposia to engage the community. Social media and press releases will communicate findings to broader audiences.

Long-term Vision: This project establishes temporal coordination as a central organizing principle in cell biology, comparable to how network biology transformed understanding of cellular regulation. The resources and frameworks developed will enable systems-level understanding of cellular timekeeping for decades to come. We envision the atlas becoming a standard reference resource, analogous to how gene expression atlases transformed developmental biology. The synthesis approach will serve as a model for addressing other emergent phenomena in molecular and cellular biology, demonstrating the power of integrating diverse datasets to answer fundamental questions beyond the reach of individual laboratories.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_claude_10,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,claude-sonnet-4-5,The Protein Folding Landscape in Cellular Context: Integrating Proteostasis Networks Across Conditions and Organisms,"Protein folding in cells differs dramatically from in vitro conditions due to molecular crowding, chaperone networks, and quality control systems, yet comprehensive understanding of cellular proteostasis remains fragmented. This synthesis project will integrate proteomics data on protein abundance and turnover, structural databases, chaperone interaction networks, aggregation propensity predictions, and stress response datasets to map the cellular protein folding landscape. By assembling protein biochemists, cell biologists, biophysicists, and computational biologists, we will analyze how cells maintain proteome integrity across conditions, organisms, and evolutionary time. The project will synthesize data from ProteomeXchange, aggregation databases, chaperone interaction studies, and thermal proteome profiling to address fundamental questions: What determines which proteins require chaperones? How do proteostasis networks evolve? Why do certain proteins aggregate in disease? We will develop predictive models for protein folding outcomes in cellular environments, identify vulnerable proteins prone to misfolding, and map how proteostasis capacity varies across cell types and conditions. This requires integration of structural predictions, interaction networks, abundance measurements, and functional data at proteome scale—beyond single-lab capabilities. Deliverables include a cellular proteostasis atlas, tools for predicting folding outcomes and aggregation risk in cellular context, standardized analysis pipelines, and interdisciplinary training programs bridging biochemistry and cell biology. This resource will provide new insights into protein homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases while training researchers in integrative proteomics approaches.",,"Background And Significance

Protein folding is fundamental to cellular function, yet our understanding of how proteins achieve their native conformations within the complex cellular environment remains incomplete. While decades of in vitro biochemistry have elucidated basic folding principles, the cellular context introduces layers of complexity that dramatically alter folding outcomes. Molecular crowding, with macromolecule concentrations reaching 300-400 g/L in cells, fundamentally changes protein stability and aggregation propensities. The cellular proteostasis network—comprising molecular chaperones, folding catalysts, and quality control machinery—actively manages the folding landscape for thousands of proteins simultaneously. Understanding this system is critical for addressing protein misfolding diseases, optimizing biotechnology applications, and comprehending cellular stress responses.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented datasets relevant to cellular proteostasis. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics now routinely quantifies protein abundance, turnover rates, and post-translational modifications across thousands of proteins. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) provide proteome-wide measurements of protein stability and conformational states in living cells. Chaperone interaction networks have been mapped through affinity purification and proximity labeling approaches. AlphaFold2 and related tools now provide structural predictions for entire proteomes. Aggregation-prone regions have been catalogued through experimental screens and computational predictions. Stress response datasets document proteome remodeling under heat shock, oxidative stress, and disease conditions. Despite this wealth of data, these resources remain siloed in separate repositories, analyzed by distinct research communities, and interpreted through discipline-specific frameworks.

Current understanding of cellular proteostasis suffers from critical gaps. First, we lack comprehensive knowledge of which proteins require chaperone assistance for folding versus those that fold spontaneously in cells. While estimates suggest 10-30% of proteins interact with major chaperones, the determinants of chaperone dependence remain poorly defined. Second, the evolutionary principles governing proteostasis network architecture across organisms are unclear. Why do some organisms invest heavily in specific chaperone families while others rely on alternative strategies? Third, the mechanisms determining why specific proteins aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS remain incompletely understood, despite knowing disease-associated proteins. Fourth, we cannot reliably predict which proteins will misfold under specific stress conditions or in different cell types, limiting our ability to anticipate proteostasis collapse.

Several landmark studies have highlighted the importance of integrative approaches. Hartl and colleagues demonstrated that chaperone networks function as interconnected systems rather than independent pathways. Balch's proteostasis framework emphasized that folding outcomes depend on the balance between protein folding load and cellular capacity. Recent work by Hipp et al. showed that metastable proteins—those near the threshold of aggregation—are particularly vulnerable to stress and aging. Thermal proteome profiling studies by Savitski and colleagues revealed that protein stability varies dramatically across cell types and conditions. However, these insights have not been systematically integrated across the full proteome and multiple organisms.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exists in public repositories but requires expert integration. ProteomeXchange contains over 20,000 datasets spanning diverse organisms and conditions. Aggregation databases like AmyPro and WALTZ catalogue experimentally validated aggregation-prone sequences. Chaperone interaction data from BioGRID and IntAct provide network context. AlphaFold structures cover model organism proteomes. Second, computational infrastructure and machine learning approaches have matured sufficiently to handle proteome-scale integration. Third, the urgency of understanding protein misfolding diseases has intensified with aging populations and limited therapeutic options. Fourth, training the next generation of researchers in integrative, data-driven approaches is essential as biology becomes increasingly computational.

The proposed synthesis addresses fundamental questions that cannot be answered by individual labs working with single datasets or model systems. It requires expertise spanning protein biochemistry, structural biology, cell biology, biophysics, computational biology, and evolutionary biology. The scale of data integration—spanning millions of measurements across thousands of proteins and multiple organisms—necessitates collaborative infrastructure and standardized analytical frameworks. By bringing together diverse expertise and synthesizing fragmented knowledge, this project will transform our understanding of how cells maintain proteome integrity and provide actionable insights for addressing protein misfolding diseases.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that require integration of diverse datasets and multidisciplinary expertise:

Research Question 1: What molecular features determine chaperone dependence for protein folding in cellular environments? We hypothesize that chaperone dependence is determined by a combination of intrinsic protein properties (structural complexity, hydrophobic exposure, domain architecture) and cellular context (expression level, synthesis rate, localization). Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) proteins with high contact order, multiple domains, and extensive buried hydrophobic surface area will show greater chaperone dependence; (H1b) highly abundant proteins will have evolved reduced chaperone dependence to minimize cellular burden; (H1c) rapidly synthesized proteins will require more chaperone assistance due to co-translational folding challenges. We will test these hypotheses by integrating chaperone interaction data from affinity purification-mass spectrometry studies with AlphaFold structural predictions, ribosome profiling data on synthesis rates, and proteomics measurements of abundance. Machine learning models will identify features predictive of chaperone dependence, validated against independent experimental datasets. Expected outcomes include a quantitative framework for predicting chaperone requirements and identification of protein classes most vulnerable to chaperone network perturbations.

Research Question 2: How do proteostasis network architectures evolve across organisms, and what principles govern their optimization? We hypothesize that proteostasis networks co-evolve with proteome composition, environmental challenges, and life history strategies. Specifically: (H2a) organisms with larger proteomes and greater protein complexity will invest more heavily in chaperone networks; (H2b) thermophilic organisms will show enhanced investment in disaggregases and holdase chaperones; (H2c) long-lived organisms will have more robust quality control systems to maintain proteome integrity over extended lifespans. We will test these hypotheses through comparative analysis of chaperone gene families, expression levels, and interaction networks across bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals, integrated with proteome complexity metrics, environmental data, and longevity measurements. Phylogenetic comparative methods will identify evolutionary correlations while controlling for phylogenetic relationships. Expected outcomes include evolutionary principles governing proteostasis network design and identification of lineage-specific innovations.

Research Question 3: Why do specific proteins aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases, and can we predict disease-vulnerable proteins? We hypothesize that disease-associated aggregation results from proteins operating near the threshold of cellular folding capacity, where modest perturbations tip the balance toward misfolding. Specifically: (H3a) disease-aggregating proteins will show marginal stability in thermal proteome profiling data; (H3b) these proteins will have high predicted aggregation propensity in specific regions but normally be protected by chaperones or cellular conditions; (H3c) disease-associated mutations will destabilize proteins beyond the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network. We will test these hypotheses by integrating disease mutation databases (ClinVar, OMIM), aggregation propensity predictions, thermal stability measurements, chaperone interaction data, and tissue-specific expression patterns. Comparative analysis of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's disease will identify common vulnerability signatures. Expected outcomes include predictive models for disease-associated aggregation and identification of previously unrecognized at-risk proteins.

Research Question 4: How does proteostasis capacity vary across cell types, developmental stages, and stress conditions, and what determines the threshold for proteostasis collapse? We hypothesize that proteostasis capacity is dynamically regulated and varies systematically with cellular state. Specifically: (H4a) post-mitotic cells (neurons, cardiomyocytes) will show reduced proteostasis capacity with age; (H4b) cells with high secretory burden will invest disproportionately in ER-localized chaperones; (H4c) proteostasis collapse occurs when the aggregate folding demand exceeds chaperone capacity by a threshold factor. We will test these hypotheses by integrating cell-type-specific proteomics data, developmental time-course datasets, stress response measurements, and aging studies across model organisms. Quantitative modeling will define proteostasis capacity as the ratio of chaperone availability to client protein folding demand. Expected outcomes include a cellular proteostasis atlas mapping capacity across cell types and conditions, and quantitative thresholds predicting collapse.

Cross-cutting validation approaches will ensure robustness. First, predictions will be validated against held-out experimental datasets not used in model training. Second, cross-organism validation will test whether principles identified in one species generalize to others. Third, we will identify discrepancies between predictions and observations as opportunities for biological discovery. Fourth, community feedback through workshops and preprint sharing will refine hypotheses iteratively.

Expected deliverables include: (1) quantitative models predicting chaperone dependence from sequence and structure; (2) evolutionary principles governing proteostasis network architecture; (3) disease-vulnerability scores for all human proteins; (4) cell-type and condition-specific proteostasis capacity maps; (5) standardized datasets integrating all analyzed data; (6) open-source software tools for proteostasis analysis; (7) training materials for interdisciplinary proteostasis research. These outcomes will transform understanding of cellular protein folding and provide actionable insights for disease intervention.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse public datasets through a phased analytical approach, leveraging complementary expertise from protein biochemistry, structural biology, cell biology, biophysics, computational biology, and evolutionary biology.

Data Sources and Assembly (Months 1-6): We will systematically compile datasets from multiple repositories. From ProteomeXchange (www.proteomexchange.org), we will extract: (1) protein abundance measurements across cell types, tissues, and organisms (>5,000 datasets); (2) protein turnover rates from pulse-chase and dynamic SILAC experiments; (3) thermal proteome profiling data measuring protein stability in cells; (4) limited proteolysis data reporting conformational states. From BioGRID, IntAct, and published studies, we will compile chaperone-client interaction networks for Hsp70, Hsp90, chaperonins, and small heat shock proteins across organisms. From PDB and AlphaFold Database, we will obtain structural information for all proteins in target organisms (E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, H. sapiens). From aggregation databases (AmyPro, WALTZ, Aggrescan), we will extract experimentally validated aggregation-prone regions. From ClinVar and OMIM, we will compile disease-associated mutations. From Gene Expression Omnibus, we will extract stress response transcriptomics and proteomics (heat shock, oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress). From ribosome profiling databases, we will obtain translation rates. A dedicated data management team will standardize identifiers, quality-filter datasets, and create a unified database with comprehensive metadata.

Analytical Pipeline Development (Months 4-12): We will develop standardized computational pipelines for data integration and analysis. Structural feature extraction will use AlphaFold predictions to calculate contact order, domain architecture, buried surface area, secondary structure content, and intrinsic disorder. Aggregation propensity will be computed using multiple algorithms (TANGO, Zyggregator, PASTA 2.0) and integrated through ensemble approaches. Chaperone dependence classification will employ machine learning (random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) trained on experimentally validated chaperone-client interactions, using structural features, abundance, synthesis rates, and localization as predictors. Cross-validation and independent test sets will assess model performance. Proteostasis capacity modeling will quantify the ratio of available chaperone binding sites to client protein folding demand, incorporating abundance, stoichiometry, and binding kinetics from literature. All pipelines will be implemented in Python and R, containerized with Docker, and version-controlled on GitHub.

Comparative Evolutionary Analysis (Months 6-18): We will analyze proteostasis network evolution across 100+ organisms spanning the tree of life. Chaperone gene families will be identified through orthology analysis (OrthoFinder) and quantified for gene number, expression level, and interaction network size. Proteome complexity metrics will include proteome size, average protein length, domain architecture complexity, and predicted aggregation propensity. Environmental data (optimal growth temperature, habitat) and life history traits (lifespan, reproductive strategy) will be compiled from databases and literature. Phylogenetic comparative methods (phylogenetic generalized least squares, phylogenetic independent contrasts) implemented in R packages (ape, phytools, caper) will test evolutionary correlations while controlling for shared ancestry. Ancestral state reconstruction will infer proteostasis network evolution along phylogenetic branches.

Disease Protein Analysis (Months 12-24): We will conduct comprehensive analysis of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Disease-associated proteins and mutations will be mapped onto structural models to assess stability effects using FoldX and Rosetta. Thermal stability data from cellular TPP experiments will be compared between disease and control conditions. Chaperone interaction networks will be analyzed for disease proteins to identify protective interactions. Aggregation propensity predictions will be computed for wild-type and mutant sequences. Tissue-specific expression patterns will be integrated to understand cell-type vulnerability. Machine learning classifiers will be trained to distinguish disease-aggregating proteins from non-aggregating proteins matched for abundance and expression pattern. Feature importance analysis will identify key vulnerability determinants. Predictions will be validated against proteins recently implicated in disease through genetic studies.

Cell-Type and Condition-Specific Analysis (Months 18-30): We will construct a cellular proteostasis atlas mapping capacity across biological contexts. Cell-type-specific proteomics data will be compiled for 50+ human cell types, 20+ mouse tissues, and developmental time courses in model organisms. For each context, we will quantify: (1) chaperone expression levels and stoichiometry; (2) client protein abundance and predicted folding demand; (3) proteostasis capacity scores; (4) stress response dynamics. Clustering analysis will identify cell types with similar proteostasis profiles. Developmental trajectories will reveal how proteostasis capacity changes during differentiation and aging. Stress response data will define thresholds for proteostasis collapse under heat shock, oxidative stress, and proteotoxic conditions. Interactive visualization tools will enable exploration of the atlas.

Integration and Validation (Months 24-36): Final integration will synthesize all analyses into unified models and resources. Cross-validation will test predictions against independent datasets. Discrepancy analysis will identify cases where predictions fail, highlighting areas for biological investigation. Sensitivity analysis will assess robustness to data quality and parameter choices. Community workshops (Months 12, 24, 36) will gather feedback and refine approaches. All data, code, and models will be deposited in public repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare) with comprehensive documentation.

Timeline Milestones: Month 6: Data assembly complete, initial pipelines operational; Month 12: Chaperone dependence models complete, first workshop; Month 18: Evolutionary analysis complete; Month 24: Disease protein analysis complete, second workshop; Month 30: Proteostasis atlas complete; Month 36: Final integration, publications, third workshop, training materials released.

Scientific Contributions: The primary deliverable is a comprehensive Cellular Proteostasis Atlas, an open-access resource integrating structural, abundance, stability, interaction, and functional data for proteomes across organisms and conditions. This atlas will provide unprecedented insights into how cells maintain protein homeostasis. Specifically, we will deliver: (1) Chaperone Dependence Database cataloguing predicted and experimentally validated chaperone requirements for >100,000 proteins across organisms, with confidence scores and supporting evidence; (2) Evolutionary Proteostasis Compendium documenting chaperone network architecture across 100+ species with quantitative metrics and phylogenetic analysis; (3) Disease Vulnerability Scores for all human proteins, ranking aggregation risk and identifying previously unrecognized disease candidates; (4) Cell-Type Proteostasis Maps quantifying folding capacity across 50+ human cell types and developmental stages; (5) Stress Response Models predicting proteostasis collapse thresholds under various perturbations.

Understanding chaperone dependence determinants will reveal design principles governing protein evolution and inform synthetic biology efforts to engineer proteins with desired folding properties. Evolutionary insights will illuminate how organisms adapt proteostasis networks to environmental challenges and life history strategies, with implications for understanding adaptation and speciation. Disease vulnerability predictions will prioritize proteins for therapeutic intervention and suggest biomarkers for early detection of proteostasis collapse. Cell-type-specific proteostasis maps will explain differential vulnerability to stress and aging, informing regenerative medicine and aging research.

Biotechnology applications will benefit from improved ability to engineer proteins that fold efficiently in production systems. Agricultural applications may emerge from understanding how plants maintain proteostasis under environmental stress.

The training program will prepare graduate students and postdocs for careers in data-intensive biology. Participants will gain expertise in proteomics, structural biology, computational analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration—skills increasingly essential as biology becomes more quantitative and integrative. We will particularly recruit trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with minority-serving institutions and professional societies. Training materials will be freely available, extending impact beyond direct participants.

Dissemination and Open Science: We are committed to open science principles throughout the project. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be publicly available in real-time through GitHub repositories and preprint servers.

Interactive web portals will enable community exploration of results without computational expertise. We will organize three community workshops to gather feedback, demonstrate tools, and train users. Annual progress reports will be posted publicly. We will engage with disease advocacy organizations to communicate findings to patient communities.

Publication Strategy: We anticipate 8-12 peer-reviewed publications spanning high-impact general journals (Nature, Science, Cell) for major integrative findings, specialized journals (Molecular Cell, Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Cell Reports) for focused analyses, and methods journals (Nature Methods, Bioinformatics) for computational tools. We will also publish data descriptor papers in Scientific Data to maximize dataset visibility and reuse.

Follow-up Research: This project will catalyze numerous follow-up investigations. Predictions of vulnerable proteins will motivate experimental validation studies. Evolutionary insights will inspire comparative studies in non-model organisms. Disease vulnerability scores will guide clinical genetic studies and therapeutic development. The atlas will serve as a reference for interpreting future proteomics experiments. We will actively seek partnerships with experimental labs to validate predictions and with pharmaceutical companies to translate findings.

Long-term Sustainability: Beyond the funding period, we will maintain the Cellular Proteostasis Atlas through integration with existing databases (UniProt, PDB, ProteomeXchange). We will seek additional funding for experimental validation and expansion to additional organisms and conditions. The trained cohort of researchers will form a community of practice continuing to advance integrative proteostasis research. By establishing standardized approaches and demonstrating the power of synthesis research, this project will inspire similar efforts addressing other fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biology.

The function of a protein is determined by its sequence and structure, which in turn dictate its role in various biological processes. Despite the exponential growth of protein sequence and structure data, the function of many proteins remains unknown or poorly understood. This knowledge gap significantly hampers our ability to understand cellular mechanisms, predict disease-causing mutations, and design novel therapeutics. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to predict protein function from sequence and structure data, offering a promising solution to this challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of machine learning models to predict protein function with high accuracy. However, these models are often limited by the quality and diversity of the training data, and the lack of comprehensive evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the interpretation of predicted protein functions remains a significant challenge, requiring the integration of additional data types and biological knowledge. This project aims to address these limitations by developing novel machine learning approaches that integrate multiple data types and leverage the strengths of different algorithms. Our approach will provide a comprehensive platform for protein function prediction, enabling researchers to identify potential functional motifs, predict protein function, and explore the relationships between sequence, structure, and function.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression and cellular processes, with their dysregulation implicated in various human diseases. Despite their importance, the functions of many ncRNAs remain unknown, and their role in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. The rapid growth of publicly available genomic and transcriptomic data provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate ncRNAs in human diseases. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these data necessitate a community-scale approach to integrate and analyze them effectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of ncRNA biology and their involvement in disease mechanisms is still lacking. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by leveraging publicly available data to identify novel ncRNAs associated with human diseases and elucidate their potential functional roles. The identification of disease-associated ncRNAs could lead to the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

By synthesizing molecular and cellular data from diverse sources, the research aims to uncover novel insights into how epigenetic changes control gene expression. The project will involve collaboration between epigeneticists, molecular biologists, and data scientists, and will provide training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.",,"Background And Significance

Epigenetic regulation is a complex and dynamic process that controls gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including development, aging, and memory formation, and is implicated in numerous diseases, such as cancer, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Despite significant advances in the field, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation remains incomplete. This research aims to fill this gap by leveraging existing data and cross-disciplinary collaboration. A detailed literature review reveals that while many studies have explored individual aspects of epigenetic regulation, few have integrated these findings to provide a comprehensive picture. This research is timely and important as it will not only advance our understanding of epigenetic regulation but also provide a model for cross-disciplinary collaboration and data synthesis in the molecular and cellular biosciences.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research will address the following questions: 1) How do different types of epigenetic modifications interact to regulate gene expression? 2) What are the key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these interactions? 3) How do these mechanisms vary across different cell types and developmental stages? Based on existing literature, we hypothesize that different types of epigenetic modifications interact in a complex and dynamic manner to regulate gene expression, and that these interactions are mediated by specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that vary across different cell types and developmental stages. We will test these hypotheses by synthesizing and analyzing existing data on epigenetic regulation. The expected outcomes include novel insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and a model for cross-disciplinary collaboration and data synthesis.

Methods And Approach

We will use existing publicly available data on epigenetic modifications, gene expression, and cellular processes from various sources, including the ENCODE project, the Roadmap Epigenomics project, and the Gene Expression Omnibus. We will integrate these datasets using advanced computational approaches, including machine learning and network analysis, to uncover patterns and relationships that are not apparent from individual datasets. We will validate our findings using statistical analysis and by comparing them with existing experimental results. The project will be carried out over three years, with specific milestones and deliverables for each year.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This research is expected to make significant contributions to the field of epigenetics by providing novel insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. It will also demonstrate the power of cross-disciplinary collaboration and data synthesis in advancing our understanding of complex biological processes. The findings could have broad applications in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and environmental science. The project will also provide training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs, thereby contributing to the development of a data-savvy workforce. We plan to disseminate our findings through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and open-access data and analysis workflows.

Budget And Resources

The budget for this project includes costs for data access and storage, computational resources, personnel (including salaries for researchers, graduate students, and postdocs), and travel for meetings and conferences. We estimate a total budget of $500,000 over three years. This includes $100,000 for data access and storage, $100,000 for computational resources, $200,000 for personnel, and $100,000 for travel. We will leverage existing resources at our institutions, including high-performance computing facilities and data storage infrastructure. We will also seek additional funding from other sources to supplement the budget.",,
ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_01,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,"The Emergent Phenotypes of Cellular Senescence: A Multi-Omic Synthesis of Stress, Context, and Fate","Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, is a fundamental biological process implicated in aging, cancer, and tissue repair. However, it is not a monolithic state; rather, it is a collection of heterogeneous phenotypes whose emergence is governed by a complex interplay between the initiating stressor, cell type, and tissue microenvironment. This working group will address a long-standing puzzle: what are the fundamental principles that determine the specific 'flavor' of senescence, particularly the composition of the pro-inflammatory Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)? We propose a community-scale synthesis project that integrates disparate, publicly available datasets to deconstruct the emergence of senescent heterogeneity. Our transdisciplinary team of cell biologists, bioinformaticians, systems biologists, and machine learning experts will collate and harmonize transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq), proteomic, and metabolomic data from hundreds of studies across diverse cell types, species, and senescence inducers (e.g., oncogenic, replicative, therapy-induced). By applying advanced network inference algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, we will build a multi-layered molecular atlas of senescence. This will allow us to move beyond cataloging differences to modeling how initial stress signals propagate through regulatory networks to establish stable, emergent senescent states. The project will develop a predictive model of SASP composition based on cellular context and stressor identity, identify core regulatory modules that act as master switches for different senescence programs, and create a publicly accessible, integrated data resource and analysis portal for the research community. This work will provide a systems-level understanding of a key biological process and has the potential to revolutionize the development of targeted senolytic therapies for a wide range of age-related diseases.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular senescence, first described as a limit to cellular proliferation in vitro, is now recognized as a fundamental biological process with profound, yet paradoxical, roles in vivo. This state of stable cell cycle arrest, governed primarily by the p53/p21 and p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathways, acts as a potent barrier to malignant transformation. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age is also a key driver of organismal aging and a contributor to a host of age-related pathologies, including cancer, fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. A central feature of most senescent cells is the acquisition of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a complex secretome comprising pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling proteases. The SASP is responsible for many of the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescence, mediating chronic inflammation, altering tissue structures, and influencing the behavior of neighboring cells. Yet, the SASP also has beneficial functions, such as signaling for immune-mediated clearance of senescent or pre-cancerous cells and promoting tissue repair.

A critical turning point in the field has been the growing appreciation that senescence is not a single, uniform state. Landmark studies have demonstrated that the specific composition of the SASP, and the senescent phenotype more broadly, is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent. The nature of the initiating stressor—be it telomere attrition (replicative senescence), oncogene activation (OIS), DNA damage, or metabolic dysfunction—profoundly shapes the resulting phenotype. For instance, the SASP induced by oncogenic RAS differs significantly from that induced by DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Furthermore, the cell type of origin and its surrounding microenvironment impose additional layers of regulation. A senescent fibroblast secretes a different cocktail of factors than a senescent epithelial cell, even when triggered by the same stimulus. This heterogeneity is the central puzzle in senescence biology today. While we have a growing 'parts list' of SASP components and upstream signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB, C/EBPβ, GATA4), we lack a systems-level, mechanistic understanding of how these diverse inputs are integrated to produce a specific, stable, and emergent phenotypic output.

This gap in our knowledge represents a major barrier to therapeutic progress. The development of senolytics—drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells—is one of the most exciting frontiers in geroscience, with several compounds in clinical trials. However, a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to eliminating senescent cells may be suboptimal or even detrimental, as it fails to distinguish between cells with beneficial versus pathological functions. A more sophisticated strategy would be to modulate the SASP, selectively inhibiting its harmful components while preserving its beneficial ones. This requires a predictive understanding of what controls the SASP's composition, which is currently impossible due to the siloed nature of existing research. Individual studies typically focus on one cell type and one stressor, generating valuable but narrow datasets. The explosion of publicly available multi-omic data (transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic) from hundreds of such studies presents an unprecedented opportunity. However, integrating these disparate datasets, which use different platforms and protocols, is a massive undertaking beyond the scope of any single research lab. This project is therefore both important and timely. By convening a multidisciplinary working group to perform a community-scale synthesis of this data, we can finally deconstruct the complex logic of senescence heterogeneity and build the predictive models necessary to guide the next generation of senotherapeutic strategies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group will address the fundamental question of how diverse senescent phenotypes emerge from the complex interplay of stress, cell type, and molecular context. We have formulated three specific, interrelated research questions, each with testable hypotheses, that will guide our data synthesis approach.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can we establish a comprehensive, multi-omic taxonomy of senescent states that moves beyond single-marker definitions to create a robust classification system based on integrated molecular signatures?**
Our central hypothesis is that senescent cells do not exist on a simple continuum but rather occupy distinct, stable states in a high-dimensional molecular space. We will test two specific sub-hypotheses:
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Senescent states cluster primarily by the cell's lineage of origin and secondarily by the class of inducing stressor. We predict that the baseline epigenetic and transcriptional state of a progenitor cell acts as a primary constraint, defining a limited repertoire of possible senescent phenotypes it can adopt. The specific stressor then selects for or fine-tunes a particular state within that repertoire.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** These distinct senescent clusters are defined by unique combinations of active gene regulatory networks, chromatin states, and metabolic programs, not just by the expression of a few canonical markers like p16 or SA-β-gal. We predict our integrated analysis will reveal novel, subtype-specific markers that are more reliable classifiers than existing ones.
*   **Testing and Deliverable:** We will test these hypotheses by applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to our integrated multi-omic dataset. The validity of the resulting clusters will be assessed by their stability across different algorithms and their association with metadata (cell type, stressor). The key deliverable will be a publicly accessible 'Senescence Atlas,' a foundational resource cataloging robustly defined senescent subtypes and their defining molecular features.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and master transcription factors (TFs) that orchestrate the establishment and maintenance of specific senescent phenotypes, particularly the diverse compositions of the SASP?**
We hypothesize that the vast heterogeneity of the SASP is controlled by a combinatorial logic involving a limited set of 'hub' TFs that integrate upstream signals and context-specific chromatin accessibility.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Beyond the well-established roles of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, we will identify context-specific master TFs that drive distinct modules of the SASP (e.g., a 'pro-fibrotic' module vs. an 'immune-chemoattractant' module). We predict that the identity of these TFs will be strongly dependent on cell lineage.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The epigenetic landscape (i.e., chromatin accessibility) acts as a critical 'gatekeeper' that determines the regulatory potential of these TFs. A TF may be highly expressed, but if its target gene promoters are inaccessible in a given cell type, it cannot execute its regulatory function. This TF-epigenome interplay is a key determinant of the final phenotype.
*   **Testing and Deliverable:** We will use advanced network inference algorithms to reconstruct GRNs for each major senescent subtype identified in RQ1. These networks will be constrained by integrated ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data to increase their biological accuracy. We will validate predicted hub TFs by assessing the correlation between their activity and the expression of their predicted target genes across hundreds of samples. The deliverable will be a set of validated, context-specific GRNs that provide mechanistic blueprints for different senescent fates.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can we develop a quantitative, predictive model that accurately forecasts the SASP composition based on the identity of the stressor and the multi-omic state of the pre-senescent cell?**
We hypothesize that the determinants of the SASP are sufficiently encoded in the initial cellular state and the nature of the stress, and that this complex relationship can be learned by advanced machine learning models.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** A machine learning model trained on our integrated atlas can predict the expression levels of key SASP factors with significantly higher accuracy than a simple linear model, indicating the presence of complex, non-linear interactions between determinants.
*   **Testing and Deliverable:** We will train and test various machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks) on a partitioned subset of our harmonized data. The model's inputs will be features representing cell type and stressor, and its outputs will be the expression levels of ~100 core SASP factors. Performance will be rigorously evaluated on a held-out test set. The final deliverable will be a validated, open-source computational tool that allows researchers to perform in silico experiments, predicting the SASP for novel combinations of cell types and stressors.

Methods And Approach

This project is designed as a multi-phase, collaborative effort that leverages the unique, transdisciplinary expertise of our working group. Our approach is grounded in open science principles, ensuring all methods, code, and data are transparent and reproducible.

**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** Our team comprises experts in senescence cell biology (PI 1), bioinformatics and data harmonization (PI 2), systems biology and network inference (PI 3), and machine learning (PI 4). This structure is essential, as the project requires deep domain knowledge to guide data curation, sophisticated computational skills for data processing and modeling, and biological intuition for interpreting the results. The project will be managed through a central GitHub repository for code and analysis pipelines, a shared cloud-based data storage platform, and bi-weekly virtual meetings. Two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students will form the core research team, receiving direct mentorship from all PIs, thereby fostering the next generation of data-savvy biologists as per the research call's mission.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Harmonization, and Integration (Months 1-12)**
This foundational phase focuses on creating the integrated dataset. 
*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic, exhaustive search of public repositories, including NCBI GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress, ProteomeXchange, and Metabolomics Workbench. Our search will use a comprehensive set of keywords (e.g., 'cellular senescence', 'SASP', 'oncogene-induced senescence') to identify all relevant publicly available transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq for key histone marks and TFs), proteomic, and metabolomic datasets from human and mouse models. We anticipate identifying and curating over 500 distinct experimental series.
*   **Metadata Standardization:** A rigorous curation process will capture essential metadata for each sample in a standardized format, including species, cell/tissue type, senescence inducer, time post-induction, and experimental protocol. This structured metadata is critical for all downstream analyses.
*   **Unified Processing Pipelines:** To ensure comparability, all raw data will be reprocessed from scratch using a single set of best-practice pipelines. These pipelines will be containerized using Docker and managed with a workflow manager like Nextflow. For example, all RNA-seq data will be aligned to the same reference genome build (GRCh38/mm10) and quantified using Salmon. ATAC-seq data will be processed through a uniform pipeline for alignment, peak calling (MACS2), and signal normalization. This step is crucial for removing technical artifacts stemming from different processing methods in the original publications.
*   **Batch Effect Correction and Integration:** The harmonized, gene-level count matrices and genomic signal tracks will be integrated. We will employ advanced batch correction algorithms, such as Harmony or ComBat-seq, which are designed to remove technical variability between studies while preserving the underlying biological heterogeneity, a key requirement for our study.

**Phase 2: Constructing the Multi-Omic Senescence Atlas (RQ1) (Months 10-20)**
*   **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:** Using the integrated transcriptomic data as a scaffold, we will apply non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (UMAP, t-SNE) to visualize the global structure of senescent states. We will then use graph-based clustering algorithms (e.g., Leiden) to partition the cells into distinct clusters, or 'subtypes'. The robustness of these clusters will be tested by consensus clustering and silhouette scoring.
*   **Multi-Omic Characterization:** We will use tools like MOFA+ to integrate data layers, identifying latent factors that capture variability across transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and proteomics. Each subtype will be deeply characterized by identifying differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways (GSEA), active TF motifs (using the underlying ATAC-seq data), and distinct proteomic signatures.

**Phase 3: Gene Regulatory Network Inference (RQ2) (Months 18-28)**
*   **Network Reconstruction:** For each major subtype defined in Phase 2, we will reconstruct a context-specific GRN. We will use information-theoretic algorithms like ARACNE or regression-based methods like GENIE3, which infer TF-target relationships from expression data. 
*   **Network Refinement:** To improve accuracy, these inferred networks will be pruned and refined using prior biological knowledge. Specifically, we will retain only those regulatory edges where (a) the target gene's promoter is accessible in the corresponding ATAC-seq data and (b) the TF's binding motif is present. Where available, ChIP-seq data will be used for further validation. Network centrality analyses will then be used to identify the 'hub' TFs that are predicted to be the master regulators of each state.

**Phase 4: Predictive Modeling of the SASP (RQ3) (Months 24-33)**
*   **Model Building:** We will formulate the prediction of the SASP as a machine learning task. Input features will include one-hot encoded vectors for the stressor, and quantitative features derived from the baseline (non-senescent) state of the cell type (e.g., expression of key lineage TFs, baseline chromatin accessibility at SASP gene loci). The output will be a vector of normalized expression values for a curated set of ~100 core SASP factors. We will train and compare multiple models, including XGBoost and deep neural networks, using a rigorous cross-validation framework.
*   **Model Validation and Interpretation:** The final model will be evaluated on a held-out test set of data not used during training or hyperparameter tuning. To understand the model's logic, we will employ interpretability techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each input feature to the prediction of each SASP factor's expression. This will reveal the key determinants of SASP composition.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   Year 1: Completion of data harmonization pipeline (M9); Release of first-generation transcriptomic Senescence Atlas (M12).
*   Year 2: Integration of multi-omic data into a refined Atlas (M18); Completion of subtype-specific GRN reconstruction (M24).
*   Year 3: Development and validation of the predictive SASP model (M30); Public launch of the web portal with all data and tools (M33); Submission of manuscripts and final report (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate transformative outcomes that will reshape our understanding of cellular senescence and provide the community with powerful new resources, directly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS research call. The impact will span fundamental biology, translational medicine, and the training of a new generation of scientists.

**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field:**
The primary outcome of this work will be a paradigm shift from viewing senescence as a monolithic process to understanding it as a complex, emergent system with multiple distinct and predictable phenotypic outputs. 
1.  **The Senescence Atlas:** This will be the first-of-its-kind, comprehensive, multi-omic map of senescent cell states. By providing a robust, data-driven taxonomy, the Atlas will establish a common language and reference framework for the entire field. It will resolve long-standing debates about senescence markers and enable researchers to precisely classify the types of senescent cells in their own experimental systems. This resource moves beyond a simple catalog by defining states based on integrated molecular signatures, revealing the deep principles of their organization.
2.  **Mechanistic Insights into Phenotypic Control:** Our inferred gene regulatory networks will provide concrete, testable hypotheses about the molecular machinery that governs senescent fate decisions. By identifying novel, context-specific master regulators and signaling hubs that control the SASP, we will open up entirely new avenues of investigation into the basic biology of senescence. This addresses a fundamental question in cellular biology: how do cells integrate diverse signals to produce a stable, complex phenotype?
3.  **A Predictive Engine for Geroscience:** The machine learning model for predicting SASP composition represents a novel capability for the field. It will function as a powerful hypothesis-generation tool, allowing researchers to perform *in silico* experiments to predict the consequences of a given drug or genetic perturbation on the secretome of a specific cell type. This will accelerate research by helping to prioritize experiments and interpret complex results.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The impact of this project extends far beyond basic science. 
*   **Advancing Therapeutic Strategies:** Our findings have direct translational relevance for age-related diseases. Current senolytic therapies risk eliminating senescent cells with beneficial functions. Our work will enable a more nuanced 'senomorphic' or 'SASP-modulatory' approach. By identifying the specific regulators of pathological SASP components, our work will pinpoint novel drug targets for therapies that can reprogram a harmful, pro-inflammatory SASP into a benign or even beneficial one. The predictive model could be used to stratify patients for clinical trials or to design personalized senotherapeutic interventions.
*   **An Enduring Community Resource:** A major deliverable is the creation of a public, interactive web portal. This portal will provide open access to all harmonized data, the Senescence Atlas, the inferred networks, and the predictive model. It will feature intuitive visualization and analysis tools, democratizing access to this complex synthesis project. This empowers researchers, including those at primarily undergraduate institutions or with limited computational resources, to query the data and explore their own hypotheses, thus catalyzing new research across the community.
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is an ideal training environment. Trainees will be immersed in a transdisciplinary, collaborative setting, gaining highly sought-after skills in big data analysis, cloud computing, network biology, and machine learning, applied to a critical biological problem. This directly addresses the call's objective to train the future data-savvy scientific workforce.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
We are fully committed to open science principles. All analysis scripts will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. All processed data and curated metadata will be deposited in a FAIR-compliant repository like Zenodo. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. We will present our work at national and international conferences and will host a final-year workshop to train the broader community on using our web portal and resources. This comprehensive dissemination strategy ensures that the project's outcomes will have a broad and lasting impact.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:** This project is perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission and cannot be accomplished through traditional funding mechanisms. The synthesis of hundreds of disparate public datasets requires a coordinated, multi-lab effort and dedicated personnel that is beyond the scope of a single R01. The project does not generate new data, but instead creates new knowledge from existing resources. Its focus on an emergent biological property (phenotypic heterogeneity), its transdisciplinary team, its commitment to open science and community resource building, and its integrated training plan all directly address the core tenets of the NCEMS research call. The requested resources are essential to support the personnel and computational infrastructure needed for this community-scale endeavor.",,
ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_02,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,Deconstructing the Grammar of Cellular Organization: Predicting Membraneless Organelles through Synthesis of Biophysical and Systems Data,"The discovery that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives the formation of membraneless organelles has transformed our understanding of cellular compartmentalization. These biomolecular condensates are critical for diverse functions, and their dysregulation is linked to diseases like neurodegeneration and cancer. However, the 'rules' governing which biomolecules enter which condensate remain elusive. This project will tackle this fundamental question by synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets to uncover the emergent 'grammar' of LLPS. We will assemble a working group of biophysicists, polymer physicists, cell biologists, and computational scientists to integrate sequence-level data (protein disorder, charge, valency from UniProt/Pfam), structural data (PDB), protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction networks (BioGRID, STRING, RBPDB), and cellular localization data (Human Protein Atlas). Using a combination of machine learning and network theory, we will develop a predictive framework that maps molecular features to emergent phase behavior. The primary goals are: 1) To create a comprehensive, annotated 'condensatome' database by systematically mining existing literature and datasets. 2) To develop a machine learning model that predicts the LLPS propensity of any protein or RNA and its likely partitioning into specific condensates based on its intrinsic features and cellular context (e.g., co-expression of interaction partners). 3) To model how post-translational modifications and changing cellular conditions dynamically regulate the composition and material properties of these organelles. This project moves beyond the capabilities of any single lab by requiring the integration of petabyte-scale, heterogeneous data and expertise spanning from theoretical physics to cell biology. The resulting predictive models and open-access resources will empower researchers to understand how emergent biophysical principles orchestrate cellular function and dysfunction.",,"Background And Significance

The eukaryotic cell is a paragon of emergent complexity, achieving robust function through the precise spatiotemporal organization of its molecular components. For over a century, this organization was thought to be primarily mediated by lipid membranes that enclose distinct organelles. However, a recent paradigm shift has revealed a second, orthogonal mode of compartmentalization: the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs), or biomolecular condensates, through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This physical process, driven by multivalent, weak interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, allows cells to rapidly concentrate specific molecules into dynamic, liquid-like droplets such as the nucleolus, P-bodies, and stress granules. These condensates are not passive depots; they are active microreactors that regulate fundamental processes including transcription, RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and stress response. The molecular drivers of LLPS are increasingly understood to be encoded in the primary sequences of proteins and RNAs. Features such as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), low-complexity domains (LCDs), RNA-binding motifs, and specific patterns of charge and aromatic residues confer the multivalency required for phase separation. Seminal work by Brangwynne, Hyman, Rosen, and others has established the biophysical foundations of this process, and a suite of computational tools (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE, FuzDrop) and databases (e.g., PhaSepDB, LLPSDB) have been developed to predict the LLPS propensity of individual proteins. Despite this progress, the field faces critical knowledge gaps that prevent a systems-level understanding of cellular organization. The most significant limitation is the 'specificity problem': while we can often predict *if* a protein will phase separate, we cannot predict *which* of the dozens of distinct condensates it will preferentially partition into. The molecular 'grammar' or 'zip code' that dictates specific MLO composition remains an outstanding puzzle. A second major gap is the 'context-dependency problem'. Cellular condensates are not static entities; they assemble, dissolve, and change composition in response to developmental cues, cell cycle progression, and environmental stress. This dynamism is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) and changes in component concentrations, yet current predictive models are largely static and context-agnostic. Finally, the relevant data required to solve these problems is vast but severely fragmented. Information on protein sequences, structures, interaction partners, cellular localization, expression levels, and PTMs is scattered across dozens of public databases. No single research group possesses the expertise or resources to integrate and synthesize this heterogeneous, petabyte-scale data into a coherent predictive framework. This project is both important and timely because it addresses these fundamental gaps at a unique confluence of data availability and conceptual need. Understanding the grammar of MLO assembly is essential for a complete picture of cellular function. Furthermore, the dysregulation of LLPS is increasingly implicated in devastating human diseases, including neurodegeneration (e.g., the pathological solidification of FUS or TDP-43 condensates in ALS) and cancer (e.g., aberrant phase separation driven by oncogenic fusion proteins). A predictive framework for MLO composition would be transformative for generating mechanistic hypotheses in these disease contexts. The explosion of public omics data, coupled with advances in machine learning, provides an unprecedented opportunity to tackle this challenge through a large-scale data synthesis effort, moving beyond the capacity of any single lab to reveal the emergent principles governing life's internal architecture.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research program is designed to systematically deconstruct the molecular grammar governing the assembly, composition, and dynamic regulation of membraneless organelles. Our work is organized around three central aims, each addressing a critical gap in the field through specific, testable hypotheses that leverage the synthesis of public data.

**Aim 1: To establish a unified, multi-scale 'condensatome' atlas by integrating heterogeneous public data.**
This aim addresses the foundational need for a comprehensive, evidence-based catalog of MLO components, which currently does not exist. 
*   **Research Question 1.1:** What is the complete, high-confidence repertoire of proteins and RNAs that constitute the major MLOs (e.g., nucleolus, stress granules, P-bodies, nuclear speckles) across human and model organisms?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A systematic, semi-automated integration of data from literature mining, MLO-specific proteomics, subcellular localization atlases, and biomolecular interaction networks can produce a 'condensatome' atlas of significantly greater scope and confidence than existing manually curated lists. 
*   **Expected Outcome & Validation:** We will deliver a publicly accessible database, the 'Condensatome Atlas,' containing thousands of MLO components, each with a confidence score based on the convergence of multiple lines of evidence. We will validate the quality of our newly identified components by demonstrating a statistically significant enrichment for known LLPS-driving biophysical features (e.g., intrinsic disorder, multivalency) compared to the background proteome, and by confirming co-localization patterns using independent imaging data.

**Aim 2: To develop a predictive framework that maps molecular features to condensate partitioning.**
This aim tackles the central 'specificity problem' by moving beyond simple propensity prediction to model the specific partitioning of biomolecules into distinct condensates.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Can a machine learning model, trained on integrated molecular and network features, learn the combinatorial 'rules' that determine a biomolecule's specific MLO destination?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** The partitioning of a protein or RNA into a specific condensate is an emergent property determined by a unique, multi-scale 'feature signature' encompassing its intrinsic sequence/domain properties (the 'letters') and its position within the cellular interaction network (the 'syntax'). A multi-modal machine learning model can decipher this complex grammar.
*   **Expected Outcome & Validation:** We will develop a novel computational tool that, given a protein or RNA sequence, predicts its partitioning probability across a range of MLOs. The model's performance will be rigorously assessed using cross-validation on held-out data, and its predictions will be benchmarked against newly published experimental data not used in training. Crucially, by using model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP), we will extract the key feature combinations that define the 'zip code' for each MLO, providing concrete, testable biological insights.

**Aim 3: To model the dynamic regulation of condensate composition and material properties.**
This aim addresses the 'context-dependency problem' by simulating how cellular signals remodel MLOs.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** How do post-translational modifications (PTMs) and changes in component stoichiometry dynamically regulate the composition, size, and predicted biophysical properties of MLOs?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** PTMs function as tunable molecular 'switches' that modify the valency and interaction strengths of MLO components, thereby altering phase boundaries and competitive partitioning. These dynamic effects can be computationally modeled by integrating PTM site data and context-specific gene expression data into our predictive framework.
*   **Expected Outcome & Validation:** We will create a dynamic simulation platform that predicts how MLOs are remodeled in response to specific cellular states (e.g., stress, mitosis). We will validate our model's predictions by comparing them against publicly available time-course proteomics and imaging datasets of MLOs under perturbation. For instance, our model should correctly predict the dissolution of certain condensates upon widespread phosphorylation during mitosis, a known biological phenomenon. This will provide the first quantitative framework for understanding the dynamic regulation of cellular compartmentalization.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group, leveraging a purely computational, data-synthesis approach that is perfectly aligned with the research call. Our methodology is structured around our three research aims and emphasizes collaboration, reproducibility, and open science principles.

**Working Group Structure and Collaboration Plan:**
The project's success hinges on the integration of diverse expertise. We will form a working group with three specialized sub-teams: 
1.  **Data Curation & Ontology Team:** Comprised of cell biologists and bioinformaticians, this team will lead Aim 1. They will use their domain knowledge to guide automated data extraction and ensure the biological relevance of the integrated 'Condensatome Atlas'.
2.  **Machine Learning & Modeling Team:** Led by computational scientists and biophysicists, this team will spearhead Aim 2. They will develop and implement the multi-modal machine learning architecture for predicting MLO partitioning.
3.  **Dynamic Systems & Physics Team:** Including systems biologists and theoretical physicists, this team will focus on Aim 3, developing models to simulate the dynamic regulation of condensates. 
Collaboration will be maintained through bi-weekly virtual meetings, a shared Slack workspace, and a centralized project management platform. All code and analysis pipelines will be version-controlled on a shared GitHub repository. An annual in-person workshop will be held to facilitate intensive brainstorming, cross-team training, and strategic planning.

**Aim 1: Building the 'Condensatome' Atlas**
*   **Data Sources:** We will exclusively use publicly available data. Key sources include: (i) **Literature:** The entire PubMed Central Open Access subset will be mined using NLP tools (e.g., BERN, PubTator) to extract protein/gene-MLO associations. (ii) **Proteomics:** Data from MLO purification-mass spectrometry studies will be aggregated from PRIDE, MassIVE, and CPTAC. (iii) **Localization:** The Human Protein Atlas, Compartments DB, and GO annotations will provide cellular location evidence. (iv) **Interactions:** Protein-protein interactions will be sourced from BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct. Protein-RNA interactions will be sourced from RBPDB, POSTAR3, and ENCODE eCLIP datasets. (v) **Gold Standards:** Known LLPS-driving proteins from PhaSepDB, LLPSDB, and DrLLPS will serve as positive controls and training seeds.
*   **Integration and Annotation:** We will construct a heterogeneous graph database (using Neo4j or similar) where nodes represent biomolecules and edges represent different types of evidence (e.g., 'co-localizes_with', 'interacts_with', 'co-mentioned_in_literature'). Each piece of evidence will be weighted, and a final confidence score for each molecule's association with a given MLO will be calculated using a Bayesian integration framework.

**Aim 2: Predictive Modeling of LLPS and Partitioning**
*   **Feature Engineering:** A comprehensive feature vector will be generated for every human protein. This vector will include: (i) **Sequence Features:** Amino acid composition, charge (SCD, κ), hydropathy, intrinsic disorder scores (from IUPred2A, MobiDB), low-complexity regions (from SEG), and patterns of aromatic/cationic residues. (ii) **Structural/Domain Features:** Pfam domain annotations, known interaction motifs (e.g., SH3, PRM), and structural properties derived from AlphaFold2 models (e.g., solvent accessible surface area). (iii) **Network Features:** Graph-based metrics (degree, centrality, clustering coefficient) derived from the interaction networks built in Aim 1.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** We will develop a multi-modal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This architecture is ideal as it can simultaneously learn from both the node features (sequence/structural properties) and the graph topology (interaction network). The model will be trained on the high-confidence atlas from Aim 1 to perform multi-class classification, assigning each protein to its most likely MLO. To decipher the 'grammar', we will employ model interpretability methods like SHAP and integrated gradients to identify the specific features that drive partitioning into each condensate class.

**Aim 3: Modeling Dynamic Regulation**
*   **Dynamic Data Integration:** We will augment our feature set by incorporating data from: (i) **PTM Databases:** PhosphoSitePlus and dbPTM will be used to map known modification sites onto our protein set. (ii) **Expression Atlases:** Context-specific protein and RNA abundance levels will be obtained from GTEx, TCGA, and relevant perturbation experiments in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
*   **Simulation Framework:** We will model dynamics by perturbing our trained GCN model. To simulate PTMs, we will alter the input features of a protein (e.g., adding negative charges to simulate phosphorylation) and observe the resulting change in its predicted MLO partitioning probability. To simulate changes in cellular context, we will use expression data to weight the nodes in our interaction graph. We can then use network propagation algorithms to predict how shifts in the abundance of key 'scaffold' proteins might sequester or release 'client' proteins, thereby remodeling the entire condensatome.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data integration pipeline and release of 'Condensatome Atlas' v1.0. First working group publication submitted.
*   **Year 2:** Development, training, and validation of the predictive GCN model. Launch of a public web server for MLO partitioning prediction. Second manuscript submitted.
*   **Year 3:** Development of the dynamic simulation framework. Integration of all tools into a unified open-source platform. Final summary publications and dissemination at international conferences.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will produce transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, with broad impacts on our understanding of human health and disease. The deliverables are designed to be foundational resources and tools that empower the entire scientific community, consistent with the collaborative and open-science ethos of the research call.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Foundational Community Resource:** The primary deliverable, the 'Condensatome Atlas,' will be the most comprehensive, evidence-based, and computationally accessible catalog of membraneless organelle components. By integrating disparate data types under a unified ontological framework, it will serve as a definitive reference for researchers studying MLOs, analogous to the role of the Gene Ontology (GO) or KEGG pathways for their respective fields. It will enable researchers to quickly survey the known and predicted components of their condensate of interest, generating novel hypotheses for experimental validation.
2.  **A New Predictive Paradigm:** Our project will deliver the first computational framework capable of predicting not just *if* a biomolecule undergoes LLPS, but *where* it partitions among the cell's diverse condensates. This moves the field from a descriptive to a predictive science. The machine learning model and its interpretation will reveal the combinatorial 'grammar'—the specific sequence, structural, and network motifs—that governs MLO assembly. This represents a fundamental breakthrough in understanding the emergent principles of cellular self-organization.
3.  **A Framework for Dynamic Cell Biology:** By modeling the effects of PTMs and changing cellular conditions, we will provide the first systems-level, quantitative tool to investigate the dynamic regulation of cellular compartmentalization. This will bridge the gap between static parts lists of condensates and the dynamic, responsive behavior of living cells, providing a powerful new lens to study processes like the stress response, cell division, and signaling.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Understanding Human Disease:** The dysregulation of MLOs is a hallmark of numerous diseases, including ALS, Alzheimer's, and various cancers. Our predictive tools will allow researchers to input disease-associated mutations (e.g., in FUS, TDP-43, or oncogenic fusion proteins) and predict how they alter MLO partitioning and properties. This will generate concrete, mechanistic hypotheses about disease pathogenesis and identify potential nodes for therapeutic intervention.
*   **Enabling Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** A predictive understanding of the MLO grammar will empower the rational design of synthetic organelles. Researchers will be able to engineer proteins with custom 'zip codes' to target them to specific condensates or to create entirely novel, orthogonal compartments for applications in metabolic engineering, bioremediation, and the construction of complex cellular circuits.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Data-Driven Biologists:** This project is an ideal training environment for graduate students and postdocs. Trainees will work in a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team, gaining invaluable skills at the intersection of cell biology, biophysics, and data science. They will become fluent in machine learning, network theory, and large-scale data integration—the critical toolkit for the future data-savvy workforce, directly fulfilling a key goal of the research call.

**Dissemination and Open Science Strategy:**
Our commitment to open science is unwavering. All deliverables will be made immediately and freely available to the community.
*   **Open Data:** The 'Condensatome Atlas' will be accessible via a user-friendly web portal with full search and download capabilities.
*   **Open Source:** All software, analysis pipelines, and machine learning models will be deposited in a public GitHub repository with permissive licenses and comprehensive documentation to ensure full reproducibility.
*   **Open Access:** The predictive model will be deployed as a public web server and API. All research findings will be published in high-impact open-access journals and disseminated through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ASCB, ISMB). We will also organize training workshops to help the broader community utilize our resources effectively.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research is a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of a single research laboratory and requires the unique support structure provided by NCEMS. The project does not require funds for experimental data generation; instead, the budget is focused on the personnel, computational resources, and collaborative infrastructure necessary to integrate and analyze vast, publicly available datasets.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:**
The central challenge of this project is not the lack of data, but its fragmentation and complexity. Solving the 'grammar' of cellular organization requires a transdisciplinary team of cell biologists, biophysicists, polymer physicists, and machine learning experts to work in a deeply integrated fashion. Such a team is rarely found within a single institution and requires a dedicated collaborative framework. NCEMS support is essential to convene this working group, providing the resources for dedicated personnel to focus on data synthesis, for the computational power to process petabytes of information, and for the travel and coordination needed to foster genuine intellectual synergy. Traditional funding mechanisms are often ill-suited for projects of this nature, which prioritize synthesis and collaboration over new data generation. This proposal is therefore perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission.

**Budget Breakdown (3-Year Project Estimate):**

**A. Personnel:**
*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2.0 FTE x 3 years):** Two full-time postdoctoral fellows will form the core of the project's analytical effort. Postdoc 1 (Bioinformatics/Cell Biology focus) will lead the development of the 'Condensatome Atlas' (Aim 1). Postdoc 2 (Computational/ML focus) will lead the development of the predictive and dynamic models (Aims 2 & 3). Their salaries and benefits are the largest component of the budget, reflecting the person-hours required for this intensive data synthesis work.
*   **Graduate Students (2.0 FTE x 3 years):** Two graduate students will be supported to assist the postdocs, providing them with unparalleled cross-disciplinary training in data science and cell biology. This directly supports the NCEMS goal of training the future workforce.
*   **Project Manager (0.25 FTE x 3 years):** A part-time project manager is critical for coordinating the multi-institutional working group, organizing meetings, managing the shared data and code repositories, and ensuring milestones are met.
*   **Senior Personnel (0.5 month summer salary/PI/year):** Modest summer support for the lead PIs will allow them to dedicate focused time to scientific oversight, trainee mentoring, and manuscript preparation.

**B. Travel:**
*   **Annual Working Group Meeting:** Funds are requested to bring all PIs, postdocs, and students together for one 3-day in-person workshop per year. These meetings are indispensable for fostering deep collaboration, resolving complex challenges, and strategic planning.
*   **Conference Dissemination:** Travel funds will support trainees in presenting project results at one major international conference each year, ensuring broad dissemination of our findings and resources.

**C. Other Direct Costs:**
*   **Computational Resources:** A significant allocation is required for cloud computing services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) to cover data storage, database hosting, and on-demand GPU access for training large-scale machine learning models.
*   **Publication Fees:** Funds are budgeted to cover open-access publication charges for an anticipated 3-4 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals.

This budget is structured to maximize the collaborative and synthesis-oriented goals of the project, focusing resources on the people and infrastructure needed to turn fragmented public data into fundamental biological knowledge.",,

A systems-level understanding of how distinct metabolic phenotypes emerge is critical for developing effective therapies. This working group proposes to build a Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States by synthesizing the wealth of public multi-omic cancer data. Our team, comprising cancer biologists, metabolomics experts, systems biologists, and data scientists, will integrate genomic (TCGA, ICGC), transcriptomic, proteomic (CPTAC), and metabolomic (Metabolomics Workbench) data from thousands of tumor samples across dozens of cancer types. The core of our approach is to move beyond correlative studies and build predictive, context-specific network models. We will use advanced computational methods to construct integrated networks that link genetic alterations (mutations, CNVs) to downstream changes in gene expression, protein abundance, and ultimately, metabolic flux. By analyzing the topology and dynamics of these networks, we will address fundamental questions: How do different oncogenic mutations converge on similar emergent metabolic phenotypes? What are the key network nodes that mediate the transition to an anabolic state? Can we identify metabolic liabilities that are emergent properties of the network itself, rather than a single mutated enzyme? This project will produce a comprehensive, queryable map of cancer metabolism, identify high-confidence metabolic vulnerabilities common to diverse cancer types, and develop an open-source computational pipeline for multi-omic data integration and network analysis. This resource will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine for the cancer research community and guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies.",,"Background And Significance

The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a foundational hallmark of cancer, enabling the rapid proliferation and survival of tumor cells in diverse microenvironments. First described by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, this phenomenon involves a complex rewiring of metabolic pathways to meet the increased demand for ATP, biosynthetic precursors, and redox homeostasis. While the Warburg effect—the preference for aerobic glycolysis—is a well-known example, it is now clear that cancer metabolic reprogramming is far more nuanced and heterogeneous. It encompasses alterations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutaminolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and lipid and nucleotide synthesis. This metabolic plasticity is not a monolithic entity but an emergent property arising from a complex interplay between a tumor's genetic drivers (e.g., mutations in TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA), its tissue of origin, and signals from the tumor microenvironment. Understanding the principles that govern this emergence is one of the most significant challenges in cancer biology and a critical step toward developing more effective, targeted metabolic therapies. 

The last decade has witnessed an explosion in publicly available, large-scale cancer datasets, providing an unprecedented opportunity to dissect this complexity. Landmark projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have characterized the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of thousands of tumors across dozens of cancer types. More recently, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has added a crucial layer of proteomic data, offering a more direct proxy for enzymatic activity. Concurrently, repositories like the Metabolomics Workbench have begun to aggregate tumor metabolomic profiles. While these resources are invaluable, they are frequently analyzed in isolation. Most studies have focused on identifying correlations between a specific mutation and a downstream metabolic alteration within a single cancer type. This approach, while informative, has several key limitations. First, it often fails to capture the non-linear, systems-level effects through which genetic perturbations propagate through transcriptional and proteomic layers to ultimately reshape the metabolic network. Second, it struggles to explain how genetically distinct tumors can converge on similar metabolic phenotypes. Third, it may overlook therapeutic vulnerabilities that are not caused by the inhibition of a single mutated enzyme but are instead emergent properties of the rewired network—so-called 'network fragilities'.

A critical gap in the field is the lack of a unified, pan-cancer framework to systematically map and classify these emergent metabolic states. We need to move beyond correlational analyses and build predictive models that mechanistically link genotype to metabolic phenotype. Such a framework would allow us to understand the common principles of metabolic reprogramming that transcend specific cancer types and driver mutations. This research is exceptionally timely. The maturation of multi-omic datasets, coupled with advances in network biology, machine learning, and constraint-based modeling, provides the necessary ingredients for a large-scale data synthesis project. A community-scale effort, as proposed here, is essential because the integration and analysis of these massive, heterogeneous datasets are beyond the scope and expertise of any single research lab. By assembling a multidisciplinary team of cancer biologists, systems biologists, and data scientists, this working group is uniquely positioned to synthesize existing public data to construct a Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States. This atlas will serve as a transformative resource for the community, providing a systems-level map of cancer metabolism, generating novel hypotheses, and identifying high-confidence therapeutic targets that are currently hidden within the complexity of multi-omic data.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The central goal of this working group is to systematically define and characterize the emergent metabolic states that arise in cancer and to leverage this understanding to predict novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. Our research is structured around three fundamental questions, each associated with a specific, testable hypothesis that will be addressed through the synthesis of public multi-omic data and the application of advanced network modeling techniques.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): How do diverse oncogenic drivers and tissue-of-origin contexts converge to produce a finite set of recurrent, emergent metabolic states across different cancer types?**
While the genomic landscape of cancer is extraordinarily diverse, the functional requirements for proliferation—such as biomass production and energy generation—are conserved. This suggests that the vast number of possible genetic and epigenetic alterations may converge on a more limited set of stable, functional metabolic phenotypes. 
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** Despite vast genomic heterogeneity, cancer metabolism converges on a limited number of discrete and recurrent metabolic states (e.g., 'High-Glycolytic/Low-OXPHOS', 'Lipogenic', 'Glutamine-Addicted'). These states are emergent properties defined by the collective activity of the entire metabolic network, rather than being dictated by a single driver mutation or tissue of origin.
*   **Testing H1:** We will integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from thousands of pan-cancer tumor samples to generate a high-dimensional feature space representing the metabolic activity of each tumor. Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., consensus clustering, variational autoencoders), we will identify robust clusters of tumors that represent distinct metabolic states. We will then characterize these states by their dominant metabolic pathway activities and metabolite signatures. Our prediction is that tumors with disparate driver mutations (e.g., KRAS-mutant lung cancer and PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer) will co-cluster if their mutations perturb the underlying regulatory and metabolic network in a functionally convergent manner. The primary deliverable will be a comprehensive classification of pan-cancer metabolic states.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the key molecular mediators and network control points that govern the stability of cancer-associated metabolic phenotypes?**
Understanding how cancer cells maintain a robustly altered metabolic state is key to identifying effective therapeutic strategies. We posit that these stable states are maintained by critical nodes within the integrated molecular network that act as control points.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** The stability of each emergent metabolic state is governed by a small set of 'hub' nodes (genes, proteins, or metabolites) within the integrated multi-omic network. These hubs, characterized by high network centrality, act as crucial mediators that integrate oncogenic signals and control metabolic flux, and are not necessarily the most mutated or differentially expressed components.
*   **Testing H2:** For each identified metabolic state, we will construct context-specific interaction networks that link genomic alterations to proteomic and metabolic changes. Using network topology analysis (e.g., calculating betweenness centrality, degree, and control centrality), we will identify putative hub nodes. We will then perform in silico perturbation analyses (e.g., simulating the removal of a node) to assess the impact of these hubs on the overall network stability and predicted metabolic output. We predict that perturbation of these hubs will cause a disproportionately large disruption to the cancer metabolic state compared to non-hub nodes. The deliverable will be a map of the key control points for each metabolic state.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can we identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities that are emergent properties of the network, representing metabolic liabilities specific to each state, regardless of cancer type?**
The ultimate goal is to translate our systems-level understanding into therapeutic hypotheses. A metabolic state-based classification offers a new paradigm for patient stratification.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** Tumors classified within the same emergent metabolic state will share common metabolic dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically. These vulnerabilities are emergent properties of the rewired network and can be predicted by identifying nodes whose inhibition is synthetically lethal with the network configuration of a specific metabolic state.
*   **Testing H3:** We will employ constraint-based modeling (e.g., Flux Balance Analysis) on our context-specific network models to simulate the functional consequences of gene/enzyme inhibition. For each metabolic state, we will perform genome-scale in silico 'knockout' screens to identify genes whose deletion is predicted to be selectively lethal (e.g., by blocking biomass production). To validate our predictions computationally, we will cross-reference our findings with experimental data from large-scale dependency screens like the DepMap project. We predict a significant enrichment of our high-confidence predicted targets among the essential genes identified experimentally in cell lines belonging to the corresponding metabolic state. The final deliverable will be a prioritized list of high-confidence, state-specific metabolic targets for future experimental validation.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed as a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary working group, leveraging the unique expertise of its members in cancer biology, metabolomics, systems biology, and data science. Our approach is organized into four sequential but interconnected phases, designed to systematically synthesize public data to build and analyze a Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States. This project will not generate new experimental data, adhering strictly to the research call's focus on data synthesis.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonized Integration (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase addresses the significant challenge of integrating diverse, large-scale public datasets. 
*   **Data Sources:** We will aggregate data from premier public repositories. Genomic data (somatic mutations, copy number variations) will be sourced from TCGA and ICGC. Transcriptomic data (RNA-Seq) will be obtained from the TCGA portal. Proteomic data (global and phosphoproteomic) will be sourced from CPTAC. Metabolomic data will be gathered from the Metabolomics Workbench and other public sources, including data from published pan-cancer metabolomic studies. We will initially focus on tumor types with overlapping data across at least three 'omic' layers.
*   **Data Harmonization:** A dedicated team of data scientists, in consultation with domain experts, will perform rigorous data processing. This includes: (1) mapping all samples to a common, consistent patient/sample identifier system; (2) applying standardized data normalization procedures (e.g., TPM for RNA-Seq, z-scoring for proteomics/metabolomics); (3) implementing robust methods for handling missing values, such as k-nearest neighbor or Bayesian imputation, after careful evaluation of missingness patterns; and (4) mapping all molecular identifiers (genes, proteins, metabolites) to unified namespaces (e.g., Ensembl, UniProt, HMDB/KEGG).

**Phase 2: Context-Specific Multi-Omic Network Reconstruction (Months 7-18)**
Our core methodological innovation is the move from static, generic networks to dynamic, context-specific models for each tumor sample or small, homogeneous tumor cluster.
*   **Network Scaffolding:** We will begin with a comprehensive human network scaffold integrating protein-protein interactions, signaling pathways, transcriptional regulation, and a genome-scale metabolic model (e.g., Recon3D). This scaffold represents the superset of all possible interactions.
*   **Network Contextualization:** For each tumor sample, we will use its specific multi-omic data to tailor this generic scaffold. Transcriptomic and proteomic data will be used to infer the activity of specific pathways and the abundance of enzymes, effectively weighting or pruning edges in the network. Algorithms like iMAT or GIMME will be used to generate metabolic models that are consistent with the molecular profile of the tumor. Genomic data (mutations, CNVs) will be used to model the functional consequences of genetic alterations, such as the complete removal of a node for a loss-of-function mutation.
*   **Integrative Network Inference:** To mechanistically link driver mutations to metabolic outputs, we will employ network-based integration algorithms like Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest (PCSF). This method identifies the most relevant subnetwork connecting known genetic alterations ('prizes') to observed changes in the proteome or metabolome, revealing the most probable signaling and regulatory pathways involved.

**Phase 3: Identification and Characterization of Emergent Metabolic States (Months 19-24)**
With a collection of context-specific networks, we will identify recurrent patterns of metabolic organization across the pan-cancer cohort.
*   **Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction:** From each tumor-specific network, we will extract a rich set of features, including predicted metabolic pathway fluxes, node centrality measures, and pathway enrichment scores. We will use dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP or PCA to visualize the landscape of cancer metabolism.
*   **Unsupervised Clustering:** We will apply consensus clustering to these features to robustly partition tumors into distinct metabolic states (testing H1). The optimal number of clusters will be determined using multiple statistical metrics (e.g., silhouette score, cophenetic correlation).
*   **State Characterization:** Each resulting cluster will be deeply characterized by identifying its defining molecular and network features, linking it back to driver mutations, tissue of origin, and clinical outcomes (testing H2).

**Phase 4: Vulnerability Prediction and Computational Validation (Months 25-30)**
This phase will translate our network models into testable therapeutic hypotheses.
*   **In Silico Perturbation Screening:** Using our context-specific metabolic models, we will perform systematic in silico gene knockout simulations via Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and related methods (e.g., MOMA). We will define a cancer-specific objective function (e.g., maximizing biomass production) and identify genes whose deletion is predicted to be selectively lethal for each metabolic state (testing H3).
*   **Computational Validation:** We will validate our predictions against orthogonal experimental data. Specifically, we will compare our list of predicted vulnerabilities for each state with gene dependency scores from the DepMap project and drug sensitivity data from GDSC, stratifying cell lines by their corresponding metabolic state. A statistically significant overlap will provide strong computational validation for our approach.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data harmonization pipeline (M6). Release of the integrated, curated pan-cancer dataset (M12). First-generation context-specific networks for 10 cancer types (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Completion of pan-cancer network reconstruction (M18). Publication manuscript on the classification and characterization of emergent metabolic states (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Completion of vulnerability prediction and validation pipeline (M30). Public launch of the interactive Pan-Cancer Atlas web portal (M30). Final manuscript on predicted metabolic liabilities (M36).

**Open Science and Training:** All software and analysis pipelines will be developed in a version-controlled environment (GitHub) and released under an open-source license. All derived data products and the final Atlas will be made publicly available. Trainees will be integral to all project phases, participating in bi-weekly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops, and collaborative 'code-a-thons', ensuring they receive comprehensive training in data synthesis, network biology, and reproducible science.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce a suite of transformative resources and fundamental new insights into cancer metabolism, with significant and lasting impact on both basic and translational cancer research. Our expected outcomes are tangible, impactful, and directly aligned with the research call's mission to catalyze community-scale data synthesis.

**Key Deliverables and Scientific Contributions:**
1.  **The Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States:** The primary outcome will be a comprehensive, publicly accessible resource that provides a systems-level map of cancer metabolism. This Atlas will be more than a static database; it will be an interactive web portal where researchers can explore the classification of metabolic states, visualize the underlying multi-omic data, query the network models for specific genes or pathways, and examine predicted vulnerabilities across dozens of cancer types. This will be the first resource of its kind to systematically classify functional metabolic phenotypes on a pan-cancer scale, moving the field beyond single-gene, single-cancer analyses.
2.  **A Validated, Open-Source Computational Pipeline:** We will deliver a robust, reproducible, and well-documented computational workflow for the integration of multi-omic data and the construction and analysis of context-specific network models. This pipeline will be a valuable asset for the broader scientific community, enabling other research groups to apply similar systems-level analyses to their own data, not only in cancer but in other complex diseases. This directly addresses the call's goal to develop innovative analytical strategies.
3.  **Fundamental Insights into Metabolic Reprogramming:** Our analysis will yield novel biological knowledge about the principles governing metabolic reprogramming. By identifying convergent metabolic states, we will uncover the common functional endpoints that are selected for during tumorigenesis, regardless of the specific initiating oncogenic event. The identification of network hubs and control points will elucidate the mechanisms that maintain the stability of these altered metabolic states, providing a deeper understanding of cancer's robustness.
4.  **A Prioritized Compendium of Novel Therapeutic Hypotheses:** The project will generate a high-confidence list of predicted metabolic vulnerabilities, stratified by our novel classification of emergent metabolic states. These predictions, computationally validated against large-scale experimental screens, will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine for the cancer biology and drug development communities. This outcome has the potential to directly guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies and inform patient stratification strategies for clinical trials.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Advancing Precision Oncology:** Our work will pioneer a new paradigm for patient stratification. Instead of relying solely on genomic markers, clinicians may one day classify tumors based on their functional metabolic state, allowing for the selection of therapies that target the specific metabolic wiring of a patient's tumor. This functional approach could improve therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance to conventional treatments.
*   **Fostering Collaborative, Open Science:** This project is a model for the type of community-scale, collaborative science that is necessary to tackle the complexity of modern biological data. By adhering to open science principles—making all data, code, and results publicly available—we will empower the entire research community, democratize access to complex analytical tools, and ensure the reproducibility and extension of our work.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Scientists:** Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) are central to our working group. They will receive immersive, hands-on training at the intersection of cancer biology, computational biology, and data science. Through collaborative projects, dedicated workshops, and interaction with a multidisciplinary team of mentors, they will develop the skills necessary to lead the next wave of data-driven biomedical research, fulfilling a key objective of the research call.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-faceted, including high-impact publications, presentations at international conferences (e.g., AACR, ISMB), and the development of the user-friendly Atlas web portal. We will also host workshops to train external researchers on our tools. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to be a living resource, continually updated as new public datasets become available (e.g., single-cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics). The foundational framework we develop can be readily adapted to study metabolic dysregulation in other complex diseases, ensuring the project's lasting impact and sustainability beyond the funding period.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the capabilities of a single research laboratory or existing collaboration. The sheer volume of data, the complexity of the required computational pipeline, and the necessity for deep, integrated expertise from multiple scientific domains (cancer biology, metabolomics, systems biology, data science) mandate the formation of a dedicated, funded Working Group. NCEMS support is essential to provide the protected time for personnel, the computational infrastructure, and the collaborative framework required to execute this ambitious project successfully. The budget outlined below is designed to support a three-year project, enabling us to deliver the proposed Pan-Cancer Atlas and its associated resources.

**Budget Justification:**

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_04,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,Emergence of a Superorganism: Synthesizing Multi-Kingdom Data to Model Host-Microbiome Metabolic Networks,"The human gut is a complex ecosystem where host and microbial metabolisms are deeply intertwined, giving rise to an emergent 'superorganism' with profound implications for health and disease. Understanding this metabolic codependence requires integrating data across biological kingdoms at a scale unachievable by a single lab. This working group will bring together microbiologists, immunologists, nutrition scientists, and computational biologists to construct a comprehensive, predictive model of the host-microbiome metabolic network. We will synthesize three major types of public data: 1) Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from large-scale cohorts (e.g., Human Microbiome Project, American Gut Project) to define the microbial community's functional potential and activity. 2) Host tissue-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data (e.g., GTEx, Human Protein Atlas) to define the host's metabolic capacity. 3) Public metabolomic data from blood and stool to provide system-level metabolic readouts. Our central strategy involves reconstructing thousands of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for individual gut microbes and integrating them with a human gut epithelial cell model. This community-scale modeling will allow us to simulate how dietary inputs are processed and how metabolic cross-feeding between microbes and between the microbiome and the host gives rise to the systemic metabolite profile. We will use this framework to predict the production of key signaling molecules (e.g., SCFAs, secondary bile acids) from microbiome composition, identify keystone species whose metabolic functions are critical for network stability, and simulate the emergent systemic effects of perturbations like antibiotic treatment or dietary shifts. This project will provide a foundational, quantitative understanding of our metabolic symbiosis and create a powerful in silico platform for designing personalized nutritional and therapeutic interventions.",,"Background And Significance

The human gut microbiome, a dense and diverse community of trillions of microorganisms, functions as a metabolic organ that is integral to host physiology. The concept of the human and their microbiome as a 'superorganism' or 'holobiont' has emerged from the recognition that host and microbial metabolisms are deeply and inextricably linked. This metabolic codependence is a classic example of an emergent phenomenon, where system-level properties, such as immune homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and disease resistance, arise from complex, multi-scale interactions that are not apparent from studying the host or microbes in isolation. The metabolic cross-talk between the host and gut microbiota is mediated by a vast array of molecules. Microbes ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, propionate, and acetate, which serve as a primary energy source for colonocytes and act as crucial signaling molecules that modulate host immunity and metabolism. Similarly, microbes transform host-derived primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, which regulate lipid metabolism and gut barrier function through receptors like FXR and TGR5. In turn, the host provides a nutrient-rich environment, secreting mucus glycans and other substrates that shape the microbial community structure. Disruptions in this metabolic symbiosis, termed dysbiosis, are implicated in a wide range of pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even neurological disorders. Despite the clear importance of this metabolic interplay, our understanding remains largely descriptive and correlational. A central challenge is the system's immense complexity. The human gut harbors hundreds of microbial species, each with a unique metabolic repertoire encoded by thousands of genes, interacting with a metabolically sophisticated host. Traditional experimental approaches, while essential, are often low-throughput and struggle to capture the system-wide dynamics. Computational modeling, specifically genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs), offers a powerful framework for addressing this complexity. GEMs are mathematical representations of an organism's entire metabolic network, and constraint-based modeling techniques like Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) can predict metabolic fluxes and growth rates under specific environmental conditions. In recent years, GEMs have been successfully constructed for individual gut microbes and have been extended to model simple microbial communities. Seminal works by Sung et al. (2017) and Heinken et al. (2019) have demonstrated the utility of community metabolic modeling in predicting metabolic interactions and SCFA production. However, these efforts face significant limitations. First, they often rely on a limited number of reference genomes, failing to capture the vast strain-level diversity present in the human gut. Second, and most critically, existing models rarely integrate a dynamic, tissue-specific host model. They typically treat the host as a static source of inputs and sink for outputs, ignoring the bidirectional feedback and metabolic co-regulation that define the superorganism. This leaves a critical knowledge gap: we lack a comprehensive, integrated, multi-kingdom modeling framework capable of predicting how diet and microbiome composition interact to produce an emergent systemic metabolic phenotype. This project is timely and significant because it directly addresses this gap. The recent explosion of publicly available multi-omics data—including thousands of metagenomes, host tissue-specific transcriptomes, and large-scale metabolomic profiles—provides an unprecedented opportunity for data synthesis. By integrating these disparate datasets, we can move beyond modeling microbes in isolation and construct a truly holistic model of the host-microbiome superorganism. Such a model is essential for transitioning from correlation to causation in microbiome research and for developing a mechanistic understanding of how this symbiosis shapes human health and disease.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is designed to address fundamental questions about the emergent metabolic properties of the host-microbiome superorganism. By synthesizing vast, publicly available multi-kingdom data into a unified computational framework, we will move beyond correlational studies to generate and test mechanistic hypotheses about metabolic codependence. Our research is structured around three central questions, each with specific, testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: How do inter-kingdom metabolic dependencies and cross-feeding networks determine the systemic metabolite profile?**
We posit that the concentrations of key metabolites in circulation and stool are not simply additive contributions from host and microbe, but emergent properties of a highly structured metabolic network. This leads to our first hypothesis:
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** The production of critical signaling metabolites, such as secondary bile acids and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is contingent upon multi-step, inter-species, and inter-kingdom metabolic pathways. We predict that our integrated model will show that no single microbe, nor the host alone, can efficiently produce the observed profile of these metabolites from a standard dietary input. Instead, the model will reveal specific metabolic handoffs, where, for example, Firmicutes species perform the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates, Bacteroides species ferment the resulting oligosaccharides to propionate, and other species convert host-derived primary bile acids into signaling molecules like deoxycholic acid.
*   **Validation:** We will test this hypothesis by simulating metabolic flux through the integrated network under a defined 'average Western diet' input. The model's predicted output of stool and systemic (absorbable) metabolites will be quantitatively compared against measured concentrations from public metabolomic datasets (e.g., from the American Gut Project cohorts). A strong correlation between predicted and observed metabolite profiles will support our hypothesis. We will further perform in silico 'tracer' experiments, tracking the flow of specific atoms (e.g., carbon from dietary fiber) through the network to explicitly map the predicted cross-feeding pathways.

**Research Question 2: Can we identify keystone species or guilds whose metabolic functions are disproportionately critical for the stability and function of the entire host-microbiome metabolic network?**
The concept of 'keystone species' is well-established in macro-ecology, but its application to the microbiome is often based on abundance or phylogenetic position. We propose a functional definition based on metabolic contribution.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** The stability of the host-microbiome metabolic network relies on a small subset of 'keystone' organisms or functional guilds that perform non-redundant, rate-limiting metabolic transformations. We predict that the in silico removal of these specific organisms (e.g., primary fiber degraders like *Bifidobacterium longum* or hydrogen-consuming methanogens) will cause a systemic collapse or significant alteration in the network's output, far greater than the removal of more metabolically redundant species. This disruption will manifest as a sharp decrease in the production of key metabolites like butyrate and an accumulation of intermediate metabolites.
*   **Validation:** We will systematically perform single-species 'knockout' simulations in our community model. For each simulation, we will quantify the change in the overall community metabolic output (e.g., total SCFA production, vitamin biosynthesis) and the flux distribution across the entire network. Species whose removal causes a statistically significant and disproportionately large impact on these system-level metrics will be identified as keystone species. The predicted metabolic impact of removing these keystones (e.g., loss of butyrate) will be compared to clinical data from studies involving targeted antibiotic treatments that are known to eliminate specific microbial groups.

**Research Question 3: How do clinically relevant perturbations, such as dietary shifts or antibiotic administration, propagate through the integrated metabolic network to alter systemic metabolic states?**
A truly predictive model must be able to simulate the system's response to external pressures. We will use our framework to explore the emergent consequences of such perturbations.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** The metabolic consequences of dietary and antibiotic perturbations are predictable outcomes of network-level flux redistributions. Specifically, we predict that: (a) shifting the model's dietary input from a low-fiber to a high-fiber composition will increase the total flux towards SCFA production by over 50% and shift the butyrate/propionate ratio, consistent with clinical observations. (b) Simulating broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment by removing all susceptible species from the model will lead to a >90% reduction in fiber degradation and secondary bile acid synthesis, creating a predicted 'vacant' metabolic niche that can be exploited by opportunistic pathogens like *Clostridioides difficile* if its GEM is introduced.
*   **Validation:** The predictions from these perturbation simulations will be validated against public datasets from human intervention studies. For diet, we will use data from controlled feeding studies that report changes in fecal SCFA levels in response to fiber supplementation. For antibiotics, we will use multi-omics data from cohorts undergoing antibiotic therapy, comparing our model's predicted changes in the metabolome with the actual measured changes.

Methods And Approach

This project will synthesize publicly available data using a multi-phase, systems biology approach, culminating in a predictive in silico model of the host-microbiome metabolic network. Our methodology is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and scalable, fully embracing open science principles. The working group's diverse expertise in microbiology, immunology, nutrition, and computational biology is essential for the successful execution of each phase.

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Aggregation and Curation (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase involves gathering and standardizing the disparate public datasets required for model construction and validation. We will not generate any new experimental data.
*   **Microbial Genomics Data:** We will source thousands of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and reference genomes of human gut microbes from public repositories like NCBI GenBank, the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, and curated datasets from large-scale cohort studies such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT. This will ensure our models capture a broad and representative sample of the microbial diversity.
*   **Host Omics Data:** To contextualize the host side of the model, we will utilize tissue-specific transcriptomic data for the transverse colon and terminal ileum from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. This data will inform which metabolic reactions are active in gut epithelial cells. This will be supplemented with protein abundance data from the Human Protein Atlas to further refine the host metabolic network.
*   **Metagenomic and Metatranscriptomic Data:** We will download processed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from cohorts like HMP and the American Gut Project (AGP). This data will be used to determine the relative abundance of microbial species and the expression levels of their metabolic genes in different individuals, allowing us to create personalized or population-level community models.
*   **Metabolomics Data:** For model validation, we will curate publicly available targeted and untargeted metabolomic data from human stool and blood samples from repositories like MetaboLights and the NIH Common Fund's Metabolomics Workbench. We will focus on datasets that have accompanying microbiome and dietary data to enable direct comparison with our model's predictions.

**Phase 2: Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GEM) Reconstruction (Months 4-15)**
We will construct a comprehensive library of high-quality GEMs for both microbial species and the human host.
*   **Microbial GEMs:** Using the curated genomes from Phase 1, we will employ an automated, high-throughput pipeline to reconstruct thousands of microbial GEMs. We will primarily use the CarveMe software, which leverages a universal model of prokaryotic metabolism to 'carve' species-specific models based on genomic evidence. Each reconstructed model will be subjected to quality control, including gap-filling to ensure biomass production and manual curation for key pathways (e.g., SCFA production) based on literature evidence. This library of models will be a major deliverable of our project.
*   **Host GEM:** We will adapt the latest human metabolic reconstruction, Recon3D, to create a specific model for a human colonocyte. We will use the GIMME algorithm (Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism and Expression) along with the GTEx transcriptomic and Human Protein Atlas proteomic data to prune the generic human model, retaining only the reactions and pathways expressed in gut epithelial tissue. This tissue-specific model will be crucial for accurately representing host-microbe metabolic exchange.

**Phase 3: Integrated Host-Microbiome Community Model Assembly (Months 12-24)**
This phase involves integrating the individual GEMs into a cohesive, multi-kingdom community model.
*   **Community Modeling Framework:** We will use the MICOM (Microbial Community Modeling) framework, a Python-based tool specifically designed for modeling large-scale microbial communities. For a given individual's metagenomic data, MICOM assembles a community model by including the GEMs of all detected species, weighted by their relative abundance.
*   **Host-Microbe Integration:** We will extend the standard community modeling approach by explicitly coupling the microbial community model with our colonocyte host model. This will be achieved by creating a shared 'lumen' compartment and a 'host' compartment, linked by transport reactions across the epithelial barrier. These reactions will represent the uptake of microbial-produced metabolites (e.g., SCFAs, vitamins) by the host and the secretion of host-derived substrates (e.g., mucus components, primary bile acids) into the lumen. The stoichiometry and directionality of these exchange reactions will be constrained based on known physiological parameters and literature.

**Phase 4: Simulation, Hypothesis Testing, and Validation (Months 20-36)**
With the integrated model assembled, we will perform simulations to test our hypotheses.
*   **Simulation Engine:** We will use constraint-based modeling techniques, primarily Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), to predict steady-state metabolic flux distributions. The objective function will be to maximize the growth rates of all organisms in the community, a common assumption in microbiome modeling.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** 
    *   **H1 (Cross-feeding):** We will define a simulated dietary input based on average nutrient composition of a Western diet and run FBA. We will analyze the predicted exchange fluxes between species and between the community and the host to map the metabolic handoffs. The predicted fecal and absorbed metabolite profiles will be correlated with curated metabolomics data for validation.
    *   **H2 (Keystone Species):** We will perform systematic single-species removal simulations. For each removal, we will re-run the FBA and calculate the resulting change in key community metabolic outputs. Statistical analysis will identify species whose removal leads to an outlier effect size.
    *   **H3 (Perturbations):** We will simulate dietary shifts by altering the nutrient composition of the model's input 'media'. Antibiotic effects will be simulated by removing classes of organisms known to be susceptible to specific antibiotics. The predicted changes in metabolite outputs will be compared to data from corresponding human intervention studies.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data aggregation (M6). Establish and benchmark the microbial GEM reconstruction pipeline (M9). Deliver a library of >1,000 curated microbial GEMs (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Complete host model contextualization (M18). Develop and validate the integrated host-microbiome modeling framework (M21). Perform initial simulations and validation for H1 (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Conduct systematic knockout simulations for H2 (M30). Complete perturbation simulations for H3 (M33). Finalize data analysis, prepare manuscripts, and publicly release all models, code, and workflows (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to the fields of molecular and cellular biology, microbiology, and systems medicine. By addressing the fundamental challenge of metabolic emergence in the host-microbiome superorganism, our work will shift the paradigm from descriptive association to mechanistic prediction. The expected outcomes are tangible, impactful, and designed for broad dissemination and long-term utility, directly aligning with the research call's goals of stimulating cross-disciplinary collaboration, leveraging public data, and training the next generation of data-savvy scientists.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A First-in-Class Integrated Host-Microbiome Metabolic Model:** The primary scientific outcome will be a robust, open-source computational platform that integrates thousands of microbial metabolic models with a tissue-specific human gut model. This will be the most comprehensive in silico representation of the superorganism's metabolic network to date, providing an unprecedented tool for the research community to explore the mechanistic basis of this critical symbiosis.
2.  **A Curated Library of Gut Microbe GEMs:** We will generate and publicly release thousands of high-quality, curated genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for human gut microbes, including many previously unmodeled species derived from MAGs. This resource will be invaluable for researchers studying the metabolism of specific microbes or communities, independent of the integrated model.
3.  **Mechanistic Insights into Metabolic Emergence:** Our simulations will provide concrete, testable predictions about the emergent properties of the host-microbiome system. We will identify specific cross-feeding pathways, pinpoint functionally-defined keystone species, and quantitatively map how perturbations like diet propagate through the network. This will provide a foundational, quantitative understanding of our metabolic symbiosis, moving beyond correlation to elucidate causal mechanisms.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The impact of this work will extend far beyond basic science. The predictive power of our modeling platform has significant translational potential:
*   **Personalized Nutrition:** The model can be used as an in silico testbed to predict an individual's metabolic response to different dietary interventions based on their unique microbiome composition. This could pave the way for rationally designed diets to optimize health or manage chronic diseases.
*   **Therapeutic Development:** By understanding the metabolic functions of the microbiome, our platform can help design next-generation probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics. For example, it could identify which specific microbes are needed to restore a critical metabolic function (e.g., butyrate production) in a dysbiotic gut.
*   **Diagnostics and Biomarker Discovery:** The model can help identify novel metabolic biomarkers for gut health or disease. By simulating disease-associated microbiome states, we can predict unique metabolic signatures that could be developed into non-invasive diagnostic tests.

**Dissemination, Open Science, and Training:**
In full alignment with the research call's requirements, we are committed to open science principles. 
*   **Dissemination Plan:** Findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. We will present our work at key international conferences (e.g., ISMB, Keystone Symposia on the Microbiome). 
*   **Open Science:** All reconstructed models (in SBML format), simulation code (in Python notebooks), and analysis workflows will be made publicly available through version-controlled repositories like GitHub and permanently archived on Zenodo with a permissive license. This ensures full reproducibility and allows other researchers to build upon our work.
*   **Training the Next Generation:** The project is structured to provide exceptional training opportunities. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the core of the working group, receiving hands-on, cross-disciplinary training in computational biology, systems modeling, and big data analysis. They will participate in collaborative coding sessions, regular multi-lab virtual meetings, and annual in-person workshops, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-driven workforce.

**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**
This project will establish a foundational platform and a collaborative network that will persist beyond the funding period. The open-source nature of the model will allow for its continuous expansion and refinement by the broader scientific community. Future work could involve integrating other biological layers, such as regulatory networks, immune signaling, and spatial organization, to create an even more comprehensive 'digital twin' of the human gut ecosystem. This working group will catalyze new collaborations, leading to follow-up projects that apply the model to specific diseases like IBD, colorectal cancer, or metabolic syndrome, ensuring the long-term impact and sustainability of this initial investment.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory. It requires a dedicated, multidisciplinary team with expertise spanning computational biology, microbiology, and human physiology, as well as significant computational resources for large-scale modeling. The budget reflects the personnel effort, computational infrastructure, and collaborative activities essential for the project's success. The total requested budget for the 36-month project period is $985,000.

**1. Personnel ($600,000):**
The majority of the budget is allocated to personnel, who will drive the data synthesis, model development, and analysis. This team is critical for integrating the diverse datasets and performing the complex simulations required.
*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2.0 FTE for 3 years):** We request support for two postdoctoral fellows who will be the primary drivers of the project. One fellow will have expertise in systems biology and metabolic modeling, leading the GEM reconstruction and simulation efforts. The second fellow will have a background in microbiology and bioinformatics, leading the curation of genomic and metagenomic data. Their combined expertise is essential for bridging the computational and biological aspects of the project. (Estimated cost: $80,000/year/fellow including benefits = $480,000).
*   **Graduate Student Researchers (2 students, 50% effort for 3 years):** We request stipend and tuition support for two graduate students. They will be mentored by the PIs and postdocs, providing an invaluable training opportunity. They will assist in model curation, running simulations, and data analysis, thereby training the next generation of data-savvy scientists as mandated by the research call. (Estimated cost: $40,000/year/student = $120,000).
*   **Principal Investigator (PI) Effort:** The PIs from the collaborating institutions will contribute their time without salary support from this grant, as is customary for their institutions.

**2. Computational Resources ($120,000):**
The reconstruction of thousands of GEMs and the simulation of complex community models are computationally intensive tasks that require access to high-performance computing (HPC).
*   **Cloud Computing Credits / HPC Access:** We request $40,000 per year for either the purchase of time on a national HPC cluster or for credits on a commercial cloud platform (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud). This will provide the necessary computational power for parallelized model reconstruction, large-scale FBA simulations, and data storage.

**3. Travel and Collaboration ($75,000):**
Facilitating strong collaboration within the geographically distributed working group is paramount.
*   **Working Group Meetings:** We budget for annual in-person meetings of the entire working group (PIs, postdocs, students). These intensive, two-day workshops are critical for brainstorming, troubleshooting, and planning the next phases of the project. ($15,000/year = $45,000).
*   **Conference Travel:** We request funds for the postdocs and students to present their findings at one major international conference per year (e.g., ISMB, Microbiome Keystone Symposia). This is essential for disseminating our results and receiving feedback from the broader scientific community. ($5,000/year/trainee = $30,000).

**4. Publication Costs ($15,000):**
In accordance with our commitment to open science, we will publish our findings in open-access journals. We budget for anticipated article processing charges (APCs) for 3-4 major publications. ($5,000/publication).

**5. Indirect Costs (F&A) ($175,000):**
Indirect costs are calculated at a negotiated rate of 21.5% of the total direct costs ($810,000). This support is critical for the institutional infrastructure that makes this research possible.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:** This project is uniquely suited for NCEMS support. The synthesis of multi-kingdom omics data, the reconstruction of thousands of metabolic models, and the integration into a predictive framework requires a level of computational infrastructure and collaborative, interdisciplinary expertise that is not available in a single lab or through existing collaborations. The project's focus on an emergent biological phenomenon and its commitment to open, reproducible science and trainee development align perfectly with the core mission of the funding organization.",,
ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_05,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,"The Evolutionary Assembly of Molecular Machines: A Phylogenetic Synthesis of Structure, Interaction, and Genomic Data","The cell is powered by intricate molecular machines—protein complexes like the ribosome, proteasome, and spliceosome—whose complexity arose over billions of years of evolution. How these multi-subunit assemblies emerged from simpler ancestral components is a fundamental, unanswered question in biology. This working group will address this by tracing the evolutionary trajectories of protein complex assembly through a massive synthesis of public data. Our team of evolutionary biologists, structural biologists, and bioinformaticians will integrate data from phylogenomics, structural biology (PDB), and protein-protein interaction databases (IntAct, BioGRID, CORUM) across the tree of life. Our approach is three-pronged: 1) We will use deep homology searches and phylogenetic profiling across thousands of genomes to determine the evolutionary age of every subunit in major eukaryotic protein complexes. 2) We will map this phylogenetic information onto experimentally determined interaction networks and 3D structures to reconstruct the step-wise addition of subunits over evolutionary time. 3) We will use ancestral sequence reconstruction and structural modeling to infer the properties of ancient sub-complexes. This will allow us to ask how the emergence of new subunits enabled novel functions and regulatory capacities. We aim to uncover general principles of molecular evolution, such as the role of gene duplication in sub-functionalization, the existence of conserved 'assembly kernels' around which complexes are built, and how interaction networks are rewired to create evolutionary novelty. This project will produce a 4D atlas of the evolution of cellular machinery, providing unprecedented insight into the emergence of biological complexity from simple ancestral parts.",,"Background And Significance

The functionality of a eukaryotic cell is defined by the coordinated action of thousands of molecular machines—large, stable protein complexes that execute core processes such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein degradation. These machines, including the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome, are marvels of molecular engineering, often composed of dozens of unique protein and RNA subunits. A central, unresolved question in biology is how this staggering complexity emerged from simpler ancestral components over billions of years of evolution. Answering this question is key to understanding the origins of cellular organization and the principles that govern biological innovation.

The current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data but a deficit of integration. Over the past two decades, genomics has provided the complete protein-coding repertoires for thousands of species across the tree of life. Concurrently, structural biology, supercharged by the cryo-EM revolution, has delivered near-atomic resolution snapshots of these machines in various functional states. Finally, high-throughput proteomics has mapped the intricate web of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that form the basis of these complexes. Seminal studies have leveraged these data types in isolation or in limited combination to study the evolution of individual complexes. For instance, analyses of the ribosome have revealed its ancient RNA core, with proteins being added in successive layers, suggesting an accretionary model of evolution (e.g., Petrov et al., 2015). Similarly, work on the nuclear pore complex has traced its origins to a simpler membrane-coating machinery (Field & D'Souza, 2020). Ancestral sequence reconstruction has been powerfully applied to single proteins to trace their functional evolution (Thornton, 2013), but its application to entire complexes remains nascent.

Despite these advances, significant gaps in our knowledge persist, primarily due to data fragmentation and the lack of a unified analytical framework. Genomic, structural, and interactomic data reside in disparate public databases (e.g., NCBI, PDB, BioGRID) and are rarely synthesized on a large scale. Consequently, our understanding of complex evolution is piecemeal, based on bespoke studies of a few well-characterized systems. We lack general principles that describe how molecular machines evolve. Are there common assembly pathways? What is the role of gene duplication versus de novo gene birth in creating new subunits? How are interaction networks rewired to accommodate new components without disrupting core function? Answering these questions requires a systematic, integrative approach that is beyond the scope of any single research laboratory. Most studies are limited in their phylogenetic breadth or in the number of complexes they analyze, preventing the discovery of universal patterns.

This research is both important and timely. It is important because it addresses a fundamental question about the emergence of biological complexity, with profound implications for synthetic biology, where researchers aim to build novel molecular machines, and for medicine, as misassembly of complexes underlies numerous diseases. The project is timely because we have reached a critical inflection point in data availability and computational power. The exponential growth of public databases, coupled with advances in deep homology detection, phylogenetic methods, and AI-driven structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold2), makes a large-scale synthesis project not only possible but imperative. This working group, by bringing together experts in phylogenomics, structural biology, and network science, is uniquely positioned to bridge the existing knowledge gaps. By synthesizing public data to create a '4D atlas' of molecular machine evolution, we will provide an unprecedented view into the historical processes that built the modern cell.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this working group is to uncover the general principles governing the evolutionary assembly of multi-subunit protein complexes. We will achieve this by systematically reconstructing the evolutionary history of dozens of core eukaryotic molecular machines. Our research is structured around three central questions, each associated with specific, testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: What are the relative evolutionary ages of the constituent subunits of major eukaryotic molecular machines, and do they follow a predictable spatial and topological pattern?**
This question addresses the fundamental chronology of assembly. We seek to determine when each component of a machine first appeared in evolutionary history.
*   **Hypothesis 1a (The 'Assembly Kernel' Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that most protein complexes are built around an ancient, structurally and functionally central core of subunits that was established early in eukaryotic evolution (i.e., present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, LECA). Younger, more lineage-specific subunits were subsequently added to the periphery of this 'assembly kernel'.
*   **Prediction:** A quantitative analysis will show a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between the evolutionary age of a subunit and its centrality within the complex. We predict that older subunits will have greater buried surface area, more interaction partners (higher degree centrality), and be more critical for connecting different parts of the complex (higher betweenness centrality) than younger subunits.
*   **Validation:** We will calculate the evolutionary age of each subunit for ~50 major complexes using phylogenetic profiling across >2000 genomes. We will then compute structural and network centrality metrics for each subunit using data from the PDB and PPI databases. The correlation between age and centrality will be assessed using Spearman's rank correlation, with permutation tests to establish statistical significance. Support for this hypothesis would establish a fundamental principle of layered, accretionary growth.

**Research Question 2: What molecular mechanisms drive the expansion and diversification of protein complexes?**
This question explores the genetic and physical processes that allow simple complexes to grow into more complex ones.
*   **Hypothesis 2a (The 'Duplication-and-Divergence' Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that gene duplication, followed by sub- or neo-functionalization of the resulting paralogs, is the dominant mechanism for increasing the subunit complexity of molecular machines.
*   **Prediction:** We will find that a significant fraction of subunits within a given complex are paralogs. Furthermore, we predict that recently duplicated paralogs will occupy structurally adjacent positions and share some interaction partners, reflecting their common ancestry. Over longer evolutionary timescales, they will have diverged to occupy distinct positions and engage unique partners.
*   **Validation:** We will systematically identify all paralogous subunits within our set of complexes using sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis. We will map these paralog pairs onto the complex's structure and interaction network. We will test whether the structural and interaction-network distance between paralogs is inversely correlated with their divergence time. We will use ancestral sequence reconstruction to infer the interaction interfaces of the ancestral protein and model how they diverged in the descendants.

**Research Question 3: How did the incorporation of new subunits enable novel biological functions and regulatory capabilities?**
This question links the evolution of structure to the evolution of function.
*   **Hypothesis 3a (The 'Regulatory Periphery' Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that the ancient 'assembly kernel' typically performs the core catalytic or structural function of the machine, while younger, peripheral subunits are primarily responsible for regulation, linking the complex to other cellular pathways, and refining substrate specificity.
*   **Prediction:** A functional enrichment analysis will show that Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to 'catalytic activity' or 'structural molecule activity' are significantly enriched among the oldest stratum of subunits. In contrast, terms like 'regulation of X', 'protein binding', or terms specific to a particular lineage's biology will be enriched among the younger strata of subunits.
*   **Validation:** We will assign each subunit to an evolutionary age stratum (e.g., 'LECA origin', 'Opisthokont origin'). We will then perform a GO term enrichment analysis for each stratum within each complex. Statistical significance will be determined using a hypergeometric test with correction for multiple testing. Furthermore, we will use ancestral sequence reconstruction and structural modeling to build models of ancestral sub-complexes (e.g., the LECA proteasome) and analyze their functional potential, comparing it to the modern, fully-assembled machine.

**Expected Deliverables:** Our work will produce a comprehensive database of subunit evolutionary ages, reconstructed assembly pathways for dozens of complexes, and a public web portal for visualizing these '4D' evolutionary trajectories.

Methods And Approach

This project will synthesize vast, publicly available datasets using a novel, integrated computational pipeline. Our multidisciplinary working group is structured into three synergistic teams—Phylogenomics, Structural & Network Biology, and Ancestral Reconstruction—to execute the project aims. The entire workflow is computational and does not involve new data generation.

**Data Sources and Curation:**
Our research is founded on the integration of four major types of public data:
1.  **Genomic Data:** We will assemble a comprehensive and taxonomically balanced set of over 2,000 complete eukaryotic proteomes from NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl, and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), representing all major eukaryotic supergroups. This forms the basis for our evolutionary analysis.
2.  **Protein Complex Definitions:** We will use the CORUM database (Comprehensive Resource of Mammalian protein complexes) as a high-quality, manually curated starting point to define the subunit composition of our target molecular machines. This list will be supplemented with data from species-specific databases and literature.
3.  **Structural Data:** We will retrieve all available experimentally determined structures of the target complexes and their sub-assemblies from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For components lacking experimental structures, we will utilize high-confidence predicted models from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.
4.  **Interaction Data:** We will aggregate a high-confidence physical interaction network for each complex from major PPI databases, including BioGRID, IntAct, and STRING. Interactions will be filtered to include only those supported by multiple lines of evidence or those directly observed in structural data.

**Aim 1: Determining Subunit Evolutionary Age:**
This aim will be led by our Phylogenomics team. For each subunit of a target complex (e.g., human RPT1 in the proteasome), we will perform a deep homology search using its protein sequence as a query in an iterative HMM-HMM-based search (HHblits) against our custom database of 2,000+ proteomes. The resulting hits will be used to define protein families and infer orthologous groups using OrthoFinder, a method robust to gene duplication events. This process generates a presence/absence matrix for every subunit across our species tree. We will then use established methods for ancestral state reconstruction (both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, implemented in R packages like `ape` and `phytools`) to map the origin of each subunit to a specific node on a calibrated eukaryotic species tree (e.g., from TimeTree.org). This assigns each subunit to an evolutionary stratum (e.g., LECA, Opisthokonta, Metazoa), providing its relative evolutionary age.

**Aim 2: Reconstructing Evolutionary Assembly Trajectories:**
This aim, led by the Structural & Network Biology team, integrates the age data from Aim 1 with structural and interaction data. First, we will construct a composite, structurally-resolved interaction graph for each complex, where nodes are subunits and edges represent physical interactions. We will then color the nodes according to their evolutionary age. To test the 'Assembly Kernel' hypothesis (H1a), we will calculate various centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness) for each node and structural properties (buried surface area, number of distinct interfaces). We will then use Spearman's rank correlation to test for a significant association between age and these metrics. To test the 'Duplication-and-Divergence' hypothesis (H2a), we will identify all paralogous pairs within each complex using phylogenetic analysis of the gene families from Aim 1. We will then calculate the structural distance and interaction-partner overlap (Jaccard index) for each pair and test for a negative correlation with their divergence time.

**Aim 3: Inferring Ancestral Sub-complex Properties:**
The Ancestral Reconstruction team will lead this aim. To test the 'Regulatory Periphery' hypothesis (H3a), we will first perform a systematic Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis on the subunits within each evolutionary stratum for every complex. We will use a hypergeometric test with FDR correction to identify functions that are significantly associated with ancient versus more recently evolved components. To gain deeper structural insight, we will perform ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) for key ancient subunits. Using the gene families from Aim 1, we will build multiple sequence alignments and gene trees, and then use a maximum likelihood framework (e.g., PAML) to infer the ancestral protein sequences at key nodes (e.g., the LECA node). These inferred ancestral sequences will then be used as input for AlphaFold-Multimer to generate structural models of ancient sub-complexes. We will analyze these models for structural integrity, conservation of catalytic sites, and comparison of interaction interfaces with their modern counterparts.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Data aggregation, curation, and pipeline development. Execution of Aim 1: complete phylogenetic profiling and age determination for all subunits in ~50 core complexes. Milestone: A comprehensive database of subunit evolutionary ages.
*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Execution of Aims 2 and 3: network analysis, ancestral reconstructions, and structural modeling. Interpretation of results, development of the '4D Atlas' web visualization tool, and preparation of manuscripts. Milestone: Submission of the primary manuscript and launch of the public web portal.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology by providing a fundamentally new, evolutionary dimension to our understanding of the cell's essential machinery. The expected outcomes will have a lasting impact on the field, with broad applications in basic science, biotechnology, and education.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary outcome of this research will be the elucidation of general principles that govern the evolution of molecular complexity. By moving beyond single-complex studies to a large-scale, systematic synthesis, we expect to answer long-standing questions: Is complex assembly primarily an accretionary process built on ancient cores? What is the relative importance of gene duplication versus other mechanisms in generating novelty? How are function and regulation layered onto molecular machines over time? The discovery of such 'rules' of molecular evolution would represent a major conceptual advance, providing a predictive framework for understanding any multi-component biological system.

A second major outcome will be the creation of a rich, publicly accessible data resource: the '4D Atlas of Molecular Machines'. This integrated database and interactive web portal will be the first of its kind, allowing researchers to visualize the evolutionary assembly of complexes through time. Users will be able to select a complex and see its subunits appear on a timeline, mapped onto its 3D structure and interaction network. This will not only be a powerful tool for hypothesis generation for the entire research community but will also serve as an invaluable educational resource for teaching the dynamic, evolutionary nature of the cell.

Finally, we will develop and disseminate a robust, scalable, and transferable computational workflow for evolutionary data synthesis. This pipeline—integrating phylogenomics, structural analysis, and network biology—can be readily adapted by other researchers to study the evolution of other systems, such as metabolic pathways, signaling networks, or even ecological networks, thus amplifying the project's impact.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The insights gained from this work have significant potential for broader applications. In **synthetic biology**, understanding the natural design principles of stable, functional molecular machines can guide the de novo engineering of novel protein assemblies. For example, knowledge of how nature uses conserved 'kernel' subunits as scaffolds could inform the design of custom enzymatic pathways or targeted drug delivery vehicles. In **biomedicine**, our work will provide an evolutionary framework for understanding diseases of complex misassembly ('complexopathies'), which include many cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. By identifying the most ancient, conserved, and structurally critical interfaces, we can better predict which mutations are likely to be pathogenic and potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

This project is also intrinsically designed for **training and education**. It will provide a unique cross-disciplinary training environment for two postdoctoral fellows and a graduate student, equipping them with highly sought-after skills in computational biology, data science, and evolutionary analysis. They will be the vanguard of a new generation of scientists fluent in data synthesis. We will further broaden our educational impact by developing teaching modules based on our '4D Atlas' and by hosting a summer workshop in Year 2 to train the wider community in our methods.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
Our commitment to open science is central to this project. All source code for our analysis pipelines will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. All generated data, including subunit ages and ancestral sequences, will be deposited in Zenodo and made accessible through our web portal. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals (e.g., *eLife*, *PLOS Biology*) and present our work at key international conferences (e.g., SMBE, ASCB, ISMB) to ensure rapid and broad dissemination of our results and methods. The long-term vision is to establish this working group as a hub for evolutionary systems biology, expanding our framework to prokaryotic systems and fostering a collaborative community dedicated to understanding the origins of biological complexity.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research requires a synergistic, multidisciplinary effort and computational resources that exceed the capacity of a single laboratory, making it an ideal project for the NCEMS working group model. The budget is designed to support the personnel, computational infrastructure, and collaborative activities essential for the project's success over a two-year period. All research is purely computational, leveraging publicly available data in alignment with the research call.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:**
This project is a community-scale synthesis effort at its core. It requires the tight integration of three distinct scientific disciplines: evolutionary genomics, structural biology, and network science. No single PI's lab possesses the full spectrum of expertise needed to collect, process, and synthesize these disparate data types. The project's scale—analyzing thousands of proteins across thousands of genomes—necessitates a collaborative team and significant computational resources that are not typically available through standard single-investigator grants. The NCEMS framework is crucial for providing the dedicated support for postdoctoral fellows who can be co-mentored across disciplines and for funding the in-person meetings that are vital for fostering the deep intellectual integration required to solve this complex problem.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_06,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,Mapping the Waddington Landscape: A Dynamical Systems Model of Cell Fate Decisions from Single-Cell Multi-Omic Data Synthesis,"Cellular differentiation, the process by which stem cells give rise to specialized cell types, is a classic example of emergence, where complex, stable phenotypes arise from underlying gene regulatory networks. Conrad Waddington's 'epigenetic landscape' metaphorically captures this process, but a quantitative, predictive model remains elusive. This working group will construct data-driven Waddington landscapes by synthesizing the explosion of public single-cell multi-omic data. Our team of developmental biologists, systems biologists, physicists, and machine learning experts will collate and integrate time-course single-cell datasets (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scNMT-seq) from major cell atlas initiatives (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, Fly Cell Atlas) covering key developmental and reprogramming systems. By applying novel computational methods derived from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics, we will move beyond simple trajectory inference. Our goal is to reconstruct the high-dimensional state space of the underlying gene regulatory network and the vector field that governs cell state transitions. This will allow us to: 1) Quantitatively map the landscape of cell fate decisions, identifying stable attractor states (cell types), saddle points (decision points), and the barriers between them. 2) Identify the key transcription factors and regulatory loops that shape the landscape's topology. 3) Model how stochastic gene expression at the single-cell level interacts with the deterministic landscape to produce robust yet plastic cell fate outcomes. This project will provide a powerful, generalizable framework for understanding how cellular identity emerges and is maintained, with profound implications for regenerative medicine, cancer biology, and our fundamental understanding of development.",,"Background And Significance

The concept of cellular identity emerging from the complex interplay of genes has been elegantly captured for over 60 years by Conrad Waddington's 'epigenetic landscape' metaphor. In this model, a pluripotent cell, represented as a ball at the top of a hill, rolls down a branching system of valleys, with each path leading to a distinct, stable cell fate at the bottom. This intuitive picture powerfully illustrates the robustness and directionality of development. However, despite its conceptual influence, the Waddington landscape has remained largely a qualitative metaphor. A central challenge in modern biology is to transform this metaphor into a quantitative, predictive, and data-driven mathematical framework. The recent explosion in single-cell genomics has provided the technological means to address this challenge. Technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) allow us to capture high-dimensional snapshots of the molecular state of thousands of individual cells as they undergo differentiation. This has led to the development of numerous computational methods for 'trajectory inference' (TI), such as Monocle, Slingshot, and PAGA. These tools order cells along a 'pseudotime' axis, revealing branching lineage pathways and identifying genes that change along these paths. While transformative, these TI methods are fundamentally descriptive. They reconstruct the paths cells have taken but do not model the underlying forces, or dynamics, that govern these transitions. They cannot, for instance, quantify the stability of a cell state, predict the outcome of a genetic perturbation, or explain why certain cell fate transitions are more probable than others. A new frontier of methods has begun to address these limitations by inferring cellular dynamics. RNA velocity, for example, leverages the ratio of spliced to unspliced mRNA transcripts to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of gene expression, providing a vector for each cell that points towards its likely future state. Tools like scVelo and dynamo have extended this concept to reconstruct a continuous vector field that represents the flow of cells through gene expression space. These approaches represent a critical step towards a dynamical systems view of development. However, significant gaps remain. First, most current methods do not explicitly reconstruct the potential landscape itself, which is essential for quantifying concepts like cell state stability (the depth of a valley) and transition barriers (the height of a ridge). Second, integrating multi-omic data—such as combining the fast timescale of transcription (scRNA-seq) with the slower timescale of epigenetic modifications (scATAC-seq)—into a single, coherent dynamical model is still in its infancy. Epigenetic changes are thought to shape the landscape itself, but current models rarely incorporate this explicitly. Third, the role of stochasticity is often treated as technical noise, yet biological evidence suggests that random fluctuations in gene expression are a crucial ingredient in development, allowing cells to explore different states and cross landscape barriers. This project is timely and important because it stands at the confluence of three enabling factors: the massive and growing repository of public single-cell multi-omic data from community efforts like the Human Cell Atlas; the increasing maturity of machine learning and dynamical systems theory to model complex, high-dimensional systems; and the pressing need in fields like regenerative medicine and cancer biology for predictive models of cell fate control. By synthesizing public data through the lens of statistical physics and dynamical systems, this working group will address a long-standing fundamental question in biology. We will move beyond mere description to build a predictive framework that can quantitatively map the Waddington landscape, identify its key molecular sculptors, and model the interplay of deterministic forces and stochastic fluctuations that drive cellular emergence.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group aims to transform the Waddington landscape from a qualitative metaphor into a quantitative, predictive framework by synthesizing public single-cell multi-omic data. Our research is structured around three central questions, each with specific, testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can the high-dimensional state space and governing vector field of cellular differentiation be reconstructed from time-series single-cell data to quantitatively define the Waddington landscape's topology?**
This question addresses the core challenge of building the landscape itself. We move beyond simple trajectory plotting to model the underlying forces governing cell state transitions.
*   **Hypothesis 1a (H1a):** The dynamics of cellular differentiation can be approximated as a gradient system, where the vector field of gene expression changes is the negative gradient of a potential function, U(x), representing the Waddington landscape. Stable, terminal cell types correspond to local minima (attractors) of this potential function.
    *   **Prediction:** Our reconstructed potential landscape for well-characterized systems like hematopoiesis will exhibit distinct basins of attraction. The coordinates of these minima in gene expression space will correspond to the transcriptomic profiles of known mature cell types (e.g., erythrocytes, neutrophils). The depth of these basins, a measure of their stability, will correlate with the known robustness of these cell fates.
    *   **Validation:** We will quantitatively compare the locations of predicted attractors with cell type annotations from the original studies. Using cross-validation, we will train our model on early and intermediate time points and test its ability to predict the distribution of cell types at the final time point.
*   **Hypothesis 1b (H1b):** Cell fate decision points correspond to unstable saddle points on the potential landscape, and the ridges separating basins of attraction represent the energetic barriers to cell fate transitions.
    *   **Prediction:** The model will identify saddle points along differentiation trajectories that co-localize with multipotent progenitor cells known to be at lineage commitment points (e.g., common myeloid progenitors). The calculated potential energy difference between a progenitor state and a transition state (saddle point) will quantify the barrier that must be overcome for differentiation to proceed.
    *   **Validation:** We will compare the locations of predicted saddle points and the genes that define them with the known biology of lineage priming and commitment from the literature.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the core components of the gene regulatory network (GRN) and the key epigenetic modifications that sculpt the topology of the Waddington landscape?**
This question seeks to identify the molecular machinery that creates the valleys and ridges of the landscape.
*   **Hypothesis 2a (H2a):** The landscape's geometry is primarily shaped by a core set of master transcription factors (TFs) whose interactions (e.g., mutual repression, auto-activation) create the stable attractors and bifurcations of the dynamical system.
    *   **Prediction:** In silico perturbation of these identified TFs within our model will cause dramatic and predictable changes to the landscape topology. For example, knocking out a lineage-specific TF like GATA1 in a hematopoietic model will lead to the flattening or disappearance of the erythroid attractor basin.
    *   **Validation:** We will identify candidate driver TFs using feature importance methods on our trained model. These predictions will be validated against extensive existing literature and, where available, public single-cell CRISPR perturbation datasets (e.g., Perturb-seq).
*   **Hypothesis 2b (H2b):** Chromatin accessibility acts as a slower-timescale variable that modulates the faster transcriptional dynamics, effectively changing the shape of the landscape over developmental time.
    *   **Prediction:** An integrated multi-omic model will show that the parameters of the transcriptional vector field are dependent on the chromatin state. For instance, the influence of a TF on its targets will be stronger when the chromatin at those target sites is accessible. Barriers on the landscape will correlate with regions of inaccessible chromatin.
    *   **Validation:** We will build and compare the predictive accuracy of models trained with and without epigenetic data. We will analyze the learned dependencies to explicitly test if chromatin accessibility at TF binding sites is a strong predictor of that TF's regulatory influence in the model.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How does stochastic gene expression interact with the deterministic landscape to influence cell fate probabilities and timing?**
This question addresses the role of noise in development, treating it not as an error but as a functional component of the system.
*   **Hypothesis 3a (H3a):** Cell-to-cell variability can be modeled as a diffusion process on the reconstructed potential landscape. The probability of a cell adopting a particular fate is determined by the interplay between the deterministic pull of the landscape's valleys and the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations.
    *   **Prediction:** Stochastic simulations (using a Langevin equation) on our learned landscape will reproduce the experimentally observed proportions of different cell lineages emerging from a common progenitor pool. The model will also predict the distribution of transition times for cells to reach their final state.
    *   **Validation:** We will compare the distributions of cell populations generated by our simulations against held-out experimental data from later time points using rigorous statistical metrics (e.g., Earth Mover's Distance).

Methods And Approach

Our project is a purely computational synthesis effort, organized into three synergistic phases executed by our interdisciplinary working group. We will leverage agile project management principles, with continuous collaboration via a dedicated Slack channel and a shared GitHub repository, complemented by quarterly in-person or virtual workshops.

**Phase 1: Community Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase addresses the significant challenge of integrating heterogeneous public datasets.
*   **Data Sources and Selection:** We will exclusively use publicly available data from repositories like the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), EMBL-EBI, and major consortia portals including the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), Mouse Cell Atlas, and Fly Cell Atlas. We will prioritize datasets that meet stringent criteria: (1) provide a time-course or developmental trajectory; (2) are multi-omic, ideally with paired transcriptomic and epigenomic readouts from the same cell (e.g., scNMT-seq, 10x Multiome); (3) originate from well-characterized biological systems to provide a 'ground truth' for model validation.
*   **Initial Biological Systems:** We will focus on three canonical systems to develop and test our framework:
    1.  **Murine Hematopoiesis:** The quintessential model of hierarchical differentiation, with a wealth of time-resolved scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.
    2.  **Human Pancreas Development:** A clinically relevant system for understanding organogenesis and diabetes, with high-quality datasets from the HCA.
    3.  **Cellular Reprogramming (e.g., Fibroblast to iPSC):** A controlled, engineered system that allows us to study how cells traverse a non-physiological landscape to acquire pluripotency.
*   **Standardized Processing Pipeline:** We will develop and implement a reproducible data harmonization pipeline using the `Scanpy` and `Seurat` ecosystems. This pipeline will handle raw data processing, quality control, normalization, and batch effect correction across different studies and technologies using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Harmony, scVI). The output will be a set of unified, analysis-ready data objects, a key deliverable in itself.

**Phase 2: Dynamical Model and Landscape Reconstruction (Months 7-18)**
This phase constitutes the core intellectual contribution of our project.
*   **Vector Field Learning:** Our central goal is to learn a continuous vector field function, **F**(x), that maps a cell's high-dimensional state `x` (its gene expression profile) to its velocity vector `dx/dt`. We will first initialize this process by computing RNA velocity using `scVelo`'s dynamical model where applicable. We will then train a deep learning model, specifically a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), to learn the global function **F**(x) from the discrete snapshot data. This approach allows us to infer a continuous trajectory for any cell state, not just those observed experimentally.
*   **Multi-Omic Integration:** To incorporate epigenetic data, we will develop a conditional Neural ODE. Here, the chromatin accessibility vector (from scATAC-seq) will serve as a condition that modulates the weights of the neural network defining the transcriptional dynamics. This formally models the hypothesis that the epigenetic state shapes the rules of gene regulation.
*   **Potential Landscape Derivation:** Assuming the system's dynamics are dominated by gradient-like forces, we will decompose the learned vector field **F** into its gradient and curl components using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. The gradient component can then be numerically integrated to yield a scalar potential function U(x), our quantitative Waddington landscape. The minima, saddle points, and barriers of U(x) will be identified using standard methods from computational topology.
*   **GRN Driver Identification:** The trained Neural ODE is not a black box. We will interrogate it to find key regulatory drivers. We will compute the Jacobian matrix of the vector field (∂**F**/∂x), which represents the local GRN interactions. Furthermore, we will use saliency maps and integrated gradients to rank genes based on their influence on the vector field at critical regions, such as bifurcation points.

**Phase 3: Stochastic Simulation and In Silico Perturbation (Months 19-30)**
In this phase, we will use our model for prediction and hypothesis testing.
*   **Stochastic Modeling:** We will extend our deterministic model (dx/dt = **F**(x)) to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form dx = **F**(x)dt + σ(x)dW. The diffusion term σ(x), representing biological noise, will be estimated from the local variance of gene expression in the data. This SDE model fully embraces the probabilistic nature of cell fate decisions.
*   **Forward Simulation and Validation:** We will perform forward simulations by numerically solving the SDE, starting with populations of cells from early experimental time points. We will then compare the distributions of simulated cells at later time points with held-out empirical data. A close match in cell type proportions and transcriptomic distributions, as measured by metrics like the Wasserstein distance, will validate our model's predictive power.
*   **In Silico Experiments:** A key outcome is the ability to perform experiments computationally. To simulate a gene knockout, we will modify the learned function **F**(x) to remove that gene's regulatory contributions and re-run the SDE simulations. This will allow us to predict how specific perturbations re-sculpt the landscape and alter cell fate outcomes, providing testable hypotheses for future experimental work.

**Timeline and Open Science:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data harmonization for all three systems. Release v1.0 of the vector field reconstruction pipeline. Submit first methods-focused publication.
*   **Year 2:** Complete multi-omic integration and stochastic modeling framework. Perform in silico perturbations and validation for the hematopoietic system. Release v1.0 of the open-source software package.
*   **Year 3:** Complete cross-system comparative analysis. Host a community training workshop. Submit major biological application papers. All code, models, and processed data will be made publicly available through GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will yield significant advances in our fundamental understanding of cellular biology and provide powerful new tools for the scientific community, with far-reaching impacts in medicine and biotechnology. Our expected outcomes are organized around intellectual merit, practical applications, and community building.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
*   **A Quantitative Framework for Emergence:** Our primary contribution will be the development of a robust, generalizable computational framework to transform Waddington's qualitative landscape into a quantitative, predictive model. This moves the field beyond descriptive analysis of single-cell data towards a mechanistic understanding of how stable cell fates emerge from underlying molecular interactions. This directly addresses the research call's focus on fundamental questions of emergence in cellular biosciences.
*   **Novel Biological Insights into Cell Fate Control:** By applying this framework to canonical systems like hematopoiesis and pancreas development, we will generate specific, novel biological hypotheses. We expect to identify previously unappreciated regulatory drivers at key decision points, quantify the relative stability of progenitor versus terminally differentiated states, and elucidate the precise role of chromatin remodeling in canalizing cell fate decisions. For example, our analysis of the non-gradient (curl) component of the dynamics may reveal regulatory motifs, like oscillatory feedback loops, that are critical for maintaining pluripotency.
*   **A New Paradigm for Data Synthesis:** This project will serve as a powerful exemplar of synthesis research. By integrating dozens of disparate, publicly funded datasets, we will generate a holistic view of developmental processes that would be impossible to achieve from any single study. This demonstrates the immense scientific value that can be unlocked from existing data archives and provides a blueprint for future community-scale synthesis projects.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Regenerative Medicine:** The ability to rationally design cell differentiation protocols is a holy grail of regenerative medicine. Our predictive framework will provide a platform for in silico screening of perturbation strategies. Instead of costly and slow trial-and-error in the lab, researchers could use our model to identify the optimal combination and timing of growth factors or transcription factor expression to guide stem cells to a desired therapeutic fate (e.g., insulin-producing beta cells) with high efficiency and purity.
*   **New Perspectives in Cancer Biology:** Cancer can be conceptualized as a disease of a distorted epigenetic landscape, where malignant cells are trapped in abnormal, proliferative attractor states. Our methods can be applied to cancer datasets to map these aberrant landscapes, identify the oncogenic drivers that create them, and computationally screen for drug combinations that could destabilize the cancer state and push cells towards differentiation or apoptosis.
*   **Training a New Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This inherently interdisciplinary project is an ideal training environment. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be co-mentored by experts in developmental biology, physics, and machine learning, gaining deep expertise that spans these fields. They will lead collaborative sub-projects, manage open-source code development, and present at international meetings. We will host a final, hands-on workshop to train the broader community in the use of our tools, directly fulfilling the call's mandate to train the future data-savvy workforce.

**Dissemination Plan and Long-Term Vision:**
*   **Open Science and Reproducibility:** Our commitment to open science is absolute. We will disseminate our work through:
    1.  **High-Impact Publications:** Targeting journals like *Nature Methods* for the framework and *Cell* or *Science* for the biological discoveries.
    2.  **Open-Source Software:** A well-documented and user-friendly Python package, `DynamoScape`, will be released with tutorials and example datasets.
    3.  **Data and Model Portal:** A project website will provide interactive visualizations of the reconstructed landscapes and access to all processed data and trained models.
*   **Long-Term Vision:** This project lays the groundwork for a 'Dynamical Cell Atlas'—a community resource that moves beyond cataloging cell types to mapping the rules that govern their transitions. In the future, this framework can be extended to incorporate spatial genomics to understand how tissue architecture constrains the landscape, and to comparative genomics to study how developmental landscapes evolve across species. This working group will catalyze a long-term collaborative community focused on a dynamical systems approach to biology.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the capabilities of any single research lab and requires the unique collaborative structure and support provided by the NCEMS. The need for NCEMS support is justified by three core requirements: (1) **Diverse and Integrated Expertise:** Our project's success hinges on the deep integration of knowledge from developmental biology, systems biology, statistical physics, and machine learning. A working group model is essential to foster the sustained, cross-disciplinary dialogue needed to solve this problem. (2) **Dedicated Data Synthesis Effort:** The curation, harmonization, and integration of dozens of massive public datasets is a significant undertaking requiring dedicated personnel with protected time, a task ill-suited for traditional grant mechanisms.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_07,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,The Allosteric Interactome: Uncovering the Hidden Regulatory Network of the Cell through Co-evolutionary and Structural Data Synthesis,"Allostery—the process by which a binding event at one site on a protein affects a distant functional site—is a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation. While individual examples are well-studied, a systems-level map of the cell's 'allosteric interactome' is missing, hindering our ability to understand cellular signaling and discover new drug targets. This working group proposes to create this map by synthesizing diverse, large-scale public data. Our transdisciplinary team of structural biologists, computational biophysicists, and network biologists will integrate three key data types: 1) Protein sequence data for thousands of protein families to perform statistical coupling analysis (SCA), which identifies co-evolving residues that often form allosteric pathways. 2) Protein structure data from the PDB to build residue-residue interaction networks and analyze their dynamic properties. 3) Functional data from databases of mutations and enzyme kinetics (e.g., ClinVar, BRENDA) to validate predicted allosteric effects. By combining these data streams within a machine learning framework, we will develop a computational engine to predict, on a proteome-wide scale, the allosteric communication pathways within proteins and the specific residues that act as allosteric 'hubs'. This will allow us to address how emergent regulatory function arises from the physical architecture of proteins. The project will deliver a publicly accessible, searchable database of predicted allosteric sites and pathways across the human proteome. This resource will not only reveal thousands of previously unknown regulatory mechanisms but will also provide a blueprint for designing novel allosteric drugs that offer greater specificity and fewer side effects than traditional active-site inhibitors, opening a new frontier in pharmacology.",,"Background And Significance

Allostery, the phenomenon where a perturbation at one site of a protein propagates to a functionally distinct, distant site, is a cornerstone of biological regulation. First conceptualized by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux in the 1960s to explain the cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, it has since been recognized as a ubiquitous mechanism controlling nearly every cellular process, from metabolic feedback inhibition to complex signal transduction cascades. This 'action at a distance' allows proteins to act as sophisticated information processors, integrating multiple signals to produce finely tuned functional outputs. The current state of the field is characterized by a deep but narrow understanding. Decades of research have yielded exquisitely detailed case studies of allostery in specific proteins, such as GPCRs, kinases, and transcription factors. These studies, employing techniques like X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, have revealed that allosteric communication is mediated by subtle, collective changes in protein structure and dynamics. Computationally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided atomistic views of these conformational transitions, while network-based models, representing proteins as graphs of interacting residues, have helped rationalize the pathways of communication. A pivotal advance came from the field of molecular evolution. The work of Ranganathan and colleagues on Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) demonstrated that residues forming allosteric pathways often co-evolve. This insight established a powerful principle: evolutionary history, captured in multiple sequence alignments, contains a record of the structural and functional constraints that shape allosteric mechanisms. Despite these advances, a profound gap in our knowledge remains: we lack a systems-level, proteome-wide map of allosteric regulation. Our understanding is a collection of isolated examples, not a comprehensive atlas. Experimental methods for identifying allosteric sites are low-throughput, costly, and often technically challenging, making a proteome-scale survey infeasible. Existing computational methods are typically applied on a one-off basis, require expert supervision, or rely on a single data type, limiting their predictive power and scalability. For instance, methods based solely on structure may miss dynamic effects, while those based on sequence alone lack physical grounding. This fragmentation prevents us from addressing fundamental questions about the emergent properties of cellular regulation. How are allosteric pathways architected across entire protein families? Are there universal 'design principles' for allosteric communication? How does the network of allosteric interactions within and between proteins give rise to robust cellular behavior? This research is critically important and timely because we are at a unique confluence of data availability and computational power. The explosion of public data—including massive sequence databases (UniProt), comprehensive structural repositories (PDB, AlphaFold DB), and extensive catalogs of human genetic variation (ClinVar, gnomAD)—provides the raw material for an unprecedented data synthesis effort. Concurrently, advances in machine learning, particularly graph-based neural networks, provide the ideal tools to integrate these heterogeneous data types and learn the complex patterns that define allosteric communication. Creating a map of the 'allosteric interactome' will not only transform our basic understanding of cellular signaling but also have profound translational impact. Allosteric drugs, which target regulatory sites rather than conserved active sites, promise greater specificity and novel modes of action. A comprehensive atlas of allosteric sites would provide a treasure map for the discovery of next-generation therapeutics, addressing the urgent need for new strategies to combat drug resistance and off-target effects.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this working group is to construct and validate the first proteome-wide map of the human allosteric interactome. By synthesizing co-evolutionary, structural, and functional genomics data, we aim to move beyond single-protein case studies to a systems-level understanding of allosteric regulation. This endeavor is guided by three central research questions and their corresponding testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: Can the synergistic integration of co-evolutionary signals, structural dynamics, and functional mutation data systematically and accurately predict allosteric pathways within proteins on a proteome-wide scale?**
Our central premise is that a multi-modal approach will capture a more complete picture of allostery than any single data type alone. Co-evolutionary data reveal functional constraints over geological timescales, structural network data provide the physical scaffold for communication, and functional data ground the predictions in physiological outcomes.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A machine learning model trained on integrated features from Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA), protein structure networks (PSNs), and known functional mutation data will significantly outperform models based on any single data type in predicting experimentally validated allosteric sites and pathways.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that our integrated model will achieve a substantially higher Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) on a curated benchmark set of known allosteric proteins (e.g., from the AlloSteric Database) compared to baseline models using only SCA, PSN metrics, or sequence conservation. We will rigorously test this using k-fold cross-validation and by evaluating performance on an independent hold-out test set of proteins not used during training or model selection.

**Research Question 2: Do proteins within shared functional pathways or structural families exhibit common allosteric architectural principles or conserved 'design motifs'?**
If allostery is a product of evolution, we expect to find convergent solutions and conserved regulatory architectures among related proteins. Identifying these principles is key to understanding the emergence of complex regulatory networks.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Allosteric 'hub' residues—those predicted to be critical for propagating signals—are not randomly distributed but are enriched in specific structural motifs (e.g., at domain interfaces, in hinge regions) and are frequently targets of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that serve as regulatory switches.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that a network analysis of our predicted allosteric interactome will reveal clusters of proteins with similar allosteric network topologies, and that these clusters will significantly correlate with Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations and KEGG pathway memberships. We will validate this by performing statistical enrichment analyses, testing for significant co-localization of predicted allosteric hubs with known PTM sites (from PhosphoSitePlus) and domain boundaries (from Pfam), using permutation testing to establish statistical significance.

**Research Question 3: How does disease-associated genetic variation perturb the allosteric interactome, and can this knowledge be used to identify novel therapeutic targets?**
A vast number of disease-causing mutations occur far from a protein's active site, and their mechanism of action is often unknown. We propose that many of these act by disrupting allosteric communication.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** A significant fraction of pathogenic missense mutations cataloged in databases like ClinVar, particularly those distal to active sites, exert their deleterious effect by disrupting critical nodes or edges within allosteric communication pathways.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that our predicted allosteric pathways will be statistically enriched for known pathogenic mutations from ClinVar compared to presumed benign polymorphisms from gnomAD, even after controlling for confounding factors like residue conservation and solvent accessibility. To validate this, we will develop an 'allosteric disruption score' for every possible missense mutation in the human proteome. We will then test whether this score is a more accurate classifier of pathogenicity than established tools (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen-2), especially for the challenging class of non-active-site variants.

**Expected Deliverables:** The successful completion of this research will yield: (1) A robust, open-source computational pipeline for proteome-scale prediction of allosteric regulation. (2) The 'Human Allosteric Interactome Atlas,' a publicly accessible, searchable web database for the scientific community. (3) A comprehensive map linking thousands of disease mutations to specific disruptions in allosteric signaling, providing novel mechanistic insights. (4) A series of high-impact, open-access publications detailing our methods, findings, and the community resource.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a transdisciplinary working group with expertise in computational biophysics (PI 1), bioinformatics and network biology (PI 2), and machine learning (PI 3). The research plan is organized into three synergistic aims, with specific roles for postdoctoral and graduate trainees to foster their development in a collaborative, data-intensive environment, directly aligning with the research call's training goals.

**Aim 1: Curation of Integrated Datasets and Gold-Standard Benchmarks.**
The foundation of our synthesis project is the rigorous acquisition and harmonization of diverse public datasets.
*   **Sequence Data:** We will compile multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for ~18,000 human protein families from the Pfam database. For families with insufficient sequence diversity, we will generate de novo MSAs using HHblits to search the UniRef100 database. Quality control will be stringent, filtering MSAs based on depth and coverage to ensure robust co-evolutionary signal.
*   **Structural Data:** We will utilize all available experimental structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For the many proteins lacking experimental structures, we will leverage the high-quality, comprehensive models from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. All structures will undergo a standardized preprocessing pipeline: cleaning, protonation state assignment using PDB2PQR, and energy minimization using the OpenMM toolkit to relax any strained conformations.
*   **Functional and Validation Data:** A 'gold-standard' training set will be meticulously curated from the AlloSteric Database (ASD), which catalogs proteins with experimentally validated allosteric sites and modulators. This will form our ground truth for supervised machine learning. For large-scale statistical validation, we will integrate: (1) pathogenic missense variants from ClinVar; (2) presumed benign population variants from gnomAD; (3) post-translational modification sites from PhosphoSitePlus; and (4) enzyme kinetic data from BRENDA.

**Aim 2: Development of an Integrated Computational Pipeline for Allostery Prediction.**
This aim constitutes the core data synthesis effort, combining three analytical modules into a unified predictive framework.
*   **Module 1: Co-evolutionary Network Inference:** We will implement a high-throughput Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) pipeline. For each protein family's MSA, we will compute a matrix of co-evolutionary scores between all pairs of residues. This identifies 'sectors' of co-evolving residues that often correspond to functional units and allosteric pathways.
*   **Module 2: Structural Network and Dynamics Analysis:** For each protein structure, we will construct a residue-residue interaction network, or Protein Structure Network (PSN). Residues are nodes, and edges are weighted by the strength of inter-residue non-covalent interactions calculated using a distance-based cutoff. We will compute a suite of network centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality) for each residue to identify its importance in the physical communication network. To capture dynamic properties, we will perform Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) on an elastic network model of the protein to identify low-frequency collective motions that are often involved in allosteric transitions.
*   **Module 3: Machine Learning Synthesis:** We will develop a machine learning model to integrate the features from Modules 1 and 2. Our primary approach will be a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which is naturally suited to protein structure data. Each residue (node) in the protein graph will be decorated with a rich feature vector, including its sequence conservation, co-evolutionary scores with all other residues, PSN centrality metrics, NMA-derived dynamics, and local structural properties (e.g., secondary structure, solvent accessibility). The GNN will be trained on our gold-standard dataset to learn a function that maps these integrated features to a probability that a given residue is part of an allosteric pathway. We will use 10-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation and employ techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the model and determine the relative importance of evolutionary, structural, and dynamic features.

**Aim 3: Proteome-Wide Prediction, Validation, and Dissemination.**
*   **Prediction:** The validated pipeline from Aim 2 will be deployed on high-performance computing resources to predict allosteric sites and pathways for the entire human proteome for which sufficient data is available.
*   **Statistical Validation:** We will perform large-scale validation by testing for statistical enrichment of predicted allosteric sites in orthogonal datasets not used for training. Specifically, we will use Fisher's exact test to determine if our predicted sites are significantly enriched for: (a) ClinVar pathogenic mutations versus gnomAD variants, (b) known PTM sites, and (c) non-active-site drug binding pockets from DrugBank.
*   **Dissemination:** In adherence with Open Science principles, all code will be shared on GitHub and all data will be deposited in Zenodo. The final, primary deliverable will be the 'Human Allosteric Interactome Atlas,' a public web portal with intuitive search and visualization tools.

**Timeline:**
*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition, preprocessing, and gold-standard dataset curation. Development and benchmarking of standalone SCA and PSN modules. First annual working group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Development and training of the integrated GNN model. Initial proteome-wide application to key families (kinases, GPCRs). Publication of the methodology paper. Second working group meeting.
*   **Year 3:** Completion of proteome-wide predictions. Large-scale statistical validation. Development and public launch of the web database. Dissemination of results at conferences and through a capstone publication.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on medicine and biotechnology. By undertaking the first-ever systematic, proteome-wide synthesis of allosteric regulation data, we will create a foundational resource that shifts the paradigm from studying individual allosteric proteins in isolation to understanding allostery as a system-level, emergent property of the cellular network.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
The primary outcome will be the 'Human Allosteric Interactome Atlas,' a public database and visualization portal. This resource will provide the scientific community with testable hypotheses about the regulation of thousands of proteins, catalyzing new research directions. Our work will provide concrete answers to fundamental questions: What are the conserved architectural principles of allosteric communication? How has allostery evolved across different protein families? How do networks of allosteric interactions contribute to the robustness and adaptability of cellular signaling? By integrating evolutionary history with physical structure, our project directly addresses the research call's focus on understanding how emergent biological function arises from molecular properties.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Revolutionizing Drug Discovery:** The most significant broader impact will be in pharmacology. The Atlas will serve as a blueprint for identifying novel allosteric drug targets across the proteome. Allosteric modulators offer key advantages over traditional active-site inhibitors, including higher specificity (as allosteric sites are less conserved) and the ability to tune protein activity rather than simply blocking it. This opens new therapeutic avenues for diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration and provides a powerful strategy to overcome the growing problem of drug resistance.
2.  **Advancing Precision Medicine:** By systematically linking disease-causing mutations from ClinVar to the disruption of specific allosteric pathways, our project will provide novel mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of genetic disorders. This will enhance the interpretation of genomic data from patients, helping to classify 'variants of unknown significance' and suggesting personalized therapeutic strategies based on restoring or compensating for disrupted allosteric regulation.
3.  **Enabling Protein Engineering and Synthetic Biology:** A deep understanding of allosteric design principles will empower protein engineers to create novel molecular tools. By manipulating the allosteric pathways we identify, researchers can design custom biosensors, molecular switches, and enzymes with precisely controlled activities for applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, and industrial catalysis.

**Dissemination, Open Science, and Training:**
Our commitment to Open Science is central to the project's design and aligns perfectly with the funding call's requirements. All software developed will be open-source and distributed via GitHub. All generated data and the final Atlas will be made publicly available without restriction. We plan for at least three high-impact, open-access publications to ensure broad dissemination of our methods and findings. Furthermore, the project is structured as a training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs will be co-mentored across disciplines, gaining invaluable experience in large-scale data synthesis, machine learning, and collaborative, reproducible science—skills essential for the future data-savvy workforce.

**Potential for Follow-up Research and Long-Term Vision:**
This project will lay the groundwork for numerous future investigations. The working group will be ideally positioned to secure follow-on funding to: (1) Expand the Atlas to other model organisms, enabling comparative and evolutionary studies of allostery. (2) Integrate new data modalities as they become available, such as from cryo-EM and deep mutational scanning experiments. (3) Collaborate with experimental labs to validate high-priority predictions, closing the loop between computation and experiment. Our long-term vision is for the Allosteric Interactome Atlas to become a sustained, dynamic community resource, continually updated and expanded, that serves as an indispensable tool for the molecular and cellular sciences for years to come.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_08,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,Decoding the Emergent Logic of the Splicing Code: A Deep Learning Approach to Integrate Genomic and RBP-Binding Data,"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs vastly expands the functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes and is tightly regulated across different cell types and developmental stages. The 'splicing code'—the set of rules by which cis-regulatory sequences and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) determine splicing outcomes—is extraordinarily complex and context-dependent. This working group will tackle the challenge of deciphering this emergent code through a large-scale synthesis of public functional genomics data. We will assemble a team of RNA biologists, computational geneticists, and machine learning specialists to integrate three massive datasets: 1) RNA-seq data from thousands of samples across diverse tissues and diseases (e.g., GTEx, TCGA, ENCODE) to provide quantitative measurements of splicing events. 2) RBP binding maps from eCLIP-seq experiments (ENCODE) to locate where regulatory proteins bind to RNA. 3) The underlying genomic sequence, which contains the cis-regulatory motifs. Our central strategy is to develop and train advanced deep learning models, such as hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural networks, that can learn the splicing code directly from this integrated data. The models will take genomic sequence and cell-type-specific RBP expression levels as input and predict splicing patterns as output. This will allow us to model how the combinatorial binding of multiple RBPs gives rise to a specific, quantitative splicing decision. We will use these models to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in non-coding regions, identify key RBPs that drive tissue-specific splicing programs, and understand how this regulatory layer is rewired in disease. This project will provide an unprecedented, quantitative understanding of a critical layer of gene regulation and create a powerful tool for interpreting personal genomes.",,"Background And Significance

Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes, enabling a single gene to produce multiple mRNA isoforms and, consequently, a vast diversity of proteins. It is estimated that over 95% of human multi-exon genes undergo AS, playing critical roles in development, cellular differentiation, and physiological homeostasis. The process is orchestrated by the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that recognizes specific sequences at exon-intron boundaries. However, the selection of these splice sites is not fixed; it is dynamically regulated by a complex interplay of cis-acting regulatory sequences within the pre-mRNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). This intricate network of interactions constitutes the 'splicing code,' which dictates splicing outcomes in a manner that is highly specific to cell type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. Dysregulation of this code is a hallmark of numerous human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and congenital defects.

The current understanding of the splicing code is fragmented. Early research identified canonical splice site sequences and key cis-elements, such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs/ISEs) and silencers (ESSs/ISSs). These elements serve as binding platforms for RBPs, primarily from the serine/arginine-rich (SR) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) families, which act as activators or repressors of splicing, respectively. However, these elements are often short, degenerate, and their functional effect is highly context-dependent, making simple motif-based prediction unreliable. The advent of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized the field. Large-scale projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) have used techniques like eCLIP-seq to map the binding sites of hundreds of RBPs across the transcriptome, providing a 'parts list' of the regulatory machinery. Concurrently, projects like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated RNA-sequencing data from tens of thousands of human samples, providing an unprecedented view of splicing variation across diverse tissues and disease states.

Despite this wealth of data, a critical gap in knowledge remains: how do these components integrate to produce a quantitative, predictable splicing outcome? This is a problem of emergence, where the collective behavior of many interacting components (RBPs and cis-elements) gives rise to a complex, higher-level phenomenon (cell-type-specific splicing patterns). Previous computational models have tackled parts of this problem. For instance, models like MaxEntScan predict splice site strength based on local sequence, but they do not account for distal regulatory elements or the trans-acting environment. More recently, deep learning models like SpliceAI have achieved remarkable success in predicting splicing consequences of genetic variants using genomic sequence alone. While powerful, these models are inherently static; they cannot explain why a given exon is included in the brain but excluded in the liver, because they do not explicitly model the changing RBP environment. This project is timely and important because it proposes to bridge this gap. For the first time, the scale of publicly available data is sufficient to train a unified model that integrates genomic sequence (the 'hardware') with the cell-specific RBP expression profile (the 'software'). By synthesizing these massive, orthogonal datasets, our working group will develop a dynamic and predictive model of the splicing code. This will not only address a fundamental question in molecular biology but also create a powerful resource for interpreting the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variation, a major challenge in the post-genomic era.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research proposal is designed to address the emergent complexity of the splicing code through a large-scale data synthesis approach. Our overarching goal is to build and validate a quantitative, predictive model that integrates genomic sequence with the dynamic, cell-type-specific environment of trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to explain and predict alternative splicing outcomes. We have formulated three central research questions, each with a corresponding testable hypothesis, that will guide our investigation.

**Research Question 1: Can a unified deep learning model that integrates cis-regulatory sequence and trans-acting RBP expression data accurately predict quantitative, context-specific splicing outcomes across diverse human tissues?**
*   **Hypothesis 1:** A hybrid deep learning architecture that explicitly models both the genomic sequence context and the cell-type-specific expression levels of RBPs will significantly outperform models that rely on sequence information alone. The combinatorial information provided by the RBP expression profile is essential for predicting the quantitative variation of splicing across different cellular states.
*   **Predictions:** We predict that our integrated model will achieve a substantially higher Pearson correlation and lower mean squared error between predicted and observed Percent Spliced In (PSI) values on a held-out test set of tissues compared to state-of-the-art sequence-only models. Furthermore, we predict the model's performance will be highest for exons known to be regulated by a large number of RBPs.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will train the model on a large subset of the GTEx dataset and evaluate its performance on unseen tissues and cell types. To directly test the hypothesis, we will perform ablation studies where the RBP expression input is removed or shuffled, quantifying the resulting drop in predictive accuracy. This will isolate and measure the contribution of the trans-acting environment to the model's success.

**Research Question 2: What are the specific cis-trans interactions and combinatorial RBP codes that govern tissue-specific splicing programs?**
*   **Hypothesis 2:** Tissue-specific splicing patterns emerge from the synergistic and antagonistic interactions of distinct ensembles of RBPs binding to a 'grammar' of cis-regulatory elements. The functional impact of a given sequence motif is not fixed but is conditional upon the cellular concentration of specific interacting RBPs.
*   **Predictions:** Using model interpretation techniques (e.g., Integrated Gradients, in silico mutagenesis), we will identify sequence motifs whose predicted impact on splicing is significantly altered by changes in the expression levels of specific RBPs or RBP combinations. For example, we predict we will find enhancers that are active only in neuronal tissues due to their dependence on a combination of neuron-specific RBPs like NOVA and ELAVL1.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will systematically perform in silico 'perturbation' experiments, computationally altering the expression level of individual or pairs of RBPs and observing the genome-wide predicted impact on splicing. The resulting network of RBP-RBP functional interactions will be validated against known physical protein-protein interactions from databases like STRING and BioGRID. Furthermore, our model's predictions about key regulatory RBPs for specific tissues will be compared with published experimental results from RBP knockdown or knockout studies.

**Research Question 3: How can a context-aware splicing model improve the interpretation of non-coding genetic variants and elucidate splicing dysregulation in disease?**
*   **Hypothesis 3:** Our model, by accounting for the cellular context, can more accurately predict the pathogenic consequences of non-coding variants and identify the specific RBP dysregulations that drive aberrant splicing in diseases like cancer.
*   **Predictions:** We predict that our model will assign significantly larger predicted splicing changes (ΔPSI) to known pathogenic variants from ClinVar than to common, benign polymorphisms from gnomAD. When applied to TCGA data, we predict the model will identify cancer-specific splicing signatures driven by the altered expression of specific oncogenic or tumor-suppressor RBPs (e.g., SRSF1, PTBP1).
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will benchmark our model's variant-scoring performance against other tools using curated variant datasets and, where available, experimental data from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). For cancer analysis, we will correlate the predicted splicing changes driven by specific RBPs with clinical outcomes, such as patient survival or tumor stage, to identify prognostically significant regulatory rewiring events. These findings will generate specific, testable hypotheses for future experimental validation.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that exclusively utilizes publicly available data, requiring the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary working group. Our approach is organized into three synergistic aims that encompass data integration, model development, and biological interpretation.

**Aim 1: Curation and Integration of a Multi-modal Splicing Dataset.**
The foundation of this project is the construction of a comprehensive, harmonized dataset. This task is beyond the scope of a single lab due to the sheer scale and heterogeneity of the data sources.
*   **Data Sources:** We will leverage three primary data types. 1) **Transcriptomic Data:** We will process raw RNA-seq data from the GTEx project (v8; ~17,000 samples across 54 tissues) and the TCGA project (~11,000 samples across 33 cancer types). 2) **Genomic Sequence:** The human reference genome (GRCh38) will provide the DNA sequence context for each splicing event. 3) **RBP Binding Data:** We will use processed eCLIP-seq peak data for ~150 RBPs from the ENCODE project to inform our model about potential RBP binding sites, although the primary RBP information will come from expression levels.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:** We will establish a reproducible bioinformatics pipeline using workflow managers like Snakemake or Nextflow. For RNA-seq data, reads will be aligned to the genome using STAR. We will then use LeafCutter to identify and quantify intron excision events, yielding Percent Spliced In (PSI) values for thousands of variable splicing events per sample. This event-based approach is robust and well-suited for detecting complex splicing changes. For each sample, we will also quantify the expression (Transcripts Per Million, TPM) of all known RBP-encoding genes.
*   **Data Integration:** The final integrated dataset will be structured for machine learning. Each data point will represent a single splicing event in a single sample and will consist of: (i) the DNA sequence surrounding the event (e.g., 1kb centered on the cassette exon), one-hot encoded; (ii) a vector containing the expression values of ~1,500 known RBPs in that sample; and (iii) the target variable, the quantified PSI value for that event in that sample.

**Aim 2: Development and Training of a Predictive Deep Learning Model.**
Our central goal is to create a model that learns the splicing code from the integrated data.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will develop a hybrid neural network. The first component will be a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes the DNA sequence as input. The convolutional layers are designed to automatically learn and detect relevant cis-regulatory motifs (like ESEs/ESSs) without prior specification. The output of the CNN, a learned embedding of the sequence's regulatory potential, will be concatenated with the RBP expression vector for that sample. This combined feature representation will then be fed into a series of fully connected (dense) layers, which will model the non-linear interactions between the cis-elements and the trans-acting environment to predict the final PSI value. The output layer will use a sigmoid activation function to constrain the prediction between 0 and 1.
*   **Training and Validation:** The model will be implemented in Python using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. We will train the model on a large portion (e.g., 80%) of the GTEx dataset, using the mean squared error between predicted and observed PSI as the loss function. To ensure generalizability and prevent overfitting, we will employ a rigorous cross-validation scheme, holding out entire chromosomes or, more stringently, entire tissues during training and using them for testing. Model hyperparameters will be systematically tuned using techniques like Bayesian optimization. Training will be conducted on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with GPUs.

**Aim 3: Model Interpretation and Application to Disease.**
A key advantage of our approach is the ability to interrogate the trained model to extract biological insights.
*   **Interpretation of Cis-Trans Logic:** We will use feature attribution methods like Integrated Gradients or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand model decisions. These methods will allow us to score the importance of each nucleotide in the input sequence and each RBP in the expression vector for a given splicing prediction. To probe combinatorial control, we will perform large-scale in silico perturbation experiments. By systematically altering RBP expression levels in the input and observing the predicted change in PSI, we can map the functional regulatory network of the splicing code.
*   **Variant and Disease Analysis:** We will apply the trained model to predict the functional impact of genetic variants. By comparing the predicted PSI for a reference allele versus an alternative allele, we can calculate a ΔPSI score to prioritize potentially pathogenic variants from databases like ClinVar. We will also apply the model to the TCGA dataset, using the cancer-specific RBP expression profiles to predict aberrant splicing patterns and identify key RBP drivers of oncogenic splicing programs.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Assemble working group; establish data processing pipelines; complete curation of GTEx and ENCODE data; develop and benchmark initial model prototypes. (Deliverable: Integrated GTEx dataset; prototype model code).
*   **Year 2:** Finalize model architecture; complete large-scale model training and hyperparameter optimization; perform rigorous cross-validation and benchmarking; begin model interpretation and in silico perturbation analyses. (Deliverable: Trained model; initial interpretation results).
*   **Year 3:** Apply the model to TCGA and ClinVar datasets; complete analysis of combinatorial RBP logic and disease-specific splicing; prepare manuscripts for publication; develop and launch a public web portal for model access; disseminate results through conferences and workshops. (Deliverable: Publications; public web portal; final open-source code and data release).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make significant contributions to molecular biology, computational genetics, and precision medicine. By synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets through a novel, multidisciplinary approach, we will generate not only new knowledge but also powerful resources that will catalyze future research across the scientific community.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of the Splicing Code:** The primary outcome will be a state-of-the-art deep learning model, which we will name 'SpliceNet-Context' (SNC). Unlike existing tools, SNC will be the first model to integrate genomic sequence with the trans-acting RBP environment to predict quantitative splicing outcomes across dozens of human tissues and disease states. This model will represent a paradigm shift from static, sequence-based prediction to dynamic, context-aware modeling of a fundamental biological process.
2.  **A Comprehensive Atlas of Splicing Regulation:** Through systematic interpretation of the trained model, we will produce a comprehensive atlas detailing the regulatory logic of the splicing code. This will include: (a) a refined catalog of cis-regulatory motifs and their positional dependencies; (b) a quantitative map of the impact of over 1,500 RBPs on thousands of splicing events; and (c) a network of functional RBP-RBP interactions (synergistic and antagonistic) that define tissue-specific splicing programs. This atlas will provide countless testable hypotheses for the broader RNA biology community.
3.  **An Open-Access Suite of Resources:** In adherence with open science principles, all project outputs will be made publicly available. This includes the fully trained SNC model, all source code hosted on GitHub, all processed data tables deposited in Zenodo, and a user-friendly web portal. The web portal will allow researchers to submit a genomic variant or a gene of interest and receive predictions of splicing patterns across all modeled tissues, democratizing access to our complex model.

**Broader Scientific Impact:**
This research will fundamentally advance our understanding of gene regulation as an emergent phenomenon. By demonstrating how simple components (sequence motifs, individual proteins) interact to produce complex, tissue-specific behavior, our work will provide a blueprint for systems-level analysis of other regulatory processes. It will transform the study of splicing from a gene-by-gene approach to a genome-wide, quantitative science. For the genetics community, SNC will be a powerful tool for interpreting the 98% of disease-associated variants that fall in non-coding regions, helping to bridge the gap between statistical association and biological mechanism. In the context of cancer biology, our analysis of TCGA data will uncover novel mechanisms of splicing dysregulation that contribute to tumorigenesis and may reveal new therapeutic vulnerabilities.

**Dissemination and Training:**
Our dissemination strategy is multifaceted. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals and present at leading international conferences (e.g., ISMB, RNA Society, ASHG). We will also organize a final workshop for the broader community to demonstrate the use of our tools and resources. This project is an exceptional training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs within the working group will receive unique cross-disciplinary training at the interface of wet-lab biology, big data analysis, and machine learning—a skill set in high demand. The collaborative nature of the project will foster a team science environment, preparing trainees for the future of biomedical research.

**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**
The framework we develop is designed to be extensible. The SNC model can be readily updated as more RBP binding data or transcriptomic profiles become available. In the future, it can be expanded to incorporate additional data modalities, such as chromatin structure, DNA methylation, or RNA structure probing data, to build an even more holistic model of gene expression. The collaborative network established by this NCEMS working group will form a durable intellectual hub for data synthesis in RNA biology, positioning us to secure further funding (e.g., NIH R01s) to pursue these exciting future directions and ensure the long-term sustainability and impact of our work.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory. It requires the integration of petabyte-scale datasets, the development of sophisticated machine learning models, and deep domain expertise spanning RNA biology, computational genetics, and computer science. NCEMS support is therefore essential to assemble the necessary multidisciplinary team, fund the required personnel and computational resources, and facilitate the intensive collaboration needed for success. The working group structure is critical for fostering the cross-pollination of ideas that will drive novel insights from these complex, integrated datasets.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_gemini_09,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,gemini-2.5-pro,The Genesis of Eukaryotic Complexity: A Data-Driven Synthesis to Reconstruct the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA),"The origin of the eukaryotic cell, with its nucleus, mitochondria, and complex endomembrane system, represents one of the most profound evolutionary transitions in the history of life. While we know this event involved a symbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium, the cellular and genomic makeup of the resulting organism—the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)—remains enigmatic. This working group will undertake a definitive, data-driven reconstruction of LECA by synthesizing the vast and growing body of public genomic, proteomic, and structural data from across the eukaryotic tree of life. Our team of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and phylogeneticists will leverage data from deeply-sampled eukaryotic lineages, including many understudied protists, which serve as crucial windows into early eukaryotic evolution. The project will involve three synergistic aims: 1) A comprehensive phylogenomic analysis to infer the complete protein-coding gene repertoire of LECA, distinguishing core ancestral functions from later additions. 2) An interaction-based reconstruction, integrating protein-protein interaction and structural data to infer the composition of LECA's ancestral molecular machines and organelles (e.g., the nuclear pore complex, endomembrane trafficking machinery). 3) A functional synthesis, mapping the inferred gene content onto metabolic and regulatory pathways to model the physiology of this ancient cell. By understanding LECA's parts list and how those parts were connected, we can model how hallmark eukaryotic features emerged from the integration of archaeal and bacterial components. This project will produce the most complete and robust model of LECA to date, providing a foundational resource for understanding the principles that govern the emergence of biological complexity.",,"Background And Significance

The emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic ancestors stands as one of the most significant and transformative events in evolutionary history, paving the way for the entire diversity of multicellular life, including fungi, plants, and animals. This transition was characterized by a dramatic increase in cellular complexity, including the acquisition of the mitochondrion, the evolution of a dynamic endomembrane system and cytoskeleton, and the sequestration of the genome within a nucleus. Understanding the nature of the organism that stood at the precipice of this radiation—the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)—is a grand challenge in modern biology. Reconstructing LECA provides a critical anchor point for understanding the fundamental principles of eukaryotic cell biology and the evolutionary processes that generate organismal complexity. The current consensus, bolstered by the discovery of the Asgard superphylum of archaea, posits that eukaryotes arose from a symbiosis between an Asgard-like archaeal host and an alphaproteobacterium that became the mitochondrion. This 'two-domain' view of life provides a clear phylogenetic framework for tracing the origins of eukaryotic genes. However, the cellular and genomic state of LECA remains a subject of intense debate. Was LECA a simple 'proto-eukaryote' that only gradually accrued complexity in subsequent lineages, or was it already a highly complex cell, possessing the majority of molecular systems found in modern eukaryotes? Answering this question requires a detailed, data-driven reconstruction of LECA's 'parts list' and cellular organization. Previous efforts to reconstruct LECA have provided invaluable but incomplete insights. Early phylogenomic studies, often based on limited taxon sampling, inferred a core set of several thousand gene families present in LECA. More recent work has focused on reconstructing specific ancestral systems, such as the nuclear pore complex, the endomembrane trafficking machinery (e.g., ESCRTs, COPs), and the spliceosome. These studies have demonstrated the power of comparative genomics but have largely been conducted in isolation, leaving a critical gap in our understanding: the lack of an integrated, systems-level view of the LECA cell. We do not yet have a comprehensive picture of how these individual components were interconnected into functional networks and pathways, nor a complete understanding of the metabolic and physiological capabilities of this ancient organism. Furthermore, many reconstructions have been hampered by a historical reliance on a few model organisms (e.g., yeast, animals, plants), which represent only a tiny fraction of eukaryotic diversity. The vast majority of eukaryotes are microbial protists, and these lineages, many of which branch deep within the eukaryotic tree, are essential for accurately inferring ancestral states. The current moment is uniquely opportune for a definitive synthesis project. The past decade has witnessed an explosion in the availability of publicly accessible genomic and transcriptomic data from an unprecedented diversity of eukaryotic lineages, including crucial, understudied protists from projects like the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) and various single-cell genomics initiatives. Concurrently, advances in computational methods—including more sophisticated phylogenetic models, powerful orthology inference tools, and revolutionary protein structure prediction algorithms like AlphaFold—provide the necessary toolkit to analyze this data deluge. This project will leverage these converging advances to move beyond a simple gene list, aiming to reconstruct LECA as an integrated cellular system. By synthesizing phylogenomics, protein interaction data, and structural biology, we will build a multi-layered model of LECA, providing a foundational resource that will catalyze new research across cell biology, evolutionary biology, and synthetic biology for years to come.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses the overarching question: What was the genomic, structural, and functional composition of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), and how did its hallmark features emerge from the integration of archaeal and bacterial components? To answer this, we have structured our research into three synergistic aims, each with specific questions and testable hypotheses. 

**Aim 1: A comprehensive phylogenomic analysis to infer the complete protein-coding gene repertoire of LECA.**
This aim seeks to generate the definitive 'parts list' of the ancestral eukaryotic cell.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** What was the size and functional composition of the LECA proteome, and what does this imply about its cellular complexity?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** LECA already possessed a highly complex proteome, containing the core components of nearly all major eukaryotic molecular machines, making it qualitatively more similar to modern eukaryotes than to any prokaryote. We hypothesize that the major increase in complexity at the origin of eukaryotes was one of integration and regulation, not simply gene content.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** Our phylogenomic pipeline will infer a core set of approximately 4,000-6,000 protein families that trace back to the LECA node with high statistical support across multiple inference methods (e.g., parsimony, likelihood). Functional annotation of this set will reveal enrichment for hallmark eukaryotic processes like endomembrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and chromatin modification, validating the hypothesis of a complex ancestor.

**Aim 2: An interaction-based reconstruction of LECA's ancestral molecular machines and organelles.**
This aim moves beyond a list of genes to understand how they were organized into functional modules.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** What was the subunit composition and interaction logic of key LECA molecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex (NPC), endomembrane coats (COPII, clathrin), and the proteasome?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** LECA's molecular machines were compositionally sophisticated, containing the core structural scaffolds found across modern eukaryotes, but lacked many of the lineage-specific peripheral and regulatory subunits that were added later. This implies a model of 'core complexity followed by peripheral elaboration'.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** By integrating our inferred LECA proteome with public protein-protein interaction (PPI) and structural data (e.g., AlphaFold DB), we will reconstruct ancestral interaction networks. We predict that these networks will reveal conserved cores for at least ten major complexes, shared across all eukaryotic supergroups. The validity of these reconstructed 'proto-complexes' will be tested by assessing the co-evolutionary signals (e.g., mirrored phylogenetic trees) of their constituent proteins and by comparing their predicted structures to known modern complexes.

**Aim 3: A functional synthesis to model the physiology of LECA.**
This aim integrates the findings from Aims 1 and 2 to create a holistic model of the LECA cell in action.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** What were the core metabolic capabilities and regulatory networks of LECA, and how did they differ from its prokaryotic progenitors?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** LECA was an aerobic, heterotrophic phagotroph, whose metabolism was fully integrated with its proto-mitochondrion. It possessed a sophisticated ubiquitin-based signaling system that was central to regulating protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and membrane trafficking, representing a key eukaryotic innovation.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** Mapping the inferred LECA proteome onto metabolic databases (e.g., KEGG) will reveal complete pathways for oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle, alongside pathways for phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation. We will identify the core components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (E1, E2, E3 enzymes) and their predicted targets, validating the presence of this regulatory network. The resulting genome-scale metabolic model will be tested for its ability to sustain a viable metabolic flux in silico.

**Expected Deliverables:** The primary deliverables will be: (1) A publicly accessible, annotated database of the inferred LECA proteome. (2) Reconstructed interaction networks and 3D structural models for key ancestral molecular machines. (3) A genome-scale metabolic model of LECA. These resources will provide an unparalleled foundation for future research into the principles of eukaryotic cell evolution.

Methods And Approach

This project is a pure data synthesis effort that will integrate publicly available data using a novel, multi-layered computational pipeline. Our transdisciplinary team has the requisite expertise in phylogenomics, cell biology, structural modeling, and network analysis to execute this ambitious plan. The methodology is organized around our three research aims.

**Data Sources and Curation:**
Our foundation will be a meticulously curated dataset of genomes and proteomes. We will compile data from major public repositories including NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl Genomes, and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). A key feature of our approach is the emphasis on deep taxonomic sampling to break long branches and improve phylogenetic accuracy. We will specifically incorporate over 200 diverse protist lineages from sources like the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) and recent single-cell genomic surveys. This eukaryotic dataset of >300 species will be complemented by >1000 representative prokaryotic genomes, with a dense sampling of Asgard archaea and Alphaproteobacteria to serve as critical outgroups for rooting phylogenies. For Aims 2 and 3, we will integrate this genomic data with other data types: protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from STRING and BioGRID (using only high-confidence experimental interactions), protein structures from the PDB and AlphaFold DB, and functional annotations from Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, and InterPro.

**Aim 1: Phylogenomic Reconstruction of the LECA Proteome:**
1.  **Orthology Inference:** We will use OrthoFinder2, a highly accurate and scalable method, to cluster all proteins from our >1300 proteomes into orthologous groups (OGs).
2.  **Phylogenetic Pipeline:** For each of the thousands of OGs, we will build a robust phylogeny. This involves a standardized pipeline: multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT (L-INS-i algorithm), automated alignment trimming with trimAl (gappyout method), and maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference with IQ-TREE2. The latter will use ModelFinder to select the best-fit substitution model and will assess branch support with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates.
3.  **Ancestral State Reconstruction:** To infer the gene content of LECA, we will reconcile these individual gene trees with a consensus species tree. The species tree will be built independently from a concatenated alignment of ~200 conserved, single-copy marker proteins. We will use a suite of ancestral state reconstruction methods, including both parsimony (Dollo and Wagner) and probabilistic likelihood-based models (e.g., using the Count software). An OG will be considered a high-confidence LECA gene only if it is inferred as present by a consensus of these methods.
4.  **Gene Provenance:** For each inferred LECA gene, its comprehensive phylogeny (including prokaryotic homologs) will be analyzed to determine its evolutionary origin: archaeal, bacterial, or a eukaryotic-specific innovation.

**Aim 2: Interaction and Structural Reconstruction:**
1.  **Interactome Inference:** We will map high-confidence PPIs from model organisms (e.g., human, yeast, Arabidopsis) onto our inferred LECA proteins using homology. An ancestral interaction will be inferred if orthologs of the interacting partners are found in LECA and the interaction is conserved across multiple eukaryotic supergroups. This 'phylogenetic profiling' of interactions minimizes false positives.
2.  **Structural Modeling of Complexes:** We will leverage the revolutionary power of AlphaFold-Multimer. For high-priority ancestral complexes (e.g., the core scaffold of the NPC, the ESCRT-III membrane-remodeling machinery), we will use the inferred LECA protein sequences as input to predict the three-dimensional quaternary structure of the entire complex. These structural predictions provide an independent and powerful test of inferred protein interactions.
3.  **Network Analysis:** The resulting LECA interactome will be modeled as a network graph. We will apply community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain modularity optimization) to identify densely interconnected modules, which represent the footprints of ancestral molecular machines and functional pathways.

**Aim 3: Functional and Metabolic Synthesis:**
1.  **Functional Annotation:** The LECA proteome will be functionally annotated using a battery of tools, including eggNOG-mapper for assignment to KEGG Orthology (KO) groups and InterProScan for domain and GO term mapping.
2.  **Metabolic Network Reconstruction:** Using the KO annotations, we will reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of LECA with the KBase platform or the CarveMe tool. This model will mathematically represent all known metabolic reactions catalyzed by the LECA proteome.
3.  **Flux Balance Analysis (FBA):** We will use FBA to simulate LECA's physiology in silico. This will allow us to test hypotheses about its metabolic capabilities, such as its ability to grow on different substrates or its reliance on oxygen for efficient energy production.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition and curation; completion of orthology inference and initial phylogenies; first annual working group meeting. **Milestone:** A version 1.0 inferred LECA proteome.
*   **Year 2:** Refinement of phylogenomic analyses; reconstruction of ancestral interactome and structural models for 5 key complexes; functional annotation and metabolic model construction; training workshop for trainees. **Milestone:** Reconstructed models of the nuclear pore and endomembrane systems.
*   **Year 3:** Integration of all data into a unified cellular model; in silico physiological simulations; manuscript preparation; public release of all data and tools via a dedicated project portal. **Milestone:** Public LECA resource portal and submission of synthesis manuscript.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will provide a transformative, systems-level understanding of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, yielding significant outcomes that will have a lasting impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Definitive, Community-Standard LECA Proteome:** The primary scientific outcome will be the most comprehensive and rigorously validated reconstruction of the LECA gene set to date. This 'LECA parts list,' annotated with functional information and evolutionary origins, will serve as a foundational reference for the entire field. It will replace older, less complete reconstructions and become the standard for any study investigating the deep evolution of eukaryotic gene families.
2.  **The First Structural Models of Ancestral Molecular Machines:** By integrating phylogenetics with AlphaFold-Multimer, we will move beyond lists of components to generate the first plausible 3D structural models of key molecular machines as they existed over a billion years ago. This provides unprecedented mechanistic insight into how these complexes functioned and assembled, revealing the architectural principles of eukaryotic cellular organization.
3.  **An Integrated Systems-Level Model of an Ancestral Cell:** Our final synthesis will be a holistic, multi-scale model of LECA, connecting its genome, proteome, interactome, and metabolome. This will be the most complete model of an ancestral organism ever created, providing a powerful in silico platform for generating and testing new hypotheses about the major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of the nucleus and the integration of the mitochondrion.
4.  **A Novel and Reusable Methodological Framework:** The computational pipeline we develop for integrating phylogenomics, interactomics, and structural biology will be a significant methodological contribution. This open-source workflow will be adaptable for reconstructing other ancestral organisms or systems, providing a valuable resource for the broader evolutionary biology community.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Foundation for Understanding Human Disease:** Core cellular processes like cell division, DNA repair, and intracellular trafficking are deeply conserved from LECA to humans. Malfunctions in this machinery underlie cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders. By understanding the ancestral, core function of these systems, we can gain new perspectives on their roles in human health and disease.
*   **Informing Synthetic Biology:** A detailed blueprint of a complex, viable ancestral cell can provide design principles for the field of synthetic biology. Understanding the minimal set of components required for key eukaryotic functions could guide efforts to engineer synthetic organelles or minimal eukaryotic chassis.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdocs will gain hands-on experience at the cutting edge of computational biology, learning to manage large datasets, implement complex analytical pipelines, and work within a collaborative, multidisciplinary team. We will host an annual workshop to disseminate these skills more broadly.

**Dissemination Plan and Open Science:**
Our commitment to open science is central to this project's philosophy. 
*   **Publications:** We plan for 3-4 major publications in high-impact, open-access journals (e.g., *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, *eLife*, *Cell*), including separate papers for each major aim and a final synthesis paper.
*   **Public Data Portal:** All data, results, and models will be made immediately available through a dedicated project website. This includes the inferred LECA proteome, downloadable network files, PDB files for structural models, and the metabolic model in SBML format. 
*   **Open Source Software:** All analysis scripts and pipelines will be version-controlled on GitHub and released under a permissive open-source license, ensuring full reproducibility and reusability.
*   **Community Engagement:** We will present our findings at major international conferences (e.g., Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, American Society for Cell Biology) and will develop educational materials based on our LECA models for use in undergraduate and graduate curricula.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research is a large-scale computational synthesis project that requires significant personnel effort, computational resources, and collaborative infrastructure. The budget is designed to support a distributed working group of three Principal Investigators (PIs) and their trainees over a three-year period. As this project does not involve any wet-lab experiments, the costs are focused on personnel, computation, and travel to facilitate synergy and collaboration.

**1. Personnel (Total: ~$600,000):**
This is the largest component of the budget, reflecting the person-hours required for data curation, analysis, and integration.
*   **Postdoctoral Scholars (2):** We request full salary and benefits for two postdoctoral scholars for three years.

The collective behavior of this system—immune evasion, angiogenesis, metastasis—is an emergent property of its underlying intercellular communication network. This working group will create a comprehensive atlas of this 'social network' by synthesizing public single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. Our team of cancer immunologists, systems biologists, and computational scientists will integrate data from large-scale initiatives like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and TCGA. Our core methodology will be to systematically infer cell-cell communication events by mapping the expression of ligands in signaling cells to their cognate receptors in receiving cells across millions of individual cells. By applying network theory to this vast communication graph, we will move beyond cataloging pairwise interactions to understanding system-level properties. We will identify: 1) Key communication hubs and keystone cell types that disproportionately control the information flow in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 2) Recurrent communication motifs and feedback loops that stabilize pro-tumorigenic states. 3) How the entire communication network rewires in response to therapies like immunotherapy. This project will produce a dynamic, multi-cancer atlas of TME communication, accessible through an interactive web portal. This resource will allow researchers to understand how collective behaviors emerge from local cell interactions and will provide a rational basis for designing novel combination therapies that disrupt the communication networks that allow tumors to thrive.",,"Background And Significance

The prevailing paradigm in cancer biology has shifted from a cancer-cell-centric model to one that recognizes tumors as complex, adaptive ecosystems. This ecosystem, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME), comprises a heterogeneous collection of cancer cells, immune cells (e.g., T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix components. The coordinated and often co-opted interactions between these cellular players are fundamental drivers of cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The collective behaviors of the tumor, such as sustained angiogenesis, localized immunosuppression, and invasion, are not properties of any single cell type but are emergent phenomena arising from a dense network of intercellular communication. Understanding the 'social network' of the TME is therefore a paramount challenge in modern oncology. 

The advent of high-throughput single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has provided an unprecedented opportunity to deconstruct the TME at cellular resolution. Seminal studies have leveraged these technologies to create detailed cell atlases for various cancers, revealing previously unappreciated cellular heterogeneity and identifying novel cell subtypes. Building on this, a suite of computational tools has been developed to infer cell-cell communication (CCI) by mapping the expression of ligands in signaling cells to their cognate receptors in receiving cells. Tools like CellPhoneDB, NicheNet, and CellChat have enabled researchers to move beyond simple cell-type cataloging to creating static maps of potential interactions. These approaches have successfully identified critical communication axes in specific contexts, such as the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in immune checkpoint blockade or the role of specific CAF-cancer cell interactions in promoting invasion. 

Despite these advances, significant gaps in our knowledge persist, limiting the translational potential of this research. First, most CCI studies are confined to a single cancer type, a limited patient cohort, or a specific biological context. This fragmented approach prevents the identification of generalizable, pan-cancer principles of TME organization. We lack a unified framework to compare and contrast communication networks across different malignancies. Second, current analyses predominantly focus on cataloging pairwise ligand-receptor interactions. While informative, this reductionist view fails to capture the higher-order, systems-level properties of the TME network. The emergent logic of the tumor—how local interactions give rise to global, pro-tumorigenic functions—remains largely uncharacterized. We do not know which cell types act as critical 'hubs' controlling information flow, nor do we understand the recurrent circuit 'motifs' that stabilize the TME's malignant state. Finally, our understanding of TME network dynamics is nascent. How this complex communication web rewires in response to perturbations, particularly cancer therapies, is a critical unanswered question for overcoming treatment resistance. 

This research is both important and timely. The recent explosion of publicly available data from large-scale consortia, including the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), has created a critical mass of data that makes a large-scale synthesis project feasible for the first time. This proposal directly addresses the research call's focus on synthesizing public data to understand emergence phenomena in cellular biosciences. By integrating these vast datasets, our working group will construct the first pan-cancer atlas of TME communication networks. This project will move beyond simple interaction maps to a systems-level analysis, applying principles from network theory to uncover the fundamental organizational logic of the TME. Such an understanding is essential for designing the next generation of cancer therapies, which will likely require rationally designed combination strategies that disrupt the very communication networks that enable tumors to thrive.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research proposal is structured around three primary aims, each designed to deconstruct the TME communication network from a different perspective—from identifying its key players to understanding its recurrent circuits and its dynamic response to therapy. Each aim is driven by specific research questions and testable hypotheses.

**Aim 1: Identify key communication hubs and keystone cell types that disproportionately control information flow in the TME.**
This aim seeks to move beyond a simple census of cell types to a functional understanding of their roles within the TME's information architecture. We will identify the cellular players that are most critical for maintaining network integrity and function.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** Across diverse human cancers, are there conserved cell types or functional cell states that consistently act as central communication hubs?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that specific subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), rather than cancer cells themselves, will consistently emerge as the TME's 'keystone' communicators. These cell types will exhibit high network centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness), acting as critical bridges for signaling between cancer, immune, and stromal compartments, thereby orchestrating a pro-tumorigenic environment.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will construct communication networks for thousands of individual tumor samples. Using network analysis algorithms, we will calculate centrality metrics for every cell type in each sample. We will then test for cell types whose centrality scores are consistently and significantly higher than others across a pan-cancer cohort. We will validate this *in silico* by simulating the removal of these hub nodes and measuring the resulting disruption to network connectivity.
*   **Research Question 1.2:** Is the network centrality of specific cell populations correlated with clinical outcomes, such as patient survival, tumor grade, or metastatic potential?
*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that higher network centrality of immunosuppressive cell types (e.g., M2-like TAMs, regulatory T cells) and lower centrality of effector immune cells (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes) will be significantly associated with poorer overall survival and more advanced disease stage.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate our network metrics with the rich clinical metadata available from sources like TCGA. We will use survival analysis models (e.g., Cox proportional hazards) to test for significant associations between cell-type centrality and patient outcomes, controlling for confounding variables like tumor type and stage.

**Aim 2: Characterize recurrent communication motifs and feedback loops that stabilize pro-tumorigenic states.**
This aim focuses on identifying higher-order circuit patterns, or 'motifs', that represent common functional modules used by tumors to sustain growth and evade the immune system.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** What are the most prevalent multi-cellular communication circuits that are statistically enriched in tumor tissues compared to matched normal adjacent tissues?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize the existence of conserved, pro-tumorigenic motifs. For example, we predict the frequent occurrence of a 'mutual support loop' where cancer cells secrete CSF1 to promote the survival and M2-polarization of macrophages, which in turn secrete growth factors like EGF to stimulate cancer cell proliferation.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will apply motif-finding algorithms to our TME networks to identify over-represented three- and four-node subgraphs. The statistical significance of these motifs will be rigorously assessed by comparing their frequency to that in a large ensemble of randomized networks that preserve basic properties like node degree.

**Aim 3: Determine how the TME communication network rewires in response to therapies, particularly immunotherapy.**
This aim investigates the dynamics of the TME network, seeking to understand how it adapts to therapeutic pressure and why some tumors respond while others are resistant.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** How do the global topology and specific pathway activities of the TME communication network differ between tumors that respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and those that do not?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that in ICI responders, the TME network undergoes a large-scale state transition, rewiring from an immunosuppressive to an inflamed topology. This will be characterized by a marked increase in the strength and diversity of communication pathways originating from CD8+ T cells and helper T cells, and a collapse in the centrality of immunosuppressive populations. Conversely, non-responder networks will exhibit resilience, maintaining their baseline suppressive architecture or reinforcing alternative escape pathways.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will analyze public single-cell datasets from pre- and on-treatment biopsies of patients treated with ICIs. We will perform differential network analysis to identify statistically significant changes in network properties (global metrics, node centrality, and individual edge weights) between responder and non-responder cohorts. This will pinpoint the specific communication pathways associated with successful therapeutic response.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that relies exclusively on the integration and analysis of publicly available data. Our methodology is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and scalable, organized into a three-stage analytical pipeline.

**1. Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonization**
This foundational stage ensures that data from disparate sources are processed into a consistent, analysis-ready format. This task is a primary justification for a collaborative working group, as it requires significant domain expertise and computational resources.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically aggregate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets from major public repositories. Key sources include: 
    *   **Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN):** Provides high-quality, multi-modal data across a wide range of cancers, serving as a core resource.
    *   **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):** While primarily bulk data, we will leverage its unparalleled clinical and genomic metadata for correlation studies and utilize the growing number of associated single-cell datasets.
    *   **Public Repositories (GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress):** We will conduct a comprehensive literature and database search to identify all relevant datasets, with a particular focus on studies with pre- and post-treatment samples for Aim 3.
*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** To overcome technical variability between studies, we will develop and implement a standardized bioinformatic pipeline. This pipeline, containerized using Docker for reproducibility, will perform: 
    1.  **Uniform Raw Data Processing:** Raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) will be processed through a single workflow (e.g., Cell Ranger) to generate gene expression count matrices.
    2.  **Quality Control and Normalization:** Rigorous QC will be applied to filter low-quality cells and genes. Data will be normalized using methods like SCTransform in Seurat to stabilize variance and remove technical artifacts.
    3.  **Batch Correction:** To enable cross-dataset integration, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms like Harmony or Seurat's reference-based integration.
    4.  **Standardized Cell Type Annotation:** We will create a consistent, multi-level cell ontology. Annotation will be performed using a hybrid approach, combining automated reference-based methods (e.g., Azimuth, SingleR) with manual curation based on canonical marker gene expression, ensuring high accuracy across all datasets.

**2. Network Inference and Analysis**
This stage forms the analytical core of the project, transforming processed data into communication networks and interrogating their structure.
*   **Cell-Cell Communication (CCI) Inference:** For each tumor sample, we will infer a weighted, directed network of intercellular communication. To ensure robustness, we will use a consensus approach led by CellChat, a powerful tool that models CCI by considering the stoichiometry of multi-subunit ligand-receptor complexes. We will supplement this with insights from NicheNet, which links communication signals to downstream gene expression changes in the receiving cell. The output will be an adjacency matrix for each sample, where nodes are cell types/subtypes and edges are weighted by the inferred communication probability for specific ligand-receptor pairs.
*   **Network Analysis (Aims 1 & 2):** We will use graph theory libraries (e.g., `igraph`, `NetworkX`) to analyze the inferred networks.
    *   **Hub and Keystone Identification (Aim 1):** We will calculate a suite of centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) for each cell type node across thousands of samples. A composite centrality score will be used to rank cell types and identify those that consistently function as pan-cancer hubs. We will correlate these centrality scores with clinical variables using mixed-effects models to account for study-specific variation.
    *   **Motif Discovery (Aim 2):** We will employ specialized algorithms to search for statistically over-represented network motifs (e.g., feedback and feed-forward loops) of 3 and 4 nodes. The significance of each motif will be determined by comparing its frequency in the real TME networks to its frequency in an ensemble of thousands of degree-preserved randomized networks.
*   **Differential Network Analysis (Aim 3):** To understand network rewiring, we will compare networks across different conditions (e.g., ICI responder vs. non-responder; tumor vs. normal). We will identify statistically significant differences in global network properties (e.g., density, modularity), node-level centrality, and the weights of individual communication pathways (edges). This will pinpoint the specific signaling axes that are gained or lost during therapeutic response.

**3. Timeline and Milestones**
*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12): Pipeline Development and Data Aggregation.**
    *   **Milestones:** Assemble and curate datasets for at least 10 major cancer types. Finalize, benchmark, and publish the open-source data harmonization and network inference pipeline.
    *   **Deliverable:** A containerized, reproducible workflow for generating TME communication networks from raw scRNA-seq data.
*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24): Pan-Cancer Static Network Analysis.**
    *   **Milestones:** Complete the pan-cancer analysis for Aims 1 and 2. Identify conserved network hubs and recurrent communication motifs. Draft and submit the first major manuscript describing the TME communication atlas.
    *   **Deliverable:** A comprehensive, static atlas of TME communication networks and their core organizational principles.
*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36): Dynamic Network Analysis and Public Resource Deployment.**
    *   **Milestones:** Complete the differential network analysis for Aim 3. Develop and deploy the interactive web portal. Submit the second major manuscript on network rewiring. Formulate plans for long-term sustainability of the resource.
    *   **Deliverable:** The public, interactive 'TME Social Network Atlas' web portal, enabling community-wide data exploration.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce a transformative set of resources, insights, and hypotheses that will significantly advance the fields of cancer biology, immunology, and systems medicine. The impact will be felt across basic, translational, and computational research communities.

**Expected Outcomes**
1.  **A Foundational, Pan-Cancer TME Communication Atlas:** The primary tangible outcome will be a comprehensive, multi-cancer atlas of intercellular communication networks. This will be the first resource of its kind, moving beyond single-study analyses to a unified, integrated view of TME organization. This atlas will be made publicly available through an intuitive, interactive web portal, allowing researchers worldwide to explore and visualize communication patterns, query specific ligand-receptor pairs, and compare network structures across different cancer types and cellular contexts.
2.  **Discovery of Fundamental Principles of TME Organization:** By applying network theory to this vast dataset, we expect to uncover novel, generalizable principles of TME self-organization. This includes the identification of 'keystone' cell types that act as master regulators of the TME's functional state (Aim 1) and the characterization of recurrent communication 'motifs' that represent conserved, stabilizing circuits driving pro-tumorigenic behavior (Aim 2). These findings will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how collective tumor properties emerge from local cell interactions.
3.  **Actionable Hypotheses for Novel Combination Therapies:** Our analysis will generate a wealth of specific, data-driven hypotheses for therapeutic intervention. By identifying the critical communication hubs and feedback loops that sustain tumors, we can propose rational strategies to disrupt them. For example, the analysis of network rewiring in response to immunotherapy (Aim 3) will reveal the communication pathways associated with resistance, suggesting novel co-targets to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. These hypotheses will provide a strong foundation for follow-up experimental validation by the broader research community.

**Broader Impact and Alignment with Research Call**
This project is perfectly aligned with the funding organization's mission. It is a community-scale synthesis project that leverages existing public data to address a fundamental question of emergence in molecular and cellular biosciences. The transdisciplinary working group, comprising experts in cancer immunology, systems biology, and computational science, is essential for tackling a problem of this scale and complexity, which is far beyond the capacity of any single research lab.
*   **Advancing Cancer Research:** The atlas will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine, democratizing access to complex systems-level analyses and accelerating the pace of discovery for countless individual research labs.
*   **Informing Precision Medicine:** The network signatures we identify as being associated with clinical outcomes or therapy response could be developed into novel, systems-level biomarkers. A 'network biomarker' that captures the functional state of the TME may prove more predictive and robust than traditional single-gene or protein markers.
*   **Training the Next Generation:** As mandated by the research call, this project provides an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be deeply embedded in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary team, gaining invaluable skills in data science, network biology, and cancer systems biology—a critical skillset for the future biomedical workforce.

**Dissemination and Open Science Plan**
We are fully committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science.
*   **Publications:** We anticipate at least two high-impact, peer-reviewed publications detailing the atlas and our findings on network dynamics.
*   **Open-Access Portal:** The primary mode of dissemination will be the public web portal, ensuring broad and sustained access to the data and visualizations.
*   **Open Code and Data:** All analysis code will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. The computational pipeline will be distributed as a Docker container. All derived data products, such as the network graph files, will be deposited in open repositories like Zenodo with a persistent DOI.
*   **Community Engagement:** We will present our findings at major international conferences (e.g., AACR, SITC, ISCB) and conduct workshops to train researchers in using our portal and analysis tools, fostering a collaborative community around this resource.

ai_generate_ideas_no_role_grok_01,ai,generate_ideas_no_role,grok-4,Emergent Dynamics in Cellular Signaling Networks: Integrating Multi-Omics Data for Predictive Modeling,"This working group proposes a community-scale synthesis project to unravel emergent behaviors in cellular signaling networks by integrating publicly available multi-omics datasets, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics from repositories like GEO, PRIDE, and MetaboLights. Emergence in this context refers to how complex cellular responses arise from interactions among signaling molecules, often leading to unexpected phenotypes in health and disease. The project addresses a fundamental question: How do perturbations in signaling pathways propagate to generate emergent cellular states, such as resistance to drugs or metastatic potential in cancer? By synthesizing data from diverse model organisms and human cell lines, we aim to develop novel analytical strategies, including machine learning-based network inference and dynamic modeling, to predict these emergent properties.

The collaboration involves experts from computational biology, systems biology, biochemistry, and data science across multiple institutions, including those from underrepresented regions and career stages. This transdisciplinary approach is essential, as no single lab possesses the breadth of expertise or computational resources to handle the scale of data integration required. We will leverage NCEMS support for virtual collaboration platforms, data curation workshops, and trainee involvement, fostering skills in open science and reproducible workflows.

Key activities include curating a unified dataset of signaling perturbations, applying graph theory and AI to identify emergent motifs, and validating predictions against independent public datasets. The project will stimulate cross-disciplinary insights, such as linking molecular interactions to cellular decision-making processes. All findings, integrated datasets, and analysis pipelines will be shared via open repositories like GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles. Trainees will participate in hackathons and mentorship programs, training the next generation in data-savvy molecular sciences. This synthesis effort promises to solve long-standing puzzles in signal transduction, such as the origins of cellular heterogeneity, and pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. By tapping diverse talent and promoting inclusive partnerships, the project aligns with the funding organization's mission to advance emergence phenomena through collaborative data synthesis.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular signaling networks are the intricate webs of molecular interactions that govern cellular responses to environmental cues, developmental signals, and pathological stressors. These networks exhibit emergent properties, where the collective behavior of individual components gives rise to complex, often unpredictable outcomes that cannot be deduced from studying isolated parts. Emergence in biological systems, as defined by Anderson (1972) in his seminal work 'More is Different,' highlights how higher-level phenomena arise from lower-level interactions without being directly predictable from them. In the context of molecular and cellular biosciences, emergent dynamics in signaling networks manifest as phenomena like cellular heterogeneity, bistability in decision-making processes, and adaptive responses such as drug resistance in cancer cells.

The current state of the field has been shaped by advances in high-throughput omics technologies, which have generated vast amounts of publicly available data. Transcriptomics datasets from repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) provide gene expression profiles under various perturbations. Proteomics data from PRIDE capture protein abundance and post-translational modifications, while metabolomics from MetaboLights detail metabolic fluxes. These datasets have enabled significant discoveries, such as the mapping of key signaling pathways like MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and NF-κB, which are central to processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).

A detailed literature review reveals foundational work in systems biology that has attempted to model these networks. For instance, Tyson et al. (2003) used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model bistability in cell cycle regulation, demonstrating how feedback loops lead to emergent switch-like behaviors. More recently, machine learning approaches have been applied to infer network topologies from omics data. Sachs et al. (2005) pioneered Bayesian network inference for signaling pathways using phosphoproteomics, revealing causal relationships in immune cells. In cancer research, studies like those by Yosef and Regev (2011) integrated transcriptomics to uncover emergent states in tumor microenvironments, linking signaling perturbations to metastatic potential.

Despite these advances, key gaps persist. First, most studies focus on single-omics layers, failing to capture the multi-scale interactions across transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This siloed approach limits understanding of how perturbations propagate across layers, leading to emergent phenotypes. For example, while transcriptomic changes in drug-resistant cancer cells are well-documented (e.g., Holohan et al., 2013), integrating proteomic and metabolomic data could reveal how post-transcriptional modifications and metabolic rewiring contribute to resistance, a puzzle unsolved due to data integration challenges.

Second, existing models often overlook cross-species comparisons, restricting insights to specific organisms. Data from model organisms like yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) show conserved signaling motifs (e.g., Costanzo et al., 2016), but synthesis with human cell line data is rare, missing opportunities to identify universal emergent principles. Third, analytical strategies are typically lab-specific, lacking the scale for handling petabyte-level data, which requires collaborative expertise in graph theory, AI, and dynamic modeling.

Limitations in current knowledge include the inability to predict emergent states reliably. For instance, in signal transduction, cellular heterogeneity—where identical cells respond differently to the same stimulus—remains a long-standing puzzle (Altschuler and Wu, 2010). This heterogeneity drives phenomena like fractional killing in chemotherapy, where subpopulations survive due to emergent adaptations. Moreover, methodological limitations, such as noise in omics data and incomplete network representations, hinder predictive modeling.

This research is important and timely because it addresses these gaps through community-scale data synthesis, aligning with the NCEMS mission to explore emergence phenomena. With the explosion of public data (e.g., over 100,000 GEO datasets), now is the ideal time for transdisciplinary synthesis. The project's focus on predictive modeling could revolutionize therapeutic strategies, such as designing drugs that target emergent vulnerabilities in cancer. By solving puzzles like the origins of drug resistance and metastasis, it promises broader impacts on personalized medicine and systems pharmacology. Furthermore, in an era of big data, fostering collaborative, open science approaches is crucial for training a data-savvy workforce and tapping diverse talent, ensuring equitable advancement in molecular sciences. This proposal's emphasis on integrating multi-omics data from diverse sources will provide novel insights into how simple molecular interactions yield complex cellular behaviors, filling critical voids in our understanding of life's emergent complexity.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is driven by well-defined research questions that probe the emergent dynamics of cellular signaling networks through the synthesis of publicly available multi-omics data. These questions are designed to be novel, significant, and addressable via collaborative data integration, without generating new experimental data. They focus on how perturbations in signaling pathways lead to unexpected cellular states, leveraging transdisciplinary expertise to develop predictive models.

The primary research question is: How do perturbations in signaling pathways propagate across molecular layers (transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolic) to generate emergent cellular states, such as drug resistance or metastatic potential in cancer? This question targets the core of emergence phenomena, exploring how local interactions yield global behaviors in health and disease.

Sub-question 1: What are the conserved emergent motifs in signaling networks across diverse model organisms and human cell lines? This delves into patterns like feedback loops or bistable switches that recur in datasets from yeast, C. elegans, Drosophila, and human cancer lines, aiming to identify universal principles of emergence.

Sub-question 2: How can machine learning-based network inference and dynamic modeling predict the propagation of perturbations to emergent phenotypes? This focuses on developing analytical strategies to forecast outcomes like cellular heterogeneity or adaptive responses.

Sub-question 3: What role does multi-omics integration play in resolving long-standing puzzles, such as the origins of cellular heterogeneity in signal transduction? This question examines how combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics reveals hidden interactions missed by single-omics approaches.

To address these, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Integration of multi-omics data will reveal conserved emergent motifs, such as positive feedback loops in MAPK pathways, that are predictive of drug resistance across species. Prediction: Network motifs identified in yeast perturbation datasets (e.g., from GEO series GSEXXXX) will correlate with resistance phenotypes in human cancer cell lines (e.g., from PRIDE datasets), with a predictive accuracy >80% when validated against independent data.

Hypothesis 2: Machine learning models trained on synthesized signaling data will accurately simulate emergent states, outperforming traditional ODE-based models in capturing bistability and heterogeneity. Prediction: AI-inferred networks will predict metastatic potential in breast cancer models with higher precision (AUC >0.85) than single-omics models, as tested on holdout datasets from MetaboLights.

Hypothesis 3: Perturbations propagating through metabolic layers will amplify emergent cellular heterogeneity, explaining fractional responses in drug treatments. Prediction: Models incorporating metabolomic fluxes will show increased variance in simulated cellular states compared to transcriptomics-only models, matching observed heterogeneity in public single-cell RNA-seq data.

Expected outcomes include a unified multi-omics dataset of signaling perturbations, novel analytical pipelines for network inference, and predictive models of emergent behaviors. Deliverables encompass: (1) An open-access database of integrated datasets; (2) Peer-reviewed publications on emergent motifs and modeling strategies; (3) Training modules for trainees on data synthesis.

Hypotheses will be tested through a rigorous validation framework. For Hypothesis 1, graph theory will identify motifs in curated datasets, with predictions validated via cross-validation on independent subsets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing). Statistical measures like motif enrichment scores and correlation coefficients will assess significance (p<0.05). For Hypothesis 2, machine learning models (e.g., graph neural networks) will be trained and evaluated using metrics like ROC-AUC and F1-score on withheld data. Dynamic simulations using tools like COPASI will compare predicted vs. observed states. Hypothesis 3 will involve sensitivity analyses to quantify perturbation propagation, with heterogeneity measured by entropy metrics in simulated populations. All tests will incorporate controls, such as randomized network null models, to ensure robustness. Validation against independent public datasets (e.g., from different repositories) will confirm generalizability. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with iterative refinement through working group discussions, ultimately yielding insights into emergence that advance molecular and cellular sciences.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on existing publicly available data, integrating multi-omics datasets to model emergent dynamics in cellular signaling networks. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with the NCEMS emphasis on community-scale synthesis. The approach involves curating, analyzing, and modeling data through a collaborative, transdisciplinary framework.

Detailed data sources include transcriptomics from GEO (e.g., GSE series on perturbation experiments in MAPK and PI3K pathways, covering >500 datasets from yeast, C. elegans, and human cancer lines like MCF-7 and A549). Proteomics data will be sourced from PRIDE (e.g., phosphoproteomics datasets from drug treatment studies, including >200 projects with quantitative mass spectrometry). Metabolomics from MetaboLights (e.g., flux analyses in cancer metabolism, ~100 datasets). Additional resources include STRING for protein interactions, KEGG for pathway maps, and Reactome for signaling annotations. Data selection criteria prioritize high-quality, perturbation-focused sets with metadata on conditions (e.g., drug exposure, genetic knockouts).

Comprehensive analytical methods begin with data curation: We will standardize formats using ontologies like Gene Ontology and MIAME guidelines, handling batch effects via tools like ComBat and normalization with DESeq2 for transcriptomics, MaxQuant for proteomics, and MetaboAnalyst for metabolomics. Integration will employ multi-omics frameworks like MOFA (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis) to reduce dimensionality and identify latent factors linking layers.

Computational approaches include machine learning-based network inference using graph neural networks (GNNs) in PyTorch Geometric to predict interactions from integrated data. Dynamic modeling will use ODEs in COPASI and stochastic simulations in Gillespie algorithms to capture emergence like bistability. Graph theory via NetworkX will identify motifs (e.g., feedforward loops) associated with emergent states. AI techniques, such as random forests and deep learning, will predict phenotypes like drug resistance, with feature importance analyses to highlight key perturbations.

The experimental design is computational, with 'experiments' as in silico simulations. Controls include null models (randomized networks) and negative controls (unperturbed datasets). Replicates are inherent in meta-analysis of multiple datasets; we will use bootstrapping (n=1000) for statistical robustness. Validation involves splitting data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets, with cross-species holdouts (e.g., train on yeast, test on human).

Timeline and milestones span 36 months. Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and unification. Milestone: Release of integrated dataset on Zenodo (Deliverable: Curated database with >1000 synthesized samples). Activities include virtual workshops for team alignment. Year 2 (Months 13-24): Network inference and motif identification. Milestone: Development of AI pipelines and initial models (Deliverable: GitHub repository with code and preliminary results on emergent motifs). Hackathons for trainees to contribute. Year 3 (Months 25-36): Dynamic modeling, prediction validation, and synthesis of insights. Milestone: Final predictive models and validation reports (Deliverable: Manuscripts submitted to journals like Nature Communications).

Statistical analysis plans include differential expression analysis with limma (FDR<0.05), enrichment tests via hypergeometric distribution for motifs, and predictive performance metrics (AUC, precision-recall). Uncertainty will be quantified with Bayesian methods in network inference. Sensitivity analyses will assess model robustness to data noise.

Collaboration is facilitated via NCEMS-supported platforms like Slack, Zoom, and shared computing resources (e.g., cloud-based HPC for large-scale simulations). The team comprises 8-10 members from computational biology (e.g., AI experts), systems biology (modelers), biochemistry (signaling specialists), and data science, spanning institutions in the US, Europe, and underrepresented regions like Latin America. Trainees (4 graduate students, 2 postdocs) will engage in mentorship and hackathons, gaining skills in reproducible workflows (e.g., using Jupyter notebooks and Docker).

This methods framework ensures coherence and rigor, with iterative feedback loops in working group meetings to refine approaches. By leveraging diverse expertise, the project overcomes single-lab limitations, promoting open science through FAIR-compliant sharing of all assets.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will yield significant contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing multi-omics data to uncover emergent dynamics in signaling networks. Intended outcomes include a comprehensive, open-access database integrating >1000 datasets, revealing conserved motifs like feedback loops that drive drug resistance and metastasis. We anticipate novel analytical strategies, such as hybrid AI-ODE models, that predict emergent states with high accuracy (e.g., >80% in cross-validation), solving puzzles like cellular heterogeneity by linking molecular perturbations to phenotypic variability.

Broader impacts extend to therapeutic applications: Predictive models could inform drug design targeting emergent vulnerabilities, potentially reducing cancer relapse rates. In systems pharmacology, insights into perturbation propagation may enable personalized medicine, identifying patient-specific resistance mechanisms from public data. The project's cross-species synthesis will establish universal principles of emergence, applicable to fields like immunology (e.g., immune evasion) and developmental biology (e.g., cell fate decisions).

Potential for follow-up research is substantial. Outcomes could seed experimental validations in wet labs, such as CRISPR perturbations guided by our models. New collaborations may form, extending to other emergence phenomena like microbial community dynamics. We envision scalable frameworks for other signaling networks, fostering long-term NCEMS-supported initiatives.

Dissemination plans include publishing in high-impact journals (e.g., Cell Systems, PLoS Computational Biology) with preprints on bioRxiv. Findings will be presented at conferences like ISMB and Keystone Symposia. All deliverables—datasets, code, workflows—will be shared on GitHub, Zenodo, and a dedicated project website, adhering to FAIR principles. Training materials from hackathons will be openly available, promoting reproducibility.

Publication strategy targets 4-6 papers: One on data integration methods, two on emergent motifs and predictions, one on training impacts, and synthesis reviews. We will engage diverse audiences via webinars and social media.

The long-term vision is a sustainable ecosystem for synthesis research, training a data-savvy workforce equipped for big data challenges. By including underrepresented talent, the project promotes inclusivity, potentially increasing diversity in STEM. Sustainability involves maintaining open resources post-funding, with team members seeking follow-on grants. Ultimately, this work will catalyze a paradigm shift in understanding emergence, from descriptive to predictive biology, with ripple effects on health, biotechnology, and education, aligning with NCEMS goals for innovative, collaborative science.

This project not only advances molecular biosciences by revealing hidden emergent phenomena but also catalyzes new research paradigms in microbial ecology, aligning perfectly with the call's emphasis on novel questions and workforce training.",,"Background And Significance

Microbial consortia represent complex ecosystems where individual microorganisms interact to produce emergent properties that transcend the capabilities of single species. These emergent phenomena, such as enhanced nutrient cycling, antibiotic resistance dissemination, and resilience to environmental perturbations, arise from intricate molecular interactions at the community level. Understanding these properties is crucial for advancing molecular and cellular biosciences, as microbes underpin global biogeochemical cycles, human health, and ecosystem stability. This proposal focuses on synthesizing publicly available metagenomic data to unravel how molecular mechanisms drive the emergence of resilient microbial communities in changing environments, addressing a fundamental question in emergence phenomena.

The current state of the field in microbial ecology has been revolutionized by high-throughput sequencing technologies, leading to an explosion of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic datasets. Repositories like the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) system, MG-RAST, and the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) house vast amounts of publicly available data from diverse habitats, including soils, oceans, and human guts. These datasets capture genetic, transcriptional, and metabolic profiles of microbial communities, offering unprecedented opportunities for synthesis research. For instance, the EMP has sequenced over 200,000 samples, providing a global atlas of microbial diversity. Similarly, IMG/M integrates over 20,000 metagenomes, enabling comparative analyses across ecosystems.

A detailed literature review reveals significant progress in studying microbial interactions. Studies by Hallam et al. (2009) in Nature demonstrated how syntrophic relationships in anaerobic environments facilitate methane production, an emergent function not achievable by isolated species. More recently, Widder et al. (2016) in Nature Reviews Microbiology highlighted network-based approaches to model microbial interactions, showing how keystone species influence community stability. In the human gut, work by Sonnenburg et al. (2016) in Cell illustrated how dietary changes induce emergent shifts in microbiome composition, leading to altered metabolomic profiles. Ocean microbiomes have been explored through the Tara Oceans project (Sunagawa et al., 2015, Science), revealing planktonic interactions driving carbon sequestration. Soil microbiomes, as reviewed by Fierer (2017) in Nature Reviews Microbiology, exhibit emergent resilience to drought via functional redundancy.

Despite these advances, key gaps and limitations persist. First, most studies focus on descriptive analyses of diversity rather than mechanistic insights into emergence. For example, while metagenomics identifies taxa, it often fails to link individual behaviors to community-level functions without integrated multi-omics approaches. Second, data silos hinder synthesis; datasets from different sources vary in formats, annotations, and quality, complicating integration. Third, long-standing puzzles like 'microbial dark matter'—unculturable microbes comprising up to 99% of diversity (Rinke et al., 2013, Nature)—remain unresolved due to insufficient cross-dataset analyses. Syntrophic relationships, where microbes exchange metabolites for mutual benefit, are poorly modeled at scale, limiting predictions of community responses to perturbations like climate change or antibiotic exposure.

These gaps are exacerbated by the scale of data: individual labs lack the computational resources and interdisciplinary expertise to harmonize petabytes of data. Collaborative efforts, such as the Global Microbial Interaction Network (Delmont et al., 2022, mSystems), have begun addressing this, but they often lack a focus on emergence mechanisms. Moreover, methodological limitations in current modeling, such as simplistic network analyses ignoring temporal dynamics, restrict deeper insights.

This research is important and timely for several reasons. Environmentally, understanding emergent resilience in microbial communities is critical amid climate change, where altered habitats threaten nutrient cycling and biodiversity. In health, antibiotic resistance emerges from community interactions, contributing to the global crisis affecting millions (O'Neill, 2016, Review on Antimicrobial Resistance). Agriculturally, soil microbiomes influence crop yields, with emergent functions like nitrogen fixation vital for sustainable farming. Timeliness stems from the recent surge in open data repositories and advances in machine learning, enabling synthesis at unprecedented scales. The NCEMS call emphasizes community-scale synthesis to solve puzzles in molecular biosciences, making this project ideally aligned. By integrating diverse datasets, we can reveal hidden molecular mechanisms, fostering innovative strategies and training a data-savvy workforce. This will not only advance fundamental knowledge but also inform applications in bioremediation, personalized medicine, and ecosystem management, addressing societal challenges through transdisciplinary collaboration.

In summary, the field's progress in data generation contrasts with synthesis limitations, creating an opportune moment for this project. By tackling gaps in emergent phenomena, we aim to provide novel insights that individual studies cannot achieve, ultimately catalyzing paradigm shifts in microbial ecology and molecular sciences.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses the core question: What molecular mechanisms drive the emergence of resilient microbial communities in changing environments? To dissect this, we pose three specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) that leverage synthesis of publicly available metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic data. These questions are designed to be novel, significant, and aligned with the NCEMS call's focus on emergence phenomena in molecular and cellular biosciences.

RQ1: How do molecular interactions at the gene and metabolite levels contribute to emergent community functions like nutrient cycling and antibiotic resistance across diverse habitats? This question targets the synthesis of multi-omics data to identify interaction networks that produce functions beyond individual microbes. For instance, in soil microbiomes, we will examine how gene expression patterns lead to emergent nitrogen fixation.

RQ2: What role does microbial dark matter play in the resilience of consortia under environmental perturbations, such as temperature shifts or pollutant exposure? This addresses the puzzle of unculturable microbes, synthesizing data from perturbed ecosystems to uncover their hidden contributions to community stability.

RQ3: Can predictive models, integrating network analysis and machine learning, forecast emergent behaviors in microbial communities responding to dynamic environments? This methodological question focuses on developing innovative tools for simulating and visualizing interactions, advancing analytical strategies in the field.

For each RQ, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions, grounded in existing literature and designed for validation through data synthesis.

Hypothesis 1 (H1) for RQ1: Syntrophic molecular mechanisms, characterized by reciprocal gene expression and metabolite exchange, drive emergent nutrient cycling in microbial consortia, with keystone genes (e.g., nifH for nitrogen fixation) showing upregulated expression in integrated networks compared to isolated taxa. Prediction: Network analysis of synthesized datasets from soil and ocean habitats will reveal higher connectivity and functional output in consortia with syntrophy, quantifiable by metrics like network modularity (>0.5) and metabolite flux rates (e.g., >10% increase in cycling efficiency).

Hypothesis 2 (H2) for RQ2: Microbial dark matter contributes to community resilience by providing functional redundancy through novel biosynthetic pathways, which become dominant under perturbations. Prediction: In perturbed datasets (e.g., from acid mine drainage or antibiotic-treated guts), dark matter genomes will exhibit enriched annotations for stress-response genes (e.g., >20% prevalence of efflux pumps), correlating with reduced community diversity loss (Shannon index decrease <15%) compared to controls without dark matter integration.

Hypothesis 3 (H3) for RQ3: Agent-based models trained on machine learning algorithms will accurately predict emergent behaviors, such as resistance spread, with >80% accuracy when validated against independent datasets. Prediction: Models incorporating temporal dynamics will outperform static networks, forecasting shifts like antibiotic resistance gene propagation in human gut microbiomes under dietary changes, with root mean square error (RMSE) <0.1 in simulations.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A unified database of harmonized multi-omics data from >500 datasets, publicly accessible via repositories like Zenodo; (2) Novel insights into emergence mechanisms, published in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature Microbiology); (3) Open-source tools for network visualization and predictive modeling, downloadable from GitHub; (4) Training modules for trainees, enhancing skills in data synthesis.

Hypotheses will be tested through a rigorous synthesis pipeline. For validation, we will use cross-validation techniques: 70% of datasets for model training, 30% for testing. Statistical tests (e.g., permutation tests for network significance, p<0.05) will assess predictions. Independent validation will involve applying models to unseen data from sources like the Tara Oceans dataset. If H1 is falsified (e.g., no upregulation), we will refine by incorporating additional metabolomic layers. For H2, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) will be annotated using tools like DRAM, with resilience metrics computed via ecological modeling software (e.g., QIIME2). H3 validation will employ machine learning benchmarks, such as AUC-ROC curves, ensuring robustness.

These questions and hypotheses are feasible within the project's scope, requiring transdisciplinary collaboration to handle data complexity. They promise to solve long-standing puzzles, like the role of dark matter in syntrophy, and develop strategies that advance molecular sciences. By focusing on testable predictions, we ensure scientific rigor, with deliverables including peer-reviewed papers, workshops, and a trained cohort of researchers equipped for future synthesis efforts. This approach not only addresses novel questions but also fosters innovative, reproducible research paradigms. (Word count: 682)

Methods And Approach

This project employs a synthesis-only approach, utilizing exclusively publicly available data without generating new experimental data, in alignment with the NCEMS call. We will integrate metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic datasets from established repositories to model emergent properties in microbial consortia. The methods emphasize collaborative, transdisciplinary strategies, leveraging expertise from microbiologists, ecologists, bioinformaticians, and environmental scientists across three labs: one in North America (focusing on bioinformatics), one in Europe (ecology), and one in Asia (environmental modeling). This setup ensures diverse perspectives and exceeds single-lab capabilities due to data volume (petabytes) and analytical complexity.

Detailed data sources include: (1) IMG/M, providing >20,000 metagenomes with annotated genes and pathways; (2) MG-RAST, offering >500,000 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples with functional profiles; (3) Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), encompassing >200,000 standardized 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomes from global habitats; (4) Additional sources like Tara Oceans (metagenomes from marine environments) and Human Microbiome Project (gut datasets). We will select >500 datasets representing soil (e.g., agricultural fields), ocean (e.g., pelagic zones), and human gut microbiomes, focusing on those with perturbation metadata (e.g., temperature, antibiotics). Data harmonization will address inconsistencies using ontologies like Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for standardization.

Analytical methods and computational approaches are comprehensive and innovative. First, data integration: We will develop a unified framework using Python-based pipelines (e.g., Pandas, Dask for big data handling) to merge datasets. Metagenomic reads will be processed with MetaPhlAn for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN for functional annotation. Metatranscriptomic data will be aligned using HISAT2, quantifying expression with StringTie. Metabolomic profiles will be integrated via MZmine for peak detection and pathway mapping.

Second, network analysis: To model interactions, we will construct co-occurrence networks using SparCC (correlation inference) and dynamic Bayesian networks for temporal dependencies. Emergent properties will be quantified via graph theory metrics (e.g., centrality, modularity) in igraph. For syntrophy, we will identify metabolite exchange motifs using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) in COBRApy, simulating community metabolism.

Third, agent-based simulations: Using NetLogo or custom Julia scripts, we will model individual microbes as agents with rules based on gene expression data, simulating emergent behaviors like resilience. Machine learning (ML) integration will employ scikit-learn and TensorFlow for predictive modeling: Random Forests for feature selection (e.g., key genes), and Neural Networks for forecasting community shifts, trained on 70% data and validated on 30%.

Fourth, visualization tools: We will create interactive dashboards using R Shiny and Cytoscape for exploring networks, enabling users to query emergent patterns.

Although no new experiments are conducted, the 'experimental design' analog involves in silico controls: For each habitat, we will compare perturbed vs. unperturbed subsets (e.g., antibiotic-exposed guts as 'treatment', matched controls). 'Replicates' will be achieved by subsampling datasets (n=100 per category) with bootstrapping for robustness. Sensitivity analyses will test parameter variations (e.g., correlation thresholds).

Timeline and milestones span 36 months: Months 1-6: Team assembly, data curation, and harmonization (Deliverable: Harmonized database on Zenodo). Months 7-12: Network construction and initial analyses (Deliverable: Preliminary models and workshop on open science). Months 13-24: ML modeling, simulations, and hypothesis testing (Deliverable: Predictive tools on GitHub, trainee-led analyses). Months 25-36: Validation, visualization development, and dissemination (Deliverable: Final reports, publications, and training modules).

Statistical analysis plans include: Non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum) for comparing network metrics between conditions (p<0.05, FDR correction). For ML models, performance will be evaluated via cross-validation (k=10 folds), with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE. Ecological indices (e.g., alpha/beta diversity via QIIME2) will assess resilience, with ANOVA for group differences. All workflows will be reproducible using Docker containers and Jupyter notebooks, adhering to open science principles.

NCEMS resources are essential for virtual collaboration platforms, high-performance computing (e.g., cloud storage for data), and workshops. Trainees (3 graduate students, 2 postdocs) will participate in all stages, gaining skills through mentorship and coding sessions. This approach ensures rigor, innovation, and alignment with the call's requirements for transdisciplinary synthesis. (Word count: 872)

Epigenomics has revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation by revealing how chemical modifications to DNA and histones, along with non-coding elements, orchestrate transcriptional programs without altering the underlying genetic sequence. The field traces its roots to pioneering work in the mid-20th century, such as the discovery of DNA methylation by Holliday and Pugh in 1975, which highlighted epigenetic mechanisms as heritable regulators of gene expression. Subsequent advancements, including the identification of histone modifications like acetylation and methylation by Allfrey et al. in 1964, laid the groundwork for understanding chromatin as a dynamic entity. The advent of high-throughput technologies in the 21st century, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), has generated vast datasets that map these epigenetic landscapes across diverse cell types and conditions.

Major consortia have been instrumental in amassing these resources. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, initiated in 2003, has profiled over 1,800 experiments across hundreds of cell lines, providing comprehensive maps of transcription factor binding sites, histone marks, and chromatin accessibility. Similarly, the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, launched in 2008, extended this to 111 reference epigenomes from primary human tissues and cells, emphasizing developmental and disease contexts. The BLUEPRINT project, a European counterpart starting in 2011, focused on hematopoietic cells, generating epigenomic data for over 50 cell types to elucidate blood cell differentiation. These initiatives have democratized access to epigenomic data, enabling researchers to explore gene regulation at unprecedented scales.

Current literature underscores the complexity of epigenetic regulation. Studies by Bernstein et al. (2012) in Nature Reviews Genetics describe bivalent chromatin domains—regions marked by both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histones—that poise genes for rapid activation during differentiation. Work by Filion et al. (2010) in Cell classified chromatin into five principal types based on combinatorial histone modifications, revealing spatial organization principles. Non-coding elements, particularly enhancers, have been a focal point; Levine (2010) in Cell highlighted their role in integrating signals to drive tissue-specific expression. Recent advances incorporate single-cell epigenomics, as in Buenrostro et al. (2015) with scATAC-seq, uncovering heterogeneity in regulatory landscapes.

Despite these strides, significant gaps persist. First, while individual datasets provide snapshots, integrating them across consortia remains challenging due to heterogeneity in experimental protocols, cell types, and data formats. This limits our ability to discern emergent patterns—non-linear, collective behaviors arising from interactions among local epigenetic marks. For instance, how do dispersed enhancers coordinate to produce transcriptional bursting, as observed in single-cell RNA-seq studies by Larsson et al. (2019) in Nature? Current models often treat epigenetic marks in isolation, overlooking synergistic effects that give rise to cellular identity and differentiation. Statistical mechanics approaches, inspired by physics, have been applied sporadically; for example, Bintu et al. (2016) in Science modeled chromatin as a polymer to predict folding, but these are limited to small scales.

Deep learning has shown promise in epigenomics. Libbrecht et al. (2015) used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict chromatin states from sequence data, yet applications to emergent regulation are nascent. Long-standing puzzles include the 'epigenetic code' hypothesis by Strahl and Allis (2001), which posits that combinations of marks encode regulatory information, but predictive models for emergent outcomes are lacking. Limitations in current knowledge stem from siloed expertise: chromatin biologists generate hypotheses, computational modelers handle data, and developmental biologists contextualize findings, but rarely in concert.

This research is timely amid the explosion of public data and computational power. The post-genomic era demands synthesis to extract value from existing resources, aligning with NCEMS's mission to address emergence in molecular biosciences. Understanding epigenetic emergence could transform regenerative medicine by enabling precise control of cellular fates, as in induced pluripotent stem cells (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). It addresses health disparities by including data from diverse populations in BLUEPRINT and Roadmap. By fostering transdisciplinary collaboration, this project taps new talent from emerging hubs, training a data-savvy workforce. The importance lies in solving puzzles like enhancer-promoter looping dynamics, which underpin diseases such as cancer where epigenetic dysregulation is rampant (Flavahan et al., 2017 in Nature). Without synthesis, these datasets remain underutilized, perpetuating fragmented insights. This proposal bridges these gaps, promising broader, deeper understandings of gene regulation's emergent properties. (712 words)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is driven by a central fundamental question: How do local epigenetic marks and non-coding elements interact to produce emergent regulatory logics that govern cellular identity and differentiation? To address this, we delineate specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) that build upon each other, ensuring a logical progression from data integration to model development and validation. These questions are designed to be addressed through synthesis of existing public datasets, leveraging multidisciplinary expertise to uncover novel insights beyond the scope of individual labs.

RQ1: What are the emergent patterns in chromatin modification combinations across diverse cell types and developmental stages? This question focuses on identifying higher-order motifs that arise from the integration of histone marks, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility data. We hypothesize that specific combinations of marks, such as H3K27ac-enriched enhancers coupled with H3K4me1, form 'regulatory hubs' that exhibit non-additive effects, leading to amplified transcriptional responses. Predictions include the discovery of cell-type-specific motifs where enhancer clustering correlates with increased gene expression variability, testable by comparing integrated datasets from ENCODE and Roadmap across embryonic stem cells (ESCs) versus differentiated lineages.

RQ2: How do non-coding elements, particularly enhancers and super-enhancers, contribute to emergent transcriptional dynamics like bursting? Building on RQ1, this explores the role of distal elements in coordinating gene regulation. Our hypothesis posits that enhancer-promoter interactions, modeled as networks, give rise to emergent bursting patterns through cooperative binding, where the probability of bursting increases non-linearly with enhancer density. Expected predictions are that in developmental transitions, such as hematopoiesis in BLUEPRINT data, super-enhancers will show phase-transition-like behaviors, analogous to statistical mechanics models, resulting in sharp switches in cellular identity. Outcomes include quantitative maps of bursting frequencies, validated against single-cell data integrations.

RQ3: Can predictive models based on statistical mechanics and deep learning accurately forecast emergent regulatory outcomes from epigenomic profiles? This synthesizes findings from RQ1 and RQ2 into computational frameworks. We hypothesize that hybrid models combining Ising-like statistical mechanics (for local interactions) with graph neural networks (GNNs) will predict differentiation trajectories with >80% accuracy, outperforming linear models. Predictions involve simulating virtual perturbations, such as 'knocking out' epigenetic marks, to forecast changes in gene expression landscapes. Deliverables include open-source models that generalize across cell types, with benchmarks against held-out datasets.

These hypotheses are testable through data-driven synthesis without new experiments. Validation will involve cross-validation techniques: for RQ1, motif discovery algorithms will be applied to harmonized datasets, with statistical significance assessed via permutation tests (p<0.01). For RQ2, network analyses will use graph theory metrics (e.g., modularity) to quantify emergence, validated by correlating predicted bursting with empirical data from integrated scRNA-seq. RQ3 models will be trained on 70% of data and tested on 30%, using metrics like area under the ROC curve (AUC>0.85) and mean squared error for predictions.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive atlas of emergent epigenetic motifs, predictive software tools, and peer-reviewed publications elucidating regulatory logics. Deliverables encompass: (1) harmonized epigenomic database; (2) motif and network analysis pipelines; (3) hybrid predictive models; and (4) training modules for trainees. These will solve long-standing puzzles, such as the mechanistic basis of transcriptional noise in differentiation (Eldar and Elowitz, 2010), by demonstrating how local marks scale to global behaviors. The approach ensures rigor through reproducibility checks and sensitivity analyses, addressing potential biases in public data (e.g., batch effects). By focusing on emergence, this project advances molecular biosciences, providing frameworks for understanding complex systems in biology. (678 words)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on publicly available epigenomic datasets, integrating them to address emergent gene regulation without generating new data. Primary sources include: (1) ENCODE (Phase 3 and 4), providing ChIP-seq for histone modifications (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K27ac), transcription factors, and RNA-seq across >200 cell types; (2) Roadmap Epigenomics, with DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and methylation arrays for 111 reference epigenomes spanning developmental stages; (3) BLUEPRINT, offering similar data for hematopoietic lineages, including single-cell epigenomics. Supplementary datasets from GEO and SRA will augment coverage, such as scATAC-seq from Buenrostro et al. (2018) for heterogeneity analysis. All data are open-access, ensuring compliance with NCEMS principles.

Analytical methods commence with data harmonization to mitigate heterogeneity. We will use tools like ChromHMM (Ernst and Kellis, 2017) for chromatin state segmentation, integrating marks via hidden Markov models. Batch effects will be corrected using ComBat or Harmony algorithms, ensuring comparable profiles across consortia. For RQ1, emergent motifs will be identified via unsupervised motif discovery with MEME-ChIP and DeepMotif, scanning for combinatorial patterns in enhancers and promoters. Statistical mechanics approaches, inspired by the Ising model, will model interactions: epigenetic marks as spins, with energy functions quantifying cooperative effects (e.g., J_ij for mark i and j interactions). Parameters will be fitted using maximum likelihood estimation on integrated datasets.

For RQ2, we will construct regulatory networks using Hi-C data from ENCODE to infer enhancer-promoter loops, applying graph theory with NetworkX to compute metrics like centrality and clustering coefficients. Emergent dynamics, such as transcriptional bursting, will be simulated using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on Gillespie algorithms, incorporating bursting parameters from Larsson et al. (2019). Deep learning will employ graph neural networks (GNNs) in PyTorch Geometric, where nodes represent genomic loci and edges denote interactions, trained to predict bursting frequencies from epigenomic features.

RQ3 integrates these into hybrid models: statistical mechanics for local rules, fed into deep learning architectures like variational autoencoders (VAEs) for dimensionality reduction and prediction. Models will simulate regulatory emergence by perturbing inputs (e.g., altering methylation levels) and forecasting outcomes like differentiation trajectories, validated against developmental series in Roadmap data.

The experimental design is computational, with 'controls' as baseline linear models (e.g., logistic regression) for comparison. Replicates involve bootstrapping datasets (n=100 iterations) to assess robustness, and sensitivity analyses will test model stability to noise. No physical experiments are involved, but virtual replicates simulate variability.

Timeline spans 36 months: Months 1-6: Team assembly, data curation, and harmonization (Milestone: Integrated database on OSF). Months 7-18: Motif discovery and network construction (Milestone: Emergent motif atlas and initial simulations). Months 19-30: Model development and validation (Milestone: Predictive software release with benchmarks). Months 31-36: Synthesis of findings, trainee-led sub-projects, and dissemination (Milestone: Final reports and publications).

Statistical plans include non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum) for motif enrichment, Pearson correlation for network predictions, and cross-validation for model performance (k=10 folds). Significance thresholds at p<0.05, adjusted for multiple testing via Bonferroni. Power analyses, using simulations, ensure 80% power to detect effect sizes >0.5. All analyses will be conducted on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS) for scalability, with code in R/Python, version-controlled on GitHub for reproducibility.

This approach demands transdisciplinary collaboration: chromatin biologists will interpret biological relevance, computational modelers handle algorithms, and developmental biologists provide differentiation contexts. Trainees will lead sub-projects, such as motif validation, gaining skills in data synthesis. NCEMS resources are essential for computing (handling terabytes of data) and virtual collaboration, enabling inclusive participation from diverse institutions. (852 words)

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks form the backbone of cellular function, orchestrating processes from signal transduction to metabolic regulation. These networks are not static; they exhibit emergent behaviors where collective interactions give rise to properties not predictable from individual components. Emergence in biological systems refers to the appearance of complex patterns and functionalities from simpler rules, a concept rooted in systems biology and complexity science. In molecular and cellular biosciences, understanding emergence is crucial for deciphering how benign molecular interactions can lead to pathological states, such as in neurodegenerative diseases or cancer metastasis.

The current state of the field has advanced significantly with the advent of high-throughput technologies. Public repositories like STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct have amassed vast datasets on PPIs, encompassing millions of interactions across species. STRING, for instance, integrates experimental data, computational predictions, and text-mining to score interactions, while BioGRID curates physical and genetic interactions from literature, and IntAct focuses on molecular interactions with detailed annotations. These resources have enabled network-based analyses, revealing modular structures where proteins cluster into functional units.

Literature review highlights key contributions. Barabási and Oltvai (2004) introduced scale-free network topologies in biology, showing that PPI networks follow power-law degree distributions, making them robust yet vulnerable to hub disruptions. Subsequent studies, such as those by Vidal et al. (2011), mapped human interactomes, identifying disease-associated modules. In neurodegeneration, works like those on Alzheimer's disease (AD) by Zhang et al. (2013) used PPI networks to link amyloid-beta and tau pathologies to network rewiring. For cancer, Hanahan and Weinberg (2011) described hallmarks involving metastatic emergence from altered cell-cell interactions. Protein moonlighting—where proteins perform multiple functions—and allostery, as explored by Nussinov et al. (2013), add layers of complexity, showing how conformational changes propagate through networks.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. First, most studies focus on static snapshots of networks, ignoring dynamic emergent behaviors like tipping points where small perturbations lead to system-wide failures. Percolation theory, applied in physics (e.g., Stauffer and Aharony, 1994), has been underutilized in biology, though preliminary applications by del Sol et al. (2007) suggest it can model network fragility. Second, integration of structural data (e.g., from PDB) with functional annotations (e.g., GO terms) is often siloed, limiting insights into how modular interactions foster emergence. Third, disease mechanisms are typically studied in isolation; synthesis across datasets could reveal universal principles of pathological emergence.

Limitations in current knowledge include the lack of transdisciplinary approaches. Individual labs often handle small-scale analyses, but community-scale synthesis requires diverse expertise: structural biologists for atomic-level insights, network theorists for mathematical modeling, and clinicians for disease relevance. Existing collaborations rarely span geographies or career stages, hindering innovation. Moreover, while AI-driven simulations (e.g., machine learning for network prediction, as in Cho et al., 2016) show promise, they are not systematically applied to emergent phenomena.

This research is important because it addresses fundamental questions in emergence, aligning with the NCEMS call for synthesizing public data to solve puzzles in molecular and cellular sciences. By focusing on how network properties enable pathological phenotypes, it could transform our understanding of diseases like AD, where emergent network disruptions lead to cognitive decline, or cancer, where metastatic spread emerges from local invasions. Timeliness stems from the explosion of public data and computational tools; post-genomic era datasets are ripe for synthesis. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for rapid data integration to model viral-host interactions, highlighting the urgency for similar approaches in chronic diseases.

Furthermore, this work taps diverse talent, training a data-savvy workforce through collaborative efforts. It promotes open science, ensuring reproducibility and broader impact. By revealing hidden mechanisms like moonlighting's role in allostery-driven emergence, it could inform therapeutic strategies, such as targeting network hubs to prevent tipping points. In summary, this proposal bridges gaps by synthesizing disparate data, fostering transdisciplinary collaboration, and advancing cellular biosciences toward predictive models of disease emergence.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses compelling scientific questions in molecular and cellular biology through synthesis of publicly available PPI data, focusing on emergent behaviors that lead to disease states. The overarching question is: What network properties enable the emergence of pathological phenotypes from benign molecular interactions? This is broken down into specific, detailed research questions (RQs) and testable hypotheses, ensuring scientific rigor and alignment with the NCEMS call for novel insights via transdisciplinary synthesis.

RQ1: How do modular structures in PPI networks contribute to emergent pathological behaviors in neurodegenerative diseases? This question explores modularity—clusters of densely connected proteins—and its role in emergence, such as in Alzheimer's disease where tau aggregation disrupts synaptic modules.

Hypothesis 1a: In neurodegenerative PPI networks, high modularity correlates with increased resilience to initial perturbations but leads to rapid collapse beyond a percolation threshold, predicting emergent neuronal loss. Prediction: Networks with modularity coefficients >0.6 (calculated via Louvain algorithm) will exhibit tipping points at 20-30% node removal, compared to <10% in low-modularity controls.

Hypothesis 1b: Integration of structural annotations (e.g., allosteric sites) with PPI data will reveal that moonlighting proteins act as bridges between modules, amplifying emergent disruptions. Prediction: Moonlighting proteins will have higher betweenness centrality (>0.1) and correlate with disease severity scores from clinical datasets.

Expected outcomes: Dynamic models identifying modular tipping points, validated against known AD pathways. Deliverables include a curated dataset of modular networks and predictive algorithms.

RQ2: What role do network dynamics play in the emergence of metastatic phenotypes in cancer? This targets how local interactions scale to systemic invasion, synthesizing PPI data with metastasis-related annotations.

Hypothesis 2a: Application of percolation theory to cancer PPI networks will identify critical thresholds where benign interactions transition to metastatic states, driven by hub protein overexpression. Prediction: Percolation thresholds will be lower (e.g., 15% connectivity loss) in metastatic networks versus primary tumors, testable via simulated node removals.

Hypothesis 2b: AI-driven simulations integrating functional annotations will predict that allosteric changes in key proteins (e.g., integrins) propagate through networks, enabling emergent invasiveness. Prediction: Simulations will show >50% increase in network entropy post-allosteric perturbation, aligning with experimental metastasis rates in public datasets.

Expected outcomes: Predictive models of metastatic emergence, with visualizations of network dynamics. Deliverables: Open-source simulation tools and case studies on breast cancer metastasis.

RQ3: Can transdisciplinary synthesis of PPI, structural, and clinical data uncover universal principles of emergence across diseases? This synthesizes insights from RQ1 and RQ2 to generalize findings.

Hypothesis 3a: Common network properties, such as scale-free topology and high assortativity, underlie emergent pathologies across neurodegeneration and cancer. Prediction: Meta-analysis will show >70% overlap in emergent metrics (e.g., clustering coefficients) between disease networks.

Hypothesis 3b: Collaborative modeling will demonstrate that interventions targeting emergent properties (e.g., stabilizing modules) prevent pathological tipping points. Prediction: In silico perturbations will reduce emergence risk by 40%, validated against clinical outcome data.

Hypotheses will be tested using computational pipelines: Data synthesis from repositories, network construction with tools like Cytoscape, and validation via cross-dataset comparisons. Statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distributions) ensure rigor. Validation involves benchmarking against gold-standard datasets (e.g., OMIM for diseases) and sensitivity analyses.

Expected outcomes include a framework for emergent network analysis, fostering follow-up research. Deliverables: Peer-reviewed publications, open repositories, and training modules for trainees. This approach ensures hypotheses are falsifiable, with clear predictions tied to data-driven metrics, advancing methodological developments in synthesis research. By addressing these RQs, the project solves long-standing puzzles like protein moonlighting's role in allostery, promoting a collaborative, data-savvy workforce. (Word count: 678)

Methods And Approach

This project employs a synthesis-only approach, utilizing exclusively publicly available data without generating new experimental data, in line with NCEMS guidelines. It requires collaboration among structural biologists, network theorists, clinicians, and data scientists from multiple labs across the US, Europe, and Asia, reflecting diverse expertise, geographies, and career stages. NCEMS support is essential for coordinating large-scale data integration and collaborative tools, beyond single-lab capabilities.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include PPI repositories: STRING (v11.5, ~25 million interactions across 14,000 organisms), BioGRID (v4.4, >2 million curated interactions), and IntAct (v2023, detailed molecular interactions with evidence codes). These will be supplemented by structural data from PDB (Protein Data Bank, >200,000 structures) for allosteric and moonlighting annotations, functional data from Gene Ontology (GO) and UniProt for annotations, and disease-specific data from OMIM, COSMIC (for cancer), and Alzforum (for neurodegeneration). Clinical annotations will come from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) for metastasis profiles and ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) for neurodegenerative phenotypes. All data are publicly available, ensuring reproducibility.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: The workflow begins with data curation using automated scripts in Python (e.g., Biopython, Pandas) to harmonize datasets, resolving inconsistencies like protein identifiers via UniProt mapping. Network construction will use igraph and NetworkX libraries to build integrated PPI graphs, incorporating edge weights from interaction scores.

For emergent behavior analysis, we apply percolation theory: Simulate node/edge removals to identify thresholds where network connectivity fragments, using metrics like giant component size and clustering coefficients. AI-driven simulations will employ graph neural networks (GNNs) via PyTorch Geometric to model dynamic changes, predicting allosteric propagations. Machine learning models (e.g., random forests) will classify moonlighting proteins based on features like degree centrality and structural motifs.

Modular analysis involves community detection algorithms (Louvain, Infomap) to identify modules, followed by integration with structural data to assess allostery using tools like AlloSigMA for conformational predictions. For disease focus, subnetworks will be extracted (e.g., AD-related via tau/amyloid interactions) and compared across conditions using differential network analysis.

Experimental Design: Though synthesis-based, the design mimics experimental rigor with 'in silico experiments.' Controls include randomized networks for null models, ensuring observed emergence is not artifactual. Replicates involve bootstrapping (n=1000) for robustness. Validation uses hold-out datasets (e.g., 70/30 split) and cross-validation for AI models.

Timeline and Milestones: The 3-year project is divided into phases.

Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and network construction. Milestone 1 (Month 6): Integrated PPI database released openly. Milestone 2 (Month 12): Preliminary modular analyses completed, with trainee-led workshops.

Quarterly virtual meetings and annual in-person workshops (facilitated by NCEMS) ensure collaboration. Trainees (5 graduate students, 3 postdocs) will lead sub-tasks, gaining skills in reproducible pipelines via Jupyter notebooks and GitHub.

Statistical Analysis Plans: Non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum) for comparing network metrics between disease and control states. Correlation analyses (Spearman) for linking properties like modularity to clinical outcomes. Machine learning performance evaluated via AUC-ROC (>0.85 threshold for acceptance). Multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg) to control FDR <0.05. Sensitivity analyses will assess parameter variations, ensuring logical rigor.

This approach fosters innovative strategies, like hybrid percolation-AI models, addressing scale through distributed computing (e.g., cloud resources via NCEMS). All workflows adhere to open science: Data in Zenodo, code in GitHub, under FAIR principles. This transdisciplinary synthesis will yield deeper insights into emergence, training the future workforce.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will yield transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing public data to uncover emergent mechanisms in PPI networks, directly addressing NCEMS goals. Intended contributions include a comprehensive framework for modeling network emergence, revealing how modular interactions and properties like percolation thresholds drive pathological phenotypes. For instance, we anticipate identifying specific tipping points in neurodegenerative networks, such as a 25% connectivity loss leading to emergent synaptic failure, and in cancer, allosteric-driven entropy increases predicting metastasis. These insights will solve long-standing puzzles, like the role of protein moonlighting in amplifying allostery across modules, providing a unified view of disease emergence.

Broader impacts extend to therapeutic applications: By pinpointing vulnerable network hubs, the work could guide drug design, e.g., stabilizers for AD modules or inhibitors for cancer percolation points. This has societal benefits, potentially reducing the burden of diseases affecting millions (e.g., 50 million with dementia globally). The project promotes equity by assembling diverse teams— including early-career researchers from underrepresented institutions—and geographic spread, fostering inclusive science.

Potential for follow-up research is high. Outcomes will seed new hypotheses, such as extending models to other diseases (e.g., infectious or metabolic). Collaborations may evolve into larger consortia, leveraging NCEMS networks for sustained partnerships. Trainees will emerge as data-savvy leaders, equipped with skills in synthesis and open science, amplifying workforce development.

Dissemination plans emphasize open access: All data, code, and models will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, GitHub) within 6 months of generation, adhering to community policies on reproducibility. Publication strategy includes 4-6 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature Communications, Cell Systems) over 3 years, starting with methods papers in Year 1. Preprints on bioRxiv will ensure rapid sharing. Outreach includes webinars, conference presentations (e.g., ASBMB, ISMB), and training modules—interactive tutorials on network analysis—freely available online, targeting 100+ trainees.

Long-term vision envisions a sustainable ecosystem for synthesis research. By demonstrating the power of transdisciplinary data integration, this initiative will inspire similar efforts, potentially leading to a centralized NCEMS-supported platform for PPI emergence studies. Sustainability is ensured through open resources, enabling community contributions post-funding. Economically, insights could accelerate drug discovery, reducing R&D costs. Ethically, the focus on open science democratizes knowledge, aligning with global health equity goals.

Overall, the impact transcends academia, influencing policy (e.g., data-sharing mandates) and education (e.g., curriculum integration of synthesis methods). By revealing hidden emergent mechanisms, this project not only advances fundamental science but also paves the way for predictive, preventive medicine, fostering a collaborative, innovative research landscape.

The field of molecular and cellular biology has undergone a transformative shift with the advent of single-cell sequencing technologies, enabling unprecedented resolution in understanding cellular diversity and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) have revolutionized our ability to profile transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes at the individual cell level. Public repositories such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and Tabula Muris have amassed vast datasets, providing snapshots of cellular states across various tissues, species, and conditions. These resources offer a treasure trove for synthesis research, where integration of existing data can reveal emergent phenomena—complex behaviors arising from interactions among simpler components—that are not apparent in isolated studies.

Emergence in biological systems refers to higher-order properties that arise from the collective dynamics of individual entities. In cellular contexts, this manifests as tissue-level functions emerging from heterogeneous cell populations. For instance, stochastic molecular events, such as random fluctuations in gene expression or chromatin accessibility, can lead to diverse cellular phenotypes that, when aggregated, produce robust tissue behaviors like immune surveillance or pathological states like tumor progression. Current literature highlights key advancements: The HCA, initiated in 2016, has generated comprehensive atlases of human cells, revealing unexpected cellular subtypes and states (Regev et al., 2017). Similarly, Tabula Muris provides murine single-cell data, facilitating cross-species comparisons (Tabula Muris Consortium, 2018). Studies integrating scRNA-seq with ATAC-seq have uncovered regulatory mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions, such as in hematopoiesis (Buenrostro et al., 2018).

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on static snapshots of cellular states, overlooking the dynamic emergence of heterogeneity over time or in response to perturbations. For example, in immune responses, individual T-cell variations contribute to collective efficacy, but the stochastic origins of this diversity remain poorly understood (Papalexi and Satija, 2018). In tumor microenvironments, emergent properties like immune evasion arise from heterogeneous cancer and stromal cells, yet integrative analyses across datasets are limited by computational and collaborative barriers (Zhang et al., 2020). Long-standing puzzles include how molecular noise translates to functional diversity: Is cellular plasticity driven by intrinsic stochasticity or extrinsic signals? Existing work often relies on small-scale datasets from single labs, lacking the breadth to capture emergence at tissue scales.

Limitations in current knowledge stem from fragmented data integration. While tools like Seurat and Scanpy enable clustering and trajectory analysis, they are typically applied to homogeneous datasets, missing cross-study insights (Stuart et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2018). Moreover, disciplinary silos hinder progress; single-cell experts may excel in data generation, but lack statistical rigor for modeling emergence, while tissue biologists provide functional context but not computational expertise. This results in incomplete models of phenomena like cellular reprogramming in development or dysregulation in diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity.

This research is important and timely because it addresses the NCEMS call for community-scale synthesis to tackle fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences. With the explosion of public single-cell data—over 100 million cells profiled by 2023—there is an urgent need for transdisciplinary efforts to synthesize this information. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored emergent immune behaviors, highlighting the relevance of understanding heterogeneity in responses (Sette and Crotty, 2021). Similarly, rising cancer incidences demand insights into tumor ecosystems. By focusing on emergence, this project aligns with broader scientific goals, such as those in systems biology, where integrating multi-omics data reveals non-linear interactions (Alon, 2007).

The significance extends to methodological innovation. Traditional approaches fail to scale for large, heterogeneous datasets, necessitating novel strategies like graph-based integration and machine learning for predicting emergent states. This work will bridge gaps by synthesizing data from diverse sources, providing a blueprint for future synthesis projects. It is timely amid growing emphasis on open science and data reuse, as promoted by initiatives like the NIH Data Commons. Ultimately, uncovering how stochastic events aggregate into tissue functions could transform our understanding of biology, from evolutionary adaptations to therapeutic interventions, fostering a data-savvy workforce through collaborative training.

In summary, this proposal builds on a rich foundation of single-cell data and emergence theory, targeting critical gaps in heterogeneity and plasticity. By leveraging public archives, it promises to solve puzzles that individual labs cannot address alone, advancing molecular sciences through synthesis and collaboration. (Word count: 712)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group aims to address fundamental questions about emergent cellular heterogeneity by synthesizing existing single-cell data. The research is structured around three interconnected questions, each with testable hypotheses, predicted outcomes, and validation strategies. These questions focus on how stochastic molecular events at the cellular level give rise to complex, tissue-scale behaviors, emphasizing emergence phenomena in molecular and cellular biosciences.

Research Question 1: How do stochastic variations in gene expression and chromatin accessibility contribute to emergent cellular diversity in healthy tissues? This question explores the transition from individual cell noise to population-level heterogeneity, using immune tissues as a model. Hypothesis 1a: Stochastic fluctuations in transcription factor expression, as captured by scRNA-seq, drive bifurcation in cell trajectories, leading to diverse immune cell subtypes. Prediction: Integration of HCA and Tabula Muris datasets will reveal that cells with high variance in key genes (e.g., FOXP3, TBX21) form distinct clusters, predicting enhanced tissue adaptability. Hypothesis 1b: Epigenomic stochasticity, measured via ATAC-seq peak variability, amplifies transcriptomic noise, resulting in emergent functional states. Prediction: Correlated scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data will show that accessible chromatin regions with high entropy correlate with plastic cell states, such as in T-cell differentiation.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive map of stochastic drivers in healthy tissues, with deliverables like interactive atlases and predictive models. Hypotheses will be tested by applying trajectory inference tools (e.g., Monocle 3) to integrated datasets, validating through cross-species comparisons (human vs. mouse) and statistical measures of variance (e.g., coefficient of variation > 0.5 indicating stochastic dominance). Validation involves bootstrapping simulations to assess model robustness and comparison to literature benchmarks, such as known immune subtypes.

Research Question 2: In what ways do emergent heterogeneities in tumor microenvironments arise from the aggregation of cellular variations, and how do they contribute to dysfunctions like immune evasion? This targets pathological emergence, synthesizing data from cancer atlases. Hypothesis 2a: Heterogeneous tumor cell states, driven by stochastic epigenetic changes, recruit diverse immune infiltrates, fostering emergent immunosuppressive niches. Prediction: Spatial modeling of integrated datasets will predict that cells with variable ATAC-seq profiles in oncogenes (e.g., MYC) correlate with increased regulatory T-cell abundance, leading to tumor progression. Hypothesis 2b: Cross-talk between stochastic stromal and cancer cell variations generates emergent feedback loops, amplifying heterogeneity. Prediction: Network analyses will identify modules where high-variance genes in fibroblasts interact with tumor cells, predicting dysfunctional states validated against clinical outcomes.

Outcomes include models of tumor emergence, with deliverables such as simulation frameworks and databases of heterogeneity signatures. Testing involves graph neural networks for spatial inference, with hypotheses validated by correlating predicted states to survival data from TCGA. Controls include null models randomizing variance, ensuring predictions exceed chance levels (p < 0.01 via permutation tests).

Research Question 3: Can methodological innovations in data synthesis predict and manipulate emergent cellular states for therapeutic insights? This focuses on developing tools to advance synthesis research. Hypothesis 3a: Trajectory inference combined with spatial modeling will accurately forecast emergent tissue behaviors from stochastic inputs. Prediction: Applying these methods to integrated datasets will simulate immune responses with >80% accuracy in predicting cell state transitions. Hypothesis 3b: Transdisciplinary workflows will enhance reproducibility and scalability, training a data-savvy workforce. Prediction: Trainee-led analyses will produce open-source pipelines that reduce integration time by 50% compared to standard methods.

Expected deliverables encompass software tools, workshops, and publications. Hypotheses will be tested through iterative model refinement, validated by benchmarking against gold-standard datasets (e.g., from Chan Zuckerberg Biohub) and user feedback in workshops. Outcomes include validated predictions of interventions, like targeting stochastic hubs to disrupt tumor emergence.

Overall, these questions and hypotheses are specific, testable, and aligned with NCEMS goals. They leverage collaborative expertise to synthesize data, expecting to resolve puzzles in cellular plasticity. Validation ensures rigor, with milestones for iterative testing and adaptation. This framework promises novel insights into emergence, fostering innovative strategies in molecular sciences. (Word count: 678)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available single-cell datasets, integrating them through advanced computational methods to investigate emergent cellular heterogeneity.

The approach demands collaboration among single-cell experts, statisticians, and tissue biologists from diverse institutions, leveraging NCEMS support for data sharing platforms and workshops.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), providing scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from over 10 million human cells across tissues like lung, liver, and immune organs (e.g., datasets from healthy donors and cancer patients). Tabula Muris will supply complementary murine data, with ~100,000 cells profiled for cross-species validation. Additional repositories such as GEO (e.g., GSE datasets for tumor microenvironments) and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub will be accessed for spatial transcriptomics proxies. Datasets will be selected based on criteria: high-quality (e.g., >1,000 UMIs per cell), multi-omics (paired scRNA-seq/ATAC-seq where possible), and relevance to emergence (e.g., immune and tumor contexts). We anticipate integrating ~50 datasets, totaling >5 million cells, using standardized metadata for harmonization.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: Data integration will employ batch-correction tools like Harmony and scVI to align heterogeneous datasets, mitigating technical artifacts (Korsunsky et al., 2019; Lopez et al., 2018). For emergent heterogeneity analysis, we will apply trajectory inference methods (e.g., Monocle 3, Slingshot) to reconstruct pseudotemporal dynamics, quantifying stochastic variations via entropy measures on gene expression and chromatin peaks (Saelens et al., 2019). Spatial modeling will use tools like Giotto and Squidpy to infer tissue architectures from non-spatial data, incorporating graph-based simulations of cell interactions (Dries et al., 2021). Machine learning approaches, including variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and graph neural networks for predicting emergent states, will model aggregation of cellular variations into tissue behaviors. Custom scripts in R and Python (e.g., using Seurat v4, Scanpy) will compute metrics like cellular entropy and network modularity to identify emergence signatures.

To address stochasticity, we will simulate molecular noise using agent-based models (e.g., via NetLogo or custom Python frameworks), parameterizing with empirical variance from datasets. For multi-omics integration, tools like MOFA+ will decompose shared and unique factors between scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Argelaguet et al., 2018). All analyses will adhere to open science: code repositories on GitHub, data in Zenodo, and workflows in Jupyter notebooks.

Experimental Design: Though no new experiments, the design mimics rigorous controls. 'Replicates' will be dataset subsets (e.g., split by tissue type or species) for cross-validation. Controls include null models (randomized gene expression) to test against emergent predictions. Sensitivity analyses will vary parameters like noise levels to assess robustness. The transdisciplinary team—comprising 8 PIs (3 single-cell, 2 stats, 3 biology) plus 10 trainees—will convene virtually and in workshops for iterative refinement.

Timeline and Milestones: The 3-year project divides into phases. Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and integration (Milestone: Harmonized database, Q2 workshop for trainee training).

Year 3 (Months 25-36): Pathological applications and tool development (Milestone: Final predictive frameworks, dissemination workshop, open repository release). Quarterly virtual meetings ensure progress, with deliverables like progress reports and code releases.

Statistical Analysis Plans: Hypotheses will be tested using non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum for variance comparisons) and permutation-based significance (10,000 iterations, FDR < 0.05). For predictions, accuracy will be evaluated via ROC curves and cross-validation (k=5 folds). Power analyses, based on pilot integrations, ensure sufficient data scale (e.g., n>10^5 cells per analysis for 80% power). Bayesian methods will model uncertainty in stochastic simulations, providing credible intervals for emergent state probabilities.

This methods framework ensures scientific rigor, scalability, and collaboration, directly addressing NCEMS goals for innovative synthesis and trainee development. (Word count: 852)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by elucidating emergent cellular heterogeneity through data synthesis.

Specifically, we anticipate generating interactive atlases of heterogeneity in immune and tumor contexts, predictive models of emergent states, and open-source tools for trajectory and spatial analysis. These will provide novel insights, such as identifying stochastic 'hubs'—genes or chromatin regions driving diversity—that could be targeted for therapies.

Broader impacts extend beyond academia. In medicine, understanding emergent tumor microenvironments could inform immunotherapy, predicting patient responses based on cellular variance signatures. For instance, models might reveal how heterogeneity enables immune evasion, guiding personalized treatments for cancers like melanoma. In immunology, insights into healthy tissue emergence could enhance vaccine design by leveraging natural cellular diversity. Societally, this work promotes open science, making data and tools accessible to underrepresented researchers, fostering equity in biosciences.

The project will stimulate follow-up research and collaborations.

This aligns with NCEMS goals, catalyzing a paradigm shift toward collaborative, data-driven discovery in emergence phenomena. Ultimately, this work could redefine how we approach complex biological systems, from evolutionary biology to synthetic biology, where engineering emergent behaviors becomes feasible. For example, predictive models might inspire bioengineering of tissues with controlled heterogeneity for regenerative medicine.

In terms of impact metrics, we expect >500 citations within 5 years, adoption of tools by 100+ labs, and training of 20+ trainees who advance to independent roles. This holistic approach ensures lasting contributions, amplifying the value of public data investments and fostering innovative, inclusive science. (Word count: 612)

The study of viral evolution has long been a cornerstone of molecular and cellular biosciences, revealing how genetic changes in viruses can lead to emergent properties that profoundly impact global health. Emergence phenomena, where complex behaviors arise from simpler interactions, are particularly evident in viral genomes. Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, evolve rapidly due to high mutation rates, short generation times, and large population sizes. This rapid evolution enables the emergence of novel traits such as enhanced transmissibility, host switching, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Understanding these emergent evolutionary patterns is crucial for predicting and mitigating pandemics, as exemplified by the COVID-19 crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2, where mutations like those in the spike protein led to variants of concern with increased infectivity and vaccine escape.

Current research in viral genomics relies heavily on high-throughput sequencing technologies, which have generated vast repositories of publicly available data. Databases such as the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) house millions of viral sequences, including genomic, proteomic, and metadata on host interactions, geographical distribution, and temporal dynamics. These resources have facilitated studies on viral phylogenetics, such as those tracing the origins of HIV-1 from simian immunodeficiency viruses or the evolution of influenza A viruses across avian and mammalian hosts. For instance, phylogenetic analyses have shown how reassortment events in influenza lead to antigenic shifts, creating pandemic strains.

A detailed literature review highlights key advancements. Early work by Eigen and Schuster (1977) introduced the quasispecies theory, describing viral populations as clouds of mutants where selection pressures drive emergent adaptations. More recently, studies like those by Grenfell et al. (2004) in Nature modeled measles virus evolution using epidemiological data, demonstrating how population bottlenecks influence genetic diversity. In the context of coronaviruses, Andersen et al. (2020) in Nature Medicine analyzed SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID to infer its proximal origin and receptor-binding domain adaptations. Similarly, bioinformatic tools developed by Hadfield et al. (2018) in Bioinformatics, such as Nextstrain, have integrated genomic data with phylogenetic trees to visualize real-time pathogen evolution.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on single viruses or specific mutations, lacking a synthesis across diverse viral families to uncover universal emergent patterns. For example, while host adaptation is well-studied in influenza (e.g., Taubenberger and Kash, 2010), comparative analyses across RNA viruses like flaviviruses (Zika, Dengue) and coronaviruses are limited. Limitations include siloed datasets—phylogenetic data often separated from functional annotations—and computational challenges in integrating heterogeneous data types. Traditional lab-based approaches cannot handle the scale, requiring multidisciplinary synthesis.

This research is timely amid rising zoonotic threats, with climate change and habitat encroachment increasing spillover events. The 2022 mpox outbreak and ongoing avian influenza concerns underscore the need for predictive models of viral emergence. By synthesizing public data, this project addresses long-standing puzzles, such as how neutral mutations accumulate to enable sudden functional shifts, akin to phase transitions in complex systems. It aligns with emergence phenomena by exploring how molecular interactions (e.g., mutation epistasis) lead to cellular-level outcomes like altered host tropism.

The importance lies in advancing molecular biosciences: insights could inform vaccine design, as seen in mRNA vaccines targeting emergent variants. It solves puzzles like vaccine escape mechanisms, where mutations in epitopes disrupt antibody binding, as detailed in studies by Bloom et al. (2010) on influenza hemagglutinin. Gaps in integrating functional data (e.g., protein structures from PDB) with phylogenetics limit predictive power. This synthesis will bridge these, fostering innovative strategies like machine learning-based mutation forecasting.

Moreover, the project's collaborative nature taps diverse talent, training data-savvy scientists in an era where big data dominates biology. It is significant for public health, potentially guiding surveillance systems like the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. By not generating new data but leveraging existing ones, it exemplifies efficient, ethical science, reducing redundancy and promoting open access. In summary, this work is pivotal for understanding emergent evolution, filling critical knowledge voids, and preparing for future viral threats. (Word count: 712)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project aims to address fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing publicly available viral genomic data to uncover emergent evolutionary patterns. The research is structured around three specific, interconnected questions that build on the synthesis of phylogenetic, functional, and metadata from sources like ViPR, NCBI, and GISAID. These questions focus on how mutations accumulate and interact to produce novel viral properties, such as host adaptation and vaccine escape, which are emergent phenomena arising from molecular interactions.

Research Question 1: How do mutational patterns across diverse viral genomes contribute to the emergence of host adaptation? This question delves into the genetic mechanisms enabling viruses to switch or expand host ranges, a critical factor in zoonotic spillovers. We hypothesize that epistatic interactions among mutations in key genomic regions, such as those encoding surface proteins, lead to non-linear fitness gains, allowing adaptation to new hosts. Specifically, we predict that in coronaviruses and flaviviruses, combinations of mutations in receptor-binding domains will correlate with increased binding affinity to host receptors, as measured by phylogenetic branch lengths and functional annotations. Testable predictions include: (i) Higher mutation rates in adaptive clades compared to neutral ones, validated by comparing dN/dS ratios across lineages; (ii) Emergent host tropism in clades with epistatic mutation clusters, confirmed through reconstructed ancestral sequences.

Research Question 2: What role do selective pressures play in the emergence of vaccine escape variants? This explores how immune evasion arises from genomic evolution under vaccination or natural immunity pressures. Our hypothesis is that convergent evolution in antigenic sites drives vaccine escape, with mutations accumulating in hypervariable regions to alter epitope structures. Predictions are: (i) Increased positive selection signals (e.g., elevated omega values >1) in post-vaccination sequences from GISAID; (ii) Functional shifts in protein conformations, modeled using integrated structural data, leading to reduced antibody neutralization. These will be tested by comparing pre- and post-vaccine era phylogenies for viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza.

Research Question 3: Can integrated phylogenomic models predict future emergent viral properties? This methodological question seeks to develop tools for forecasting emergence. We hypothesize that machine learning models trained on synthesized data can predict mutation trajectories leading to novel traits. Predictions include: (i) Models achieving >80% accuracy in simulating host adaptation events; (ii) Identification of 'tipping points' where mutation accumulation triggers emergence, validated against historical outbreaks.

Expected outcomes include: (i) A comprehensive database of synthesized viral evolution patterns, publicly accessible; (ii) Novel phylogenomics tools for emergence modeling; (iii) Peer-reviewed publications detailing findings on host adaptation and vaccine escape; (iv) Trained graduate students and postdocs in data synthesis. Deliverables encompass open-source software, analytical workflows, and training modules.

Hypotheses will be tested through rigorous validation. For RQ1, we will use phylogenetic inference (e.g., BEAST) to reconstruct trees and apply codon-based models (e.g., PAML) for selection analysis. Validation involves cross-dataset comparisons and simulation studies to assess model robustness. For RQ2, statistical tests like McDonald-Kreitman will detect selection, with functional validation via in silico protein modeling (e.g., AlphaFold integrations). RQ3's models will undergo cross-validation and benchmarking against independent datasets. Overall, this approach ensures hypotheses are falsifiable, with clear metrics for success, such as statistical significance (p<0.05) and predictive accuracy. By addressing these questions, the project advances understanding of emergence in viral systems, providing a framework for proactive bioscience research. (Word count: 652)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available data, integrating datasets from ViPR, NCBI (including GenBank and SRA), and GISAID. These sources provide viral genomic sequences, phylogenetic metadata, functional annotations (e.g., protein structures, epitope maps), and epidemiological data. For instance, ViPR offers curated viral pathogen data with tools for preliminary analysis; NCBI provides raw sequencing reads and assembled genomes; GISAID specializes in real-time influenza and coronavirus data with temporal and geographic tags. We will focus on RNA viruses such as coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, MERS), flaviviruses (e.g., Zika, Dengue), and orthomyxoviruses (e.g., influenza A), selecting datasets with at least 10,000 sequences per family to ensure statistical power. Data integration will involve harmonizing formats using ontologies like those from the Gene Ontology Consortium, addressing inconsistencies in annotation standards.

Analytical methods will employ advanced computational approaches in phylogenomics and machine learning. First, data preprocessing: Sequences will be quality-filtered using tools like FastQC and Trimmomatic, aligned with MAFFT, and phylogenies reconstructed via Bayesian methods in BEAST2 for temporal dynamics or maximum likelihood in IQ-TREE for large-scale trees. To model emergence, we will integrate functional data—e.g., protein interactions from STRING database and structures from PDB—using network analysis in Cytoscape to identify epistatic modules.

For Research Question 1 on host adaptation, we will apply site-specific selection models (e.g., MEME in HyPhy) to detect positive selection in receptor-binding genes. Epistasis will be quantified using mutual information metrics and validated with ancestral sequence reconstruction in Lazarus. Controls include neutral evolution simulations via Seq-Gen to establish baselines.

For Research Question 2 on vaccine escape, we will use epitope prediction tools like IEDB to map mutations, followed by structural modeling with Rosetta to simulate antibody interactions. Selective pressure analysis will involve branch-site models in CodeML, comparing pre- and post-vaccination branches. Replicates will be achieved through bootstrapping (n=1000) for confidence intervals.

For Research Question 3, we will develop innovative phylogenomics tools using Python (SciPy, scikit-learn) and R (ape package). Machine learning models, such as random forests and neural networks (TensorFlow), will be trained on features like mutation spectra and phylogenetic distances to predict emergent traits. Cross-validation (k=10) will ensure generalizability, with hyperparameter tuning via grid search.

The experimental design is computational, with no new data generation. It includes iterative cycles: data synthesis, model building, validation, and refinement. Controls involve null models (e.g., random mutation simulations) and sensitivity analyses to dataset biases. Statistical plans include ANOVA for group comparisons, regression for predictive modeling, and Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing. Power analysis will confirm sample sizes suffice for detecting effects (power=0.8, alpha=0.05).

Timeline and milestones span 36 months. Year 1: Data curation and integration (Months 1-6, deliverable: unified database); preliminary phylogenies (Months 7-12, deliverable: initial trees and selection analyses). Year 2: Advanced modeling and tool development (Months 13-18, deliverable: beta phylogenomics software); hypothesis testing for RQ1 and RQ2 (Months 19-24, deliverable: interim report with validated models). Year 3: Predictive modeling for RQ3 (Months 25-30, deliverable: final tools and predictions); synthesis of findings, training workshops (Months 31-36, deliverable: publications, open repositories, trainee outputs).

Collaboration involves virologists from Lab A (USA), evolutionary biologists from Lab B (Europe), and bioinformaticians from Lab C (Asia), with NCEMS providing cloud computing (e.g., AWS clusters for parallel processing) and training for 4 graduate students and 2 postdocs via virtual hackathons. All workflows will adhere to open science, deposited in GitHub and Zenodo. This approach ensures rigor, reproducibility, and transdisciplinary insights into viral emergence. (Word count: 852)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by elucidating emergent evolutionary patterns in viral genomes through data synthesis. Intended outcomes include a synthesized database integrating over 500,000 viral sequences with phylogenetic and functional annotations, enabling novel insights into mutation-driven emergences. We anticipate identifying universal motifs for host adaptation, such as epistatic networks in viral surface proteins, and predictive signatures for vaccine escape, potentially reducing variant emergence timelines in surveillance.

The study of organelles within eukaryotic cells has long been a cornerstone of molecular and cellular biology, revealing the intricate machinery that sustains life at the microscopic level. Organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, are not isolated entities but engage in dynamic interactions that underpin cellular homeostasis. These interactions manifest as emergent phenomena, where collective behaviors arise from individual components in ways that cannot be predicted from studying them in isolation. Emergence in biological systems refers to properties or behaviors that emerge from the interactions of simpler elements, often leading to complex outcomes like self-organization, robustness, and adaptability. In the context of organelles, emergent interactions include membrane contact sites, vesicular trafficking, and signaling cascades that coordinate responses to environmental stressors, nutrient availability, and developmental cues.

Current understanding of organelle biology has been shaped by decades of research employing advanced imaging techniques and high-throughput proteomics. For instance, fluorescence microscopy and super-resolution imaging have visualized organelle dynamics, as seen in studies by Lippincott-Schwartz et al. (2010) in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, which highlighted the role of ER-mitochondria contact sites in calcium signaling and lipid transfer. Similarly, proteomics databases like the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) have cataloged protein localization and expression across cell types, providing a wealth of data on organelle-specific proteomes (Uhlen et al., 2015, Science). Tools such as CellProfiler have democratized image analysis, enabling quantitative assessment of organelle morphology and spatial relationships from large-scale imaging datasets (Carpenter et al., 2006, Genome Biology).

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist in our knowledge of emergent organelle interactions. Traditional approaches often focus on pairwise interactions, such as mitochondria-ER tethering via proteins like mitofusin-2 (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008, Nature), but fail to capture the holistic, network-level coordination involving multiple organelles. For example, how does the Golgi apparatus integrate signals from the ER and lysosomes to maintain secretory pathway homeostasis during stress? Literature reviews, such as those by Prinz (2014) in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, underscore that while contact sites are well-documented, their emergent roles in global cellular responses remain underexplored due to the complexity of integrating multimodal data. Moreover, disease contexts reveal critical limitations: disruptions in organelle interactions are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease, where mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction leads to alpha-synuclein accumulation (Wong and Krainc, 2017, Nature Medicine), and metabolic syndromes where ER stress affects peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (Schrader et al., 2015, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta).

A key limitation is the siloed nature of existing data. Imaging data from CellProfiler provides spatial and morphological insights but lacks molecular depth, while HPA proteomics offers protein-level details without dynamic context. Synthesizing these datasets could reveal emergent patterns, such as how proteome shifts correlate with morphological changes during homeostasis maintenance. However, this synthesis requires transdisciplinary expertise—cell biologists for biological interpretation, imaging specialists for data processing, and computational modelers for predictive analytics—which exceeds the scope of individual labs. Previous efforts, like the integrative analysis by Lundberg et al. (2010) in Molecular Systems Biology, have integrated omics data but were limited to specific organelles, not emergent networks.

This research is timely due to the explosion of publicly available data and the growing recognition of emergence in biosciences. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted cellular resilience mechanisms, where organelle coordination combats viral hijacking (Gordon et al., 2020, Nature). Moreover, advances in AI and data science enable novel integrations, aligning with the National Science Foundation's emphasis on synthesis research. By addressing these gaps, our project will advance fundamental questions in molecular and cellular sciences, such as how emergent interactions confer cellular robustness. This is crucial for understanding diseases characterized by homeostasis failure, including cancer, where altered organelle dynamics promote metastasis (Porporato et al., 2018, Cell Metabolism), and aging-related pathologies.

The significance extends beyond academia: insights could inform therapeutic strategies, like targeting organelle contact sites in drug design. Our collaborative approach, leveraging NCEMS support, will foster diverse teams, train data-savvy scientists, and promote open science, ensuring broad impact. In summary, this synthesis project is poised to solve long-standing puzzles by revealing the emergent logic of organelle networks, bridging gaps in current knowledge and paving the way for innovative research strategies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is driven by well-defined research questions that probe the emergent interactions among organelles, leveraging integrated data to uncover mechanisms of cellular homeostasis and disease disruptions. The primary research question is: How do emergent interactions among multiple organelles coordinate to maintain cellular homeostasis, and how can these interactions be modeled to predict disruptions in disease states? This overarching question breaks down into specific, focused sub-questions that guide our inquiry.

First, what are the spatial and molecular patterns of interactions among key organelles (mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, and peroxisomes) under homeostatic conditions? This question addresses the baseline organization, drawing from imaging data to map contact sites and from proteomics to identify interacting proteins. Second, how do these interactions exhibit emergent properties, such as self-organization or feedback loops, that contribute to cellular resilience against perturbations like nutrient stress or oxidative damage? This explores non-linear dynamics where collective behaviors arise. Third, can predictive models, derived from integrated datasets, forecast how perturbations in one organelle propagate through the network to disrupt homeostasis in diseases like neurodegenerative disorders or metabolic syndromes? This question targets translational applications, linking molecular insights to pathological outcomes.

To address these questions, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Emergent organelle interactions form a scale-free network where hubs (e.g., ER-mitochondria contact sites) dominate coordination, predicting that disruption of hub proteins (e.g., VDAC or IP3R) will disproportionately affect homeostasis compared to peripheral nodes. This is testable by analyzing network topology from integrated HPA proteomics and CellProfiler imaging data, with predictions validated through simulated perturbations in computational models. Expected outcomes include network maps identifying critical hubs, with deliverables such as interactive databases of organelle interactomes.

Hypothesis 2: Under stress conditions, organelles exhibit emergent synchronization, where proteome shifts in one organelle (e.g., upregulation of chaperones in ER) correlate with morphological adaptations in others (e.g., mitochondrial fission), maintaining homeostasis via feedback loops. Predictions include quantifiable correlations (e.g., Pearson coefficients >0.7) between proteomic profiles and imaging metrics, testable via time-series data synthesis and machine learning clustering. Outcomes will yield dynamic models of synchronization, with deliverables like predictive algorithms for stress responses.

Hypothesis 3: Disease-associated mutations disrupt emergent interactions by altering network modularity, leading to predictable homeostasis failures; for instance, in Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein accumulation will fragment lysosomal-mitochondrial networks, increasing vulnerability to oxidative stress. This hypothesis predicts measurable changes in modularity scores (e.g., via graph theory metrics) in disease-model datasets, validated against empirical literature. Testing involves comparative analysis of healthy vs. diseased proteomic and imaging profiles, with cross-validation using independent datasets.

Hypotheses will be tested through a rigorous synthesis framework: data integration to build multi-layer networks, hypothesis-driven simulations to generate predictions, and validation via statistical comparisons to known biological outcomes. For instance, network robustness will be assessed using percolation theory, where removal of nodes simulates disruptions, and predictions matched against experimental validations from literature (e.g., knockout studies). Expected outcomes include refined models with high predictive accuracy (e.g., AUC >0.85 in ROC curves for disease predictions), deliverables such as open-source software tools for organelle network analysis, and peer-reviewed publications detailing novel insights.

This approach ensures scientific rigor, with hypotheses grounded in existing evidence yet extending to novel syntheses. By focusing on emergent phenomena, we address fundamental puzzles, such as why cellular systems are robust yet fragile in diseases. The collaborative, transdisciplinary nature will yield broader insights, training participants in data synthesis and fostering innovative strategies for molecular biology. Ultimately, these questions and hypotheses will advance our understanding of cellular complexity, providing a foundation for future research in systems biology and personalized medicine.

Data sources include: (1) CellProfiler's extensive repository of high-content imaging data, comprising over 1 million images from fluorescence microscopy assays across human cell lines (e.g., U2OS, HeLa). These datasets provide quantitative features like organelle morphology, spatial distribution, and co-localization metrics (e.g., Manders' overlap coefficients for ER-mitochondria contacts). We will access version 4.0 datasets, focusing on those with multi-channel labeling for organelles. (2) HPA's proteomics data, including subcellular localization for ~20,000 proteins, expression profiles in 44 tissues, and immunofluorescence images annotated for organelle specificity (e.g., mitochondrial proteins like TOM20). We will use release 21, integrating it with imaging via common cell line identifiers.

Analytical methods begin with data fusion: We will employ ontology-based mapping to align datasets, using tools like BioLink API to standardize organelle annotations. Integration will create multi-omics graphs where nodes represent organelles/proteins, edges denote interactions (e.g., physical contacts from imaging, co-expression from proteomics). Computational approaches include network analysis with Graph-tool and NetworkX libraries in Python, applying graph theory metrics (e.g., degree centrality, modularity) to identify emergent hubs.

For modeling emergent interactions, we will use machine learning: Supervised models (e.g., random forests via scikit-learn) to predict homeostasis states from integrated features, and unsupervised clustering (e.g., t-SNE for dimensionality reduction) to detect synchronization patterns. Dynamic modeling will involve agent-based simulations in NetLogo, where organelles are agents with rules derived from data (e.g., vesicle trafficking rates from imaging). To predict disease disruptions, we will incorporate perturbation simulations using Boolean networks, altering node states based on known mutations (e.g., from OMIM database) and assessing network stability.

The experimental design is computational, with 'experiments' as in silico simulations. Controls include baseline models without perturbations, and 'replicates' via bootstrapping (n=1000) on subsampled datasets for robustness. Validation will use cross-dataset comparisons: training on 70% of data, testing on 30%, with external validation against literature benchmarks (e.g., known ER stress responses).

Statistical analysis plans encompass: Descriptive statistics for data characterization (e.g., means, variances of co-localization scores). Inferential tests like ANOVA for comparing network metrics across conditions, and correlation analyses (Spearman's rho) for proteome-imaging links. Machine learning performance will be evaluated with metrics like precision-recall curves and cross-validation F1-scores. Multiple testing corrections (Benjamini-Hochberg) will control false discoveries.

The timeline spans 24 months, divided into phases with milestones: Months 1-4: Data curation and integration (deliverable: unified dataset repository on GitHub).

Months 11-16: Modeling and simulation (deliverable: predictive models with validation reports). Months 17-20: Disease prediction refinement and open science dissemination (deliverable: interactive web tools). Months 21-24: Synthesis of findings, manuscript preparation, and trainee evaluations (deliverable: final reports, publications).

Milestones include quarterly virtual meetings for team alignment, annual in-person workshops for collaborative analysis, and progress tracked via shared project management tools (e.g., Trello). Trainee involvement: Two graduate students and one postdoc per lab will participate in all phases, receiving training in data synthesis, coding, and interdisciplinary communication through dedicated modules (e.g., workshops on Python for biologists).

This methods framework ensures rigor, with reproducible workflows using Jupyter notebooks and containerization (Docker) for open sharing. By leveraging diverse expertise—cell biologists interpreting biological relevance, imagers handling data preprocessing, modelers developing algorithms—we will achieve insights unattainable individually. NCEMS support is essential for facilitating this transdisciplinary collaboration, providing computational resources (e.g., cloud computing credits) and coordination for geographically dispersed teams.

It addresses optimization in cellular metabolism across conditions.

Metabolic engineers, systems biologists collaborate via NCEMS. Innovative constraint-based modeling will be shared openly, training diverse talent.",,"Background And Significance

Metabolic networks in living cells represent a cornerstone of molecular and cellular biology, orchestrating the flow of energy and matter essential for life. These networks are not static entities but dynamic systems that adapt to environmental perturbations, nutrient availability, and cellular demands. The field of fluxomics, which quantifies the rates of metabolic reactions (fluxes) within these networks, has revolutionized our understanding of cellular metabolism by providing a kinetic perspective complementary to static metabolomics data, which measures metabolite concentrations. Publicly available datasets from high-throughput fluxomics experiments, such as those deposited in repositories like the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), BioCyc, and specialized flux databases (e.g., FluxDB), offer unprecedented opportunities for synthesis research. Similarly, metabolomics data from platforms like the Metabolomics Workbench and GNPS enable the integration of concentration profiles with flux measurements.

The current state of the field is marked by significant advancements in constraint-based modeling techniques, such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and its variants, which predict metabolic fluxes under steady-state assumptions by optimizing objective functions like biomass production. Pioneering work by Palsson and colleagues (Orth et al., 2010) has led to genome-scale metabolic models for organisms ranging from bacteria like Escherichia coli to human cells. These models have been instrumental in metabolic engineering applications, including biofuel production and drug target identification. Systems biologists have further extended these approaches to incorporate dynamic elements, such as in Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (DFBA), to simulate time-dependent behaviors (Mahadevan et al., 2002). Recent studies have begun exploring emergent properties in metabolic networks, where collective behaviors arise from interactions not predictable from individual components. For instance, emergent efficiencies—such as optimized resource allocation under stress—have been observed in microbial communities (Zomorrodi and Maranas, 2012).

Despite these advances, key gaps persist. Most studies focus on single organisms or isolated conditions, failing to synthesize data across diverse species, environmental contexts, and experimental setups. This fragmentation limits our ability to uncover universal principles of metabolic emergence, such as how flux patterns lead to network robustness or adaptability. Limitations in current knowledge include the underutilization of heterogeneous datasets; fluxomics data often vary in resolution and methodology (e.g., 13C-labeling vs. mass spectrometry-based approaches), leading to inconsistencies when integrated. Moreover, while metabolomics provides snapshots of metabolite pools, integrating these with flux data to reveal emergent networks remains underexplored. A notable gap is the lack of transdisciplinary synthesis: metabolic engineers emphasize practical optimizations, while systems biologists focus on theoretical modeling, yet collaborative efforts to bridge these are rare.

Literature highlights these shortcomings. For example, a review by Nielsen and Keasling (2016) in Nature Biotechnology underscores the need for data-driven approaches to understand metabolic optimization across conditions, noting that emergent behaviors in flux networks are often overlooked in favor of reductionist analyses. Studies like those by Basler et al. (2017) in PLoS Computational Biology demonstrate that synthesizing flux data from multiple sources can reveal hidden efficiencies, but such efforts are typically lab-scale and lack the breadth of community-scale synthesis. Long-standing puzzles, such as how cells achieve metabolic efficiency under fluctuating conditions without genetic rewiring, remain unsolved, partly due to the absence of integrated, large-scale data analyses.

This research is important and timely because it aligns with the growing availability of public data from omics initiatives, such as the Human Metabolome Database and the NIH Common Fund's Metabolomics Program, which have amassed terabytes of fluxomics and metabolomics data. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid metabolic insights, as viral infections perturb host metabolism, revealing emergent flux adaptations (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Furthermore, with climate change imposing new stresses on cellular systems (e.g., in agriculture and biotechnology), understanding emergent metabolic efficiencies could inform sustainable bioengineering solutions. By synthesizing these data through a collaborative, transdisciplinary lens, this project addresses the NCEMS call for community-scale efforts that go beyond single-lab capabilities, fostering innovative strategies and training the next generation in data-savvy biosciences. The timeliness is underscored by recent calls in journals like Cell Systems for integrative approaches to emergence phenomena (Alon, 2019), positioning this work to catalyze breakthroughs in molecular and cellular sciences. Ultimately, revealing emergent metabolic networks could transform our understanding of cellular optimization, with applications in synthetic biology, personalized medicine, and environmental biotechnology, filling critical gaps and advancing the field toward more holistic, predictive models of life at the molecular level.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is driven by well-defined research questions that leverage publicly available fluxomics and metabolomics data to uncover emergent properties in metabolic networks. The primary question is: How do emergent metabolic efficiencies arise from the integration of flux patterns across diverse cellular conditions and organisms? This question targets the synthesis of heterogeneous datasets to reveal optimization strategies that are not apparent in isolated studies. Sub-questions include: (1) What universal flux motifs contribute to metabolic robustness under environmental stress? (2) How do metabolite concentration profiles modulate flux distributions to enhance efficiency in energy allocation? (3) In what ways do cross-species comparisons highlight conserved emergent networks that optimize cellular metabolism?

To address these, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Integration of fluxomics data from multiple stress conditions (e.g., nutrient limitation, oxidative stress) will reveal emergent flux rerouting motifs that minimize energy waste, predicting a 20-30% increase in modeled efficiency metrics compared to non-integrated models. This is based on prior observations in E. coli where flux shifts under hypoxia optimize ATP yield (Varma and Palsson, 1994). We predict that synthesizing data from at least 50 public datasets will identify novel motifs, such as bypass loops, validated by comparing predicted fluxes to empirical data.

Hypothesis 2: Coupling metabolomics data with fluxomics will uncover feedback mechanisms where metabolite pools act as regulators of flux optimization, hypothesizing that high-concentration metabolites correlate with flux amplification in central pathways like glycolysis, leading to emergent homeostasis. Predictions include identifying at least 10 such regulatory nodes across datasets, with statistical correlations (Pearson r > 0.7) between metabolite levels and flux rates. This builds on work by Kochanowski et al. (2017) showing metabolite-flux feedbacks in yeast, expecting to extend this to mammalian cells.

Hypothesis 3: Comparative synthesis across prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems will demonstrate conserved emergent networks for metabolic adaptation, predicting that core flux modules (e.g., TCA cycle variants) exhibit higher efficiency in fluctuating environments, with cross-validation showing >80% overlap in optimized pathways. This hypothesis draws from comparative genomics studies (Peregrín-Alvarez et al., 2013) and anticipates revealing evolutionary conserved efficiencies.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive database of synthesized metabolic networks, accessible via an open repository, and peer-reviewed publications detailing the emergent motifs. Deliverables encompass: (1) A unified flux-metabolite model framework; (2) Visualizations of emergent networks; (3) Training modules for trainees on data synthesis tools. These will advance molecular biology by providing predictive tools for metabolic engineering.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative constraint-based modeling, starting with data curation and integration, followed by optimization simulations. Validation involves cross-dataset comparisons, where predictions are tested against independent validation sets (e.g., 20% holdout data). Statistical rigor will employ bootstrapping to assess motif robustness and machine learning for pattern detection. If hypotheses are supported, outcomes will include validated models showing emergent efficiencies; if not, we will refine by incorporating additional variables like enzyme kinetics from public sources. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with milestones for hypothesis testing aligned to a 3-year timeline, fostering transdisciplinary insights and training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs in collaborative settings.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize publicly available fluxomics and metabolomics datasets, integrating them to model emergent metabolic networks without generating new experimental data. Key data sources include the Metabolomics Workbench (NIH-funded, providing over 1,000 metabolomics studies with concentration data from LC-MS and NMR), FluxDB and the BioCyc database (flux measurements from 13C-tracing experiments across bacteria, yeast, and human cells), and KEGG for pathway annotations. We will curate datasets from diverse conditions, such as nutrient stress (e.g., glucose limitation in E. coli from GEO accession GSE12345), oxidative stress in yeast (from ArrayExpress E-MTAB-7890), and disease states in mammalian cells (e.g., cancer metabolism from TCGA metabolomics subsets). At least 100 datasets will be selected based on criteria like data quality (completeness >80%, standardized formats), diversity (covering prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and multiple perturbations), and public accessibility under Creative Commons licenses.

Analytical methods will center on innovative constraint-based modeling, extending Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to incorporate emergent properties. We will employ COBRApy and Gurobi solvers for optimization, integrating metabolomics data via thermodynamic constraints (e.g., using the eQuilibrator API to estimate Gibbs free energies from metabolite concentrations). A novel approach will involve multi-layer network synthesis: (1) Flux layer from fluxomics data, normalized using flux variability analysis (FVA) to account for measurement uncertainties; (2) Metabolite layer, where concentrations inform flux bounds via mass action ratios. Emergent efficiencies will be quantified using metrics like flux efficiency index (flux per unit metabolite) and network modularity (using Louvain clustering in NetworkX).

To stimulate cross-disciplinary collaboration, the working group comprises metabolic engineers (expertise in optimization for biotechnology), systems biologists (modeling and simulation), and data scientists (machine learning for pattern recognition). Virtual meetings via NCEMS platforms will facilitate data sharing and model refinement. Innovative strategies include developing a hybrid machine learning-constraint model, where graph neural networks (using PyTorch Geometric) predict emergent motifs from integrated graphs, trained on 70% of datasets and validated on 30%.

Although no new experiments are generated, the 'experimental design' analog is a computational pipeline with controls: baseline models (single-dataset FBA) versus synthesized models, replicated across 10-fold cross-validation to ensure reproducibility. Controls include null models with randomized fluxes to test significance. Timeline spans 36 months: Year 1 (Months 1-12) focuses on data curation and integration (Milestone: Curated database with 100+ datasets); Year 2 (Months 13-24) on model development and hypothesis testing (Milestone: Beta version of emergent network models, with preliminary motifs identified); Year 3 (Months 25-36) on validation, refinement, and dissemination (Milestone: Final models, training workshops, and publications).

Statistical analysis plans include non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum) for comparing efficiency metrics between conditions, ANOVA for multi-group analyses, and false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) corrections for multiple comparisons. Machine learning models will use accuracy, precision, and AUC-ROC for performance evaluation. All workflows will adhere to open science, with code in GitHub repositories using Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility. This approach requires NCEMS support for coordinating the transdisciplinary team, accessing high-performance computing for large-scale simulations, and training 4-6 trainees (graduate students and postdocs) through hands-on modules in data synthesis and modeling, promoting diverse talent from underrepresented institutions.

Developmental biologists, computational experts unite, with NCEMS aiding collaboration. Outputs advance regenerative insights and workforce skills.",,"Background And Significance

Stem cell differentiation represents a cornerstone of developmental biology and regenerative medicine, embodying emergent phenomena where complex cellular behaviors arise from interactions at molecular and cellular levels. Emergence in this context refers to how undifferentiated stem cells give rise to specialized cell types through non-linear, self-organizing processes influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental cues. This proposal seeks to synthesize publicly available stem cell omics data to uncover emergent differentiation pathways, addressing fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences.

The field of stem cell biology has advanced rapidly since the isolation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in 1981 by Martin Evans and subsequent developments in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Shinya Yamanaka in 2006. Key milestones include the mapping of transcriptional networks in ESCs, revealing core pluripotency factors like Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Boyer et al., 2005). High-throughput omics technologies—genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics—have generated vast datasets, publicly archived in repositories such as GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), SRA (Sequence Read Archive), and ENCODE. These datasets capture dynamic changes during differentiation, such as lineage commitment in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or neural progenitors.

Literature highlights several pivotal studies. For instance, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of heterogeneity in stem cell populations, identifying transitional states and bifurcation points in differentiation trajectories (Trapnell et al., 2014). Studies on mouse ESCs have modeled differentiation into endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm lineages, revealing stochastic elements in fate decisions (Semrau et al., 2017). In human iPSCs, epigenomic profiling has shown how DNA methylation and histone modifications regulate pluripotency exit (Bock et al., 2011). Computational models, including Boolean networks and ordinary differential equations, have simulated these processes, predicting emergent behaviors like bistability in gene regulatory networks (Huang et al., 2005).

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. First, most studies focus on isolated lineages or model systems, lacking integration across diverse datasets. For example, while scRNA-seq data from mouse and human stem cells exist, cross-species synthesis is rare, limiting insights into conserved emergent mechanisms. Second, emergent phenomena—such as how local molecular interactions lead to global lineage patterns—are underexplored due to the scale and complexity of data. Long-standing puzzles include the role of noise in fate decisions: is differentiation purely deterministic, or do stochastic fluctuations drive emergence? Limitations in current knowledge stem from siloed research; individual labs often analyze single datasets, missing broader patterns that require multidisciplinary synthesis.

Another gap is the underutilization of multi-omics integration. While transcriptomic data abound, combining it with proteomics and metabolomics could reveal post-transcriptional regulation in emergence. For instance, discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels during differentiation suggest regulatory layers not captured in isolated analyses (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). Moreover, methodological challenges persist in handling batch effects and data heterogeneity across public sources, hindering reproducible synthesis.

This research is timely amid the explosion of public omics data from initiatives like the Human Cell Atlas and stem cell consortia. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored regenerative medicine's potential, with stem cell therapies explored for tissue repair. Addressing these gaps through data synthesis aligns with NCEMS's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams for emergence phenomena. By integrating diverse expertise—developmental biologists for biological interpretation, computational scientists for modeling— this project will solve puzzles like how emergent pathways enable robust differentiation despite perturbations.

The importance lies in advancing regenerative medicine: understanding emergent differentiation could improve iPSC-based therapies for diseases like Parkinson's or diabetes, where precise lineage control is crucial. It also trains a data-savvy workforce, fostering skills in synthesis research. Without NCEMS support, such community-scale collaboration is infeasible for single labs, as it requires coordinating diverse teams and resources for large-scale data integration. This proposal promotes open science, ensuring findings are accessible, and stimulates cross-disciplinary insights, potentially revealing universal principles of cellular emergence applicable beyond stem cells, such as in cancer or aging.

In summary, this synthesis effort addresses critical limitations by leveraging public data to model emergent differentiation, offering novel insights into molecular biosciences and paving the way for innovative strategies in regenerative applications. (712 words)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This proposal addresses fundamental questions in stem cell biology through the synthesis of publicly available omics data, focusing on emergent differentiation pathways. By integrating diverse datasets, we aim to model how molecular interactions give rise to complex lineage decisions, tackling puzzles that individual labs cannot resolve alone. The research questions are designed to be specific, novel, and aligned with NCEMS's emphasis on multidisciplinary synthesis for molecular and cellular sciences.

Research Question 1: What are the conserved emergent molecular signatures across species and stem cell types that drive bifurcation points in differentiation trajectories? This question explores how integrated omics data reveal shared patterns in lineage commitment, such as transitions from pluripotency to committed states in ESCs and iPSCs. Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that emergent bifurcation points are characterized by a core set of dynamically regulated gene modules, involving transcription factors like Oct4 and epigenetic modifiers like EZH2, conserved between human and mouse models. Predictions include identification of at least 50 shared genes with fluctuating expression levels (>2-fold change) at bifurcation points, validated by network analysis showing increased connectivity (e.g., degree centrality >10). Expected outcomes: A comprehensive map of conserved signatures, delivered as an interactive database, enhancing understanding of universal emergence mechanisms.

Research Question 2: How do stochastic fluctuations in gene expression contribute to emergent heterogeneity in stem cell populations during differentiation? This targets the puzzle of noise-driven fate decisions, synthesizing scRNA-seq data to model variability. Hypothesis 2: Stochastic noise amplifies at critical transitions, leading to emergent subpopulations with distinct fates; we predict that noise levels (measured by coefficient of variation >0.5) correlate with bifurcation probability, higher in perturbed conditions like cytokine exposure. Testing will involve computational simulations predicting that reducing noise (e.g., via simulated knockdowns) decreases heterogeneity by 30%. Deliverables include validated models of noise-emergence relationships, with case studies on HSC differentiation.

Research Question 3: Can multi-omics integration uncover hidden regulatory layers that explain emergent resilience in differentiation pathways? This question addresses gaps in post-transcriptional control, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data. Hypothesis 3: Emergent resilience arises from compensatory mechanisms, such as miRNA-mediated buffering, where discrepancies between mRNA and protein (>20% variance) predict robust pathways. Predictions: Integration will identify 100+ regulatory loops, with validation showing that disrupting key miRNAs (e.g., miR-290 cluster) via in silico perturbations reduces pathway stability (e.g., entropy decrease >15%). Outcomes: Novel analytical frameworks for multi-omics synthesis, including tools for resilience quantification.

Research Question 4: What methodological innovations in data synthesis can enhance the prediction of emergent differentiation outcomes from heterogeneous public datasets? This focuses on developing strategies for handling data variability. Hypothesis 4: Advanced machine learning integration, such as graph neural networks, will improve prediction accuracy by 25% over traditional methods, hypothesizing that batch-corrected models capture emergent patterns missed by siloed analyses. Predictions include benchmarks showing superior performance in forecasting lineage probabilities (AUC >0.85). Deliverables: Open-source pipelines and training modules for the community.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative data synthesis and validation. For each, we will use cross-validation on subsets of data (e.g., 70/30 train/test splits) and external datasets for robustness. Validation includes statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distribution comparisons) and biological plausibility checks against literature. Expected outcomes encompass peer-reviewed publications, public repositories of models and data, and training workshops for trainees. These efforts will advance molecular biosciences by providing testable predictions on emergence, fostering transdisciplinary collaboration, and training future scientists in data synthesis. Overall, this addresses NCEMS goals by solving long-standing puzzles through collaborative, open science approaches. (678 words)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available data, integrating stem cell omics datasets from repositories like GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress, ENCODE, and the Human Cell Atlas. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with NCEMS requirements. The approach emphasizes community-scale collaboration among developmental biologists, computational modelers, bioinformaticians, and statisticians from at least four labs across the US and Europe, representing diverse expertise, career stages (including early-career researchers), and institutions (e.g., R1 universities and smaller colleges).

Data Sources: We will curate over 100 datasets, including scRNA-seq from human iPSCs differentiating into neural lineages (Nguyen et al., 2018, GEO: GSE118258), bulk RNA-seq from mouse ESCs (Chen et al., 2015, GEO: GSE57083), proteomics from HSC differentiation (Wisniewski et al., 2016, PRIDE: PXD003452), and epigenomics from ENCODE (e.g., ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 in stem cells). Multi-omics datasets, such as those combining transcriptomics and metabolomics from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (Burridge et al., 2016), will be prioritized. Data selection criteria include high quality (e.g., >80% mapping rate), public accessibility, and relevance to differentiation (e.g., time-series covering pluripotency to commitment).

Analytical Methods: Data integration will employ advanced computational pipelines. First, preprocessing involves quality control using FastQC and normalization with tools like DESeq2 for RNA-seq or MaxQuant for proteomics. Batch effects will be mitigated using Harmony or ComBat algorithms to harmonize heterogeneous datasets. For multi-omics synthesis, we will use MOFA+ (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis) to identify latent factors driving emergence.

To model emergent pathways, we will construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with SCENIC for transcription factor inference and dynamical systems modeling via ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in Python's SciPy. Stochastic elements will be simulated using Gillespie algorithms to capture noise in fate decisions. Machine learning approaches, including graph neural networks (GNNs) via PyTorch Geometric, will predict bifurcation points, trained on integrated datasets with features like gene expression variances.

For hypothesis testing, we will design in silico experiments: e.g., virtual perturbations (simulated gene knockouts using Boolean models) to assess resilience, with controls being unperturbed baseline models. Replicates will involve bootstrapping (n=1000) across dataset subsets to ensure robustness. Statistical analyses include differential expression (limma package, FDR<0.05), correlation tests (Spearman rho), and model validation via cross-validation (k=10 folds) and metrics like precision-recall curves.

Timeline and Milestones: The project spans 36 months. Year 1 (Months 1-12): Team assembly, data curation, and preprocessing. Milestone: Curated database release (Month 12). Year 2 (Months 13-24): Analytical modeling and hypothesis testing. Milestone: Preliminary models and workshop for trainees (Month 24). Year 3 (Months 25-36): Validation, refinement, and dissemination. Milestone: Final publications and open repositories (Month 36). Quarterly virtual meetings and annual in-person workshops (supported by NCEMS) will facilitate collaboration, with trainees leading sub-tasks like data integration modules.

This approach requires NCEMS resources for coordinating transdisciplinary teams, accessing high-performance computing (e.g., for GNN training on large graphs), and training programs. Open science principles will be upheld: all code on GitHub, data in Zenodo, and workflows in Jupyter notebooks. Trainees (5 graduate students, 3 postdocs) will gain hands-on experience through paired mentoring and hackathons, building data-savvy skills. Potential risks, like data incompatibility, will be mitigated by adaptive curation strategies.

Overall, this rigorous, collaborative method will yield innovative strategies for synthesizing stem cell data, advancing emergence research in molecular biosciences. (852 words)

Biophysicists, AI specialists collaborate, using NCEMS for simulations. Open resources will solve condensate puzzles and train innovators.",,"Background And Significance

Biomolecular condensates represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular organization, challenging the traditional view of membrane-bound compartments as the sole means of spatial compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells. These membraneless organelles, formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), enable the dynamic assembly of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules into functional hubs that regulate diverse cellular processes such as gene expression, signal transduction, and stress responses. The concept of LLPS in biology gained prominence with seminal works in the early 2010s, including studies by Brangwynne et al. (2009) on P granules in C. elegans, which demonstrated that these structures behave like liquid droplets, capable of fusion and fission. Subsequent research expanded this to include nucleoli, stress granules, and membraneless organelles in synapses, highlighting their ubiquity across cellular contexts.

The current state of the field is characterized by rapid accumulation of data from high-throughput techniques. Public repositories such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), BioGRID for interaction networks, and databases like PhaSePro and LLPSDB curate extensive information on proteins prone to phase separation, including intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), multivalent interactions, and environmental triggers like pH and temperature. Advances in imaging technologies, such as super-resolution microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, have provided visual evidence of condensate dynamics, while biophysical models, including those based on polymer physics and mean-field theories, attempt to predict phase behavior. For instance, Hyman and colleagues (2014) proposed frameworks linking molecular valency to droplet formation, and computational simulations by Pappu et al. (2018) have modeled sticker-and-spacer architectures in IDRs.

Despite these advancements, significant gaps persist. First, the emergent properties of condensates—how microscopic molecular interactions give rise to macroscopic cellular organization—remain poorly understood. Most studies focus on individual condensates or specific proteins, leading to fragmented insights. For example, while we know that RNA-binding proteins like FUS and TDP-43 form pathological aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases, integrating data across scales (from atomic interactions to cellular phenotypes) is lacking. Second, predictive models are limited by the heterogeneity of datasets: structural data from PDB often lack dynamic information, while proteomic datasets from mass spectrometry provide abundance but not spatial context. This silos knowledge, preventing a holistic view of how condensates contribute to cellular emergence phenomena, such as self-organization and adaptability.

Limitations in current approaches exacerbate these gaps. Individual labs typically handle small-scale analyses, but synthesizing vast, disparate datasets requires computational power and interdisciplinary expertise beyond most single groups. Traditional experimental methods generate new data but overlook the wealth of existing public resources, leading to redundancy. Moreover, the field suffers from reproducibility issues, with varying definitions of phase separation criteria across studies. The timeliness of this research is underscored by recent global health challenges, such as the role of condensates in viral replication (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein forming condensates) and neurodegeneration, where aberrant LLPS contributes to diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's. The explosion of AI tools offers unprecedented opportunities for data integration, as seen in AlphaFold's success in protein structure prediction, yet their application to condensate synthesis is underexplored.

This project is important because it addresses fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences: how do emergent phenomena arise from biomolecular interactions? By synthesizing publicly available data, we can uncover patterns invisible to siloed analyses, such as universal principles governing condensate formation across cell types. This aligns with NCEMS's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams for data-driven insights, fostering collaborations between biophysicists and AI specialists to model complex systems. The significance extends to therapeutic applications; understanding condensate dynamics could lead to interventions for condensate-related pathologies. Furthermore, in an era of big data, this work promotes open science, training a data-savvy workforce and democratizing access to advanced analytical strategies. Without such synthesis, long-standing puzzles—like the role of condensates in evolutionary adaptation or cellular memory—will remain unsolved, hindering progress in synthetic biology and personalized medicine. By leveraging existing data collaboratively, this proposal promises to bridge gaps, providing deeper insights into cellular emergence and setting a precedent for transdisciplinary research.

In summary, the field of biomolecular condensates is at a crossroads, with abundant data but insufficient integration. This research is timely, as AI advancements enable novel syntheses, and crucial for advancing molecular sciences through emergent understanding. (Word count: 712)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project aims to address compelling scientific questions in molecular and cellular biology by synthesizing publicly available data on biomolecular condensates, focusing on emergent phenomena arising from phase separation. We pose three specific, interconnected research questions that build upon identified gaps in the field, ensuring a focused yet comprehensive approach. These questions are designed to be tackled through a collaborative, transdisciplinary working group, leveraging diverse expertise to integrate datasets and develop predictive models.

Research Question 1: What are the universal molecular determinants that drive the formation and dissolution of biomolecular condensates across different cellular contexts? This question seeks to identify patterns in protein sequences, interaction networks, and environmental factors that consistently predict phase behavior, moving beyond case-specific studies to generalizable principles. We hypothesize that multivalent interactions, particularly those involving IDRs with sticker-spacer motifs, serve as primary drivers of condensate emergence, with RNA molecules acting as tunable scaffolds. Specifically, we predict that in datasets from diverse organisms (e.g., yeast to human cells), condensates will exhibit a threshold valency of at least three interaction sites per protein, and that perturbations in ionic strength or pH will correlate with dissolution rates, testable by meta-analysis of proteomic and structural data.

Research Question 2: How do emergent properties of condensates, such as viscoelasticity and compartmentalization, influence cellular organization and function at a systems level? Here, we explore how microscopic interactions scale to macroscopic outcomes, such as signaling efficiency or stress response. Our hypothesis posits that condensate viscoelasticity, modeled as a function of protein density and cross-linking, enhances reaction rates in crowded cellular environments by 20-50% compared to diffuse states, as evidenced by integrated simulation data. We predict that in disease models (e.g., ALS-associated aggregates), reduced fluidity will correlate with impaired cellular functions like mRNA processing, validated through comparative analyses of wild-type versus mutant datasets.

Research Question 3: Can AI-driven models accurately predict novel condensate behaviors by integrating heterogeneous public datasets, and what methodological innovations are needed to improve prediction accuracy? This question targets the development of analytical strategies, addressing the limitation of current models in handling data diversity. We hypothesize that hybrid AI approaches, combining graph neural networks (GNNs) for interaction mapping and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for simulation, will achieve prediction accuracies exceeding 85% for condensate formation, outperforming traditional biophysical models. Predictions include identifying novel phase-separating proteins in understudied genomes, with validation against independent datasets.

These hypotheses are testable using synthesis methods without generating new data. For RQ1, we will employ statistical meta-analysis and machine learning clustering on datasets from PDB and PhaSePro to test valency thresholds, expecting deliverables like a curated database of universal determinants. For RQ2, agent-based simulations will validate viscoelasticity impacts, yielding predictive models of cellular organization. For RQ3, iterative AI training and cross-validation will refine methods, producing open-source tools. Expected outcomes include peer-reviewed publications on emergent principles, a public repository of integrated data, and training modules for trainees. Validation will involve rigorous benchmarking: hypotheses will be falsified if predictions fail to align with held-out data subsets (e.g., 20% test sets), using metrics like area under the ROC curve for accuracy.

Overall, these questions and hypotheses drive novel insights into emergence in biosciences, solving puzzles like the evolutionary conservation of LLPS. By focusing on testable predictions, the project ensures scientific rigor, with deliverables such as synthesized datasets, AI models, and collaborative frameworks that advance the field and train future researchers in data synthesis.

Additional sources include UniProt for sequence annotations and PubChem for small-molecule interactions affecting phase behavior. Data integration will use ontologies like Gene Ontology (GO) to harmonize terms, ensuring compatibility across datasets from yeast, Drosophila, and human models.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: The core methodology involves AI-enhanced synthesis. First, data preprocessing will employ Python-based tools (e.g., Pandas, Biopython) to clean and normalize datasets, handling missing values via imputation and standardizing formats. For RQ1, we will apply unsupervised machine learning (e.g., k-means clustering) to identify molecular determinants, followed by graph theory analysis using NetworkX to map multivalent interactions. Hypotheses will be tested via statistical correlations (Pearson’s r) between valency and phase propensity.

For RQ2, we will develop agent-based models using Mesa framework to simulate condensate dynamics, incorporating viscoelastic parameters from polymer physics equations (e.g., Flory-Huggins theory). Inputs from integrated datasets will parameterize models, predicting emergent properties like diffusion rates. AI integration via graph neural networks (GNNs, implemented in PyTorch Geometric) will learn interaction patterns, while generative models (GANs) will simulate unobserved scenarios, such as condensate responses to hypothetical perturbations.

For RQ3, hybrid AI pipelines will be built: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sequence-based predictions, combined with reinforcement learning to optimize model parameters. Methodological innovations include a novel ensemble method fusing GNNs and GANs for multi-scale modeling, addressing data heterogeneity. All models will be trained on cloud platforms (e.g., Google Colab with GPU access) to handle large datasets.

Experimental Design: Though no wet-lab experiments, the design mimics rigorous controls. We will use stratified sampling to create training/validation/test splits (70/15/15), with controls via null models (randomized interactions) to benchmark predictions. Replicates will involve multiple runs (n=10) with varied seeds for robustness. Sensitivity analyses will test parameter variations, ensuring reproducibility.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and integration (Milestone: Curated database released on Zenodo). Initial clustering and GNN training (Deliverable: Preliminary models and progress report). Year 2 (Months 13-24): Advanced simulations and hypothesis testing (Milestone: Validated predictions for RQ1 and RQ2; open-source code repository). Trainee-led workshops on AI tools. Year 3 (Months 25-36): Method refinement, full validation, and synthesis of findings (Milestone: Comprehensive AI framework; final deliverables including manuscripts and training modules). Quarterly virtual meetings and two annual in-person workshops will facilitate collaboration.

Statistical Analysis Plans: For hypothesis testing, we will use ANOVA for group comparisons (e.g., valency thresholds), regression models for predictions (e.g., logistic regression for phase propensity), and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon) for non-normal data. Accuracy metrics include precision-recall curves and F1-scores, with p<0.05 significance via Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. Power analyses will ensure sufficient dataset sizes for 80% power.

This approach requires NCEMS support for computational resources and coordination, exceeding single-lab capabilities, and promotes diverse partnerships across career stages and geographies. (Word count: 852)

We hypothesize that specific immune cell subsets play critical roles in tumor suppression through mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, and modulation of the TME. Conversely, we predict that certain immune cell subsets promote tumor growth through immunosuppressive activities. To test these hypotheses, we will identify and characterize distinct immune cell populations using clustering algorithms and gene expression signatures. We expect to discover novel immune cell subsets and their functions in the TME, which could lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

The field of epigenetics has seen remarkable advancements over the past decades, revealing how gene expression can be regulated without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) refers to the transmission of epigenetic marks across generations, which can influence phenotype without changes to the genome itself. While TEI has been observed in various organisms, including plants, animals, and even humans, our understanding of its mechanisms and implications remains limited. Current studies often focus on single species or specific environmental conditions, leading to fragmented and incomplete knowledge. For instance, while numerous studies have demonstrated TEI in Arabidopsis thaliana, the mechanisms and heritability of these epigenetic marks across multiple generations are still under investigation. Similarly, in mammals, the role of TEI in complex traits such as disease susceptibility and behavioral phenotypes is an emerging area of research but lacks a comprehensive framework. These gaps highlight the need for a systematic and interdisciplinary approach to synthesize existing data and uncover common patterns and mechanisms of TEI across diverse species. This project aims to fill these knowledge gaps by integrating epigenetic data from multiple species, thereby providing a more holistic view of TEI and its potential biological significance. Given the rapid accumulation of epigenetic data, now is an opportune time to leverage these resources to address fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biology. Furthermore, the project's focus on data synthesis and integration aligns with the growing trend towards collaborative and multidisciplinary research, which is essential for addressing complex biological phenomena.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

To address the limitations in our current understanding of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, we propose the following specific research questions and testable hypotheses:

**Research Question 1:** What are the key epigenetic marks that are stably inherited across generations?

**Hypothesis 1:** DNA methylation and histone modifications are the primary epigenetic marks responsible for stable inheritance of traits.

**Research Question 2:** How do environmental factors influence the establishment and maintenance of heritable epigenetic marks?

**Hypothesis 2:** Environmental stressors such as temperature fluctuations, nutrient availability, and chemical exposures can trigger or modify heritable epigenetic marks.

**Research Question 3:** Can heritable epigenetic marks influence complex phenotypes such as behavior, disease susceptibility, and developmental traits?

**Hypothesis 3:** Heritable epigenetic marks can contribute to the development of complex phenotypes, potentially influencing disease susceptibility and behavioral traits.

**Expected Outcomes and Deliverables:**

- Identification of conserved and species-specific heritable epigenetic marks.
- Development of predictive models linking environmental factors to heritable epigenetic marks.
- Insights into the mechanisms underlying transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in different species.
- Publication of findings in high-impact, open-access journals.
- Training of graduate students and postdocs in advanced epigenetic techniques and data analysis.

Methods And Approach

We will synthesize epigenetic datasets from diverse species, including model organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and Mus musculus, as well as non-model organisms such as C. elegans and human cell lines. The datasets will include DNA methylation profiles, histone modification maps, and RNA-seq data from multiple generations. We will use publicly available databases such as ENCODE, modENCODE, and the Epigenomics Roadmap to gather these data.

**Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches:**

- **Data Integration:** We will employ integrative genomic analysis tools to combine DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA-seq data. Specifically, we will use methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and machine learning algorithms to identify co-regulated epigenetic marks.
- **Heritability Analysis:** To assess the stability and heritability of epigenetic marks, we will apply statistical methods such as linear mixed-effects models and principal component analysis (PCA).
- **Environmental Influence Analysis:** We will use functional enrichment analysis and correlation networks to determine the impact of environmental factors on epigenetic marks.

**Experimental Design:** Since this is a data synthesis project, there will be no new experimental data generation. However, we will validate our findings using existing experimental data where possible. Controls will be established by comparing epigenetic profiles between different generations and under varying environmental conditions. Replicates will be included in the analysis to ensure robustness.

**Timeline and Milestones:**

- **Month 1-3:** Data collection and integration
- **Month 4-6:** Heritability analysis and initial model development
- **Month 7-9:** Environmental influence analysis and model refinement
- **Month 10-12:** Validation and publication preparation

**Statistical Analysis Plans:** We will use appropriate statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to validate our hypotheses. All analyses will be performed using software such as R and Python, and results will be visualized using tools like ggplot2 and seaborn.

Neurodevelopmental disorders and their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood despite decades of research. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have provided unprecedented insights into brain structure and function. Simultaneously, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the generation of vast genomic datasets, offering the potential to identify genetic variants linked to neurological conditions. However, the integration of these diverse data types remains challenging due to the complex nature of brain development and the heterogeneity of neurological disorders. Current studies often focus on single data types or small cohorts, limiting our understanding of the interplay between genetics and environment in brain development. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach to synthesize these datasets and provide a more holistic view of neurodevelopmental processes and disorders. This project aims to fill this gap by leveraging publicly available neuroimaging and genomic data to identify genetic and environmental factors influencing brain development across different stages and disorders. Such an endeavor is crucial for advancing our understanding of neurological conditions, improving diagnostic tools, and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Given the complexity of the problem and the need for diverse expertise, this project aligns perfectly with the goals of the NCEMS to catalyze community-scale synthesis and integration of existing data.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

Our primary research question is: What genetic and environmental factors influence brain development and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders? Specifically, we hypothesize that: 1) Genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are significantly associated with differences in brain structure and function as measured by neuroimaging techniques. 2) Environmental factors, including maternal health during pregnancy and early life experiences, modulate the expression of these genetic variants and impact brain development. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a series of analyses, including correlation studies between genomic and neuroimaging data, epigenetic modifications, and gene-environment interactions. We predict that our findings will provide novel insights into the genetic and environmental factors that influence brain development and contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. These results are expected to inform future research directions and lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive database of genetic and environmental factors associated with brain development, a set of integrative models that can predict brain structure and function based on genetic and environmental inputs, and a set of guidelines for the ethical use of genomic and neuroimaging data in clinical settings. These outcomes will be validated through rigorous statistical analyses and cross-verification with independent datasets.

We will leverage publicly available neuroimaging and genomic datasets from various developmental stages and neurological disorders. Specifically, we will use the ADHD200 dataset for ADHD, the ENIGMA consortium for various psychiatric disorders, and the Human Connectome Project for healthy brain development. These datasets will be integrated using advanced computational techniques, including machine learning algorithms and network analysis, to identify genetic variants associated with brain structure and function. We will employ a variety of statistical methods, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and mixed-effects models, to analyze the relationships between genomic and neuroimaging data. Additionally, we will perform pathway and network analyses to understand the biological pathways and networks that are perturbed in neurodevelopmental disorders. To ensure the reliability and reproducibility of our findings, we will implement best practices in data management and analysis, including version control, documentation, and peer review. The project will be divided into several phases, each with specific deliverables and timelines. Phase 1 will involve data curation and quality control, which will take approximately 6 months. Phase 2 will focus on data integration and preliminary analyses, lasting 12 months. Phase 3 will involve the development of integrative models and validation, taking 18 months. Throughout the project, we will hold regular meetings and workshops to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members. We will also engage with external experts and stakeholders to ensure the relevance and impact of our findings. The project timeline is as follows: Data curation and quality control (6 months); Data integration and preliminary analyses (12 months); Development of integrative models and validation (18 months); Dissemination and training (12 months).

Understanding how plants respond to environmental stresses such as drought, heat, and pathogens is crucial for improving crop resilience and food security. Current research primarily focuses on individual omics layers (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), but integrating these layers can provide a more holistic view of stress response mechanisms. Despite advances in omics technologies, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how these different layers interact during stress responses. For instance, while transcriptomics can indicate which genes are upregulated or downregulated, proteomics can reveal the actual protein abundance and modifications, and metabolomics can show changes in small molecule concentrations. Integrating these data can help us understand the functional relationships between these layers and identify key regulatory pathways. Additionally, recent technological advancements have enabled high-throughput omics data generation, but the lack of standardized methods for data integration hinders our ability to draw meaningful conclusions. This project aims to fill this gap by synthesizing existing omics data to uncover novel insights into plant stress responses. Given the complexity and scale of the task, a multidisciplinary approach involving plant biologists, biochemists, and computational biologists is essential. NCEMS support will be critical for handling large-scale datasets and performing advanced analyses.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

Our primary research question is: What are the integrated molecular mechanisms underlying plant stress responses? To address this, we will formulate the following testable hypotheses:

H1: Transcriptomic data will show upregulation of certain gene families (e.g., heat shock proteins, transcription factors) in response to heat stress.

H2: Proteomic data will reveal increased abundance of stress-related proteins (e.g., chaperones, dehydrins) in stressed plants compared to unstressed controls.

H3: Metabolomic data will indicate changes in secondary metabolites (e.g., flavonoids, phenolic acids) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.

H4: Integrative analysis of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data will identify co-regulated gene-protein-metabolite modules that are key to stress response pathways.

We expect that these hypotheses will be supported by the data, leading to the identification of key regulatory networks and potential biomarkers for stress response. These findings could have significant implications for developing stress-tolerant crops and improving our understanding of plant stress physiology.

Methods And Approach

We will synthesize plant omics datasets from publicly available repositories such as NCBI, EMBL-EBI, and Plant Metabolomics Database. These datasets will cover multiple stress conditions including drought, heat, and pathogen infection. We will use advanced bioinformatics tools and machine learning algorithms to integrate and analyze these datasets. Specifically, we will employ differential expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes, proteins, and metabolites across stress conditions. Functional enrichment analysis will be performed to understand the biological processes and pathways involved in stress responses. Network analysis will be used to identify co-regulated modules and potential regulatory hubs. We will validate our findings using orthogonal experimental methods where possible, such as qPCR for gene expression validation and mass spectrometry for protein quantification. The project will be divided into several phases, each with specific deliverables and milestones. Phase 1 will involve data collection and quality control, Phase 2 will focus on data integration and preliminary analysis, and Phase 3 will involve model development and hypothesis testing.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The expected outcomes of this project include the identification of key stress-responsive genes, proteins, and metabolites, as well as the development of integrative models that can predict plant stress responses. These findings could lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers for stress tolerance and inform breeding programs aimed at developing stress-resistant crops. Moreover, the project will contribute to the broader field of plant stress physiology by providing a framework for integrating omics data. The project will also promote cross-disciplinary collaboration among plant biologists, biochemists, and computational biologists, fostering innovation and skill development.

The gut-brain axis represents a complex network of bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS), enteric nervous system (ENS), and the intestinal microbiota. This axis plays a critical role in modulating cognitive functions, mood, and behavior. Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbiota composition can impact brain function and contribute to various neurological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain poorly understood. Current research predominantly relies on animal models and small-scale human studies, which limit our ability to draw robust conclusions due to variability and confounding factors.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

Our primary research question is: What are the key bacterial species and their metabolites that influence brain function via the gut-brain axis? To address this question, we propose the following testable hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Specific bacterial species in the gut microbiota produce metabolites that modulate the expression of genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling pathways in the brain. Hypothesis 2: Alterations in the gut microbiota composition can lead to changes in fecal metabolite profiles, which in turn affect brain function and behavior.

Normalization will be performed using standardized methods to ensure consistency across datasets. Integration will involve combining the curated and normalized datasets into a unified framework for analysis. Computational approaches will include pathway enrichment analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning algorithms to identify key bacterial species and metabolites that influence brain function. Specifically, we will use differential expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in response to alterations in gut microbiota composition. Pathway enrichment analysis will help us understand the biological processes and signaling pathways affected by these changes. Correlation analysis will be used to identify associations between gut microbiota composition, fecal metabolites, and host transcriptomic profiles.

Despite its importance, a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of the molecular principles governing entry into, maintenance of, and exit from quiescence is lacking. This project proposes to establish a multidisciplinary working group to synthesize the vast and growing body of publicly available multi-omics data related to quiescence. We will integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic datasets from diverse biological contexts, including yeast, cultured mammalian cells, primary stem cells, and dormant tumor cells. The central hypothesis is that a conserved 'core quiescence program' exists across species and cell types, which is then tailored by context-specific regulatory modules. The working group, comprising experts in cell cycle biology, systems biology, computational modeling, and machine learning, will develop a novel analytical pipeline to normalize and integrate these heterogeneous datasets. Our primary goals are to: 1) Identify a robust, cross-species molecular signature of the core quiescence program; 2) Map the signaling pathways and metabolic shifts that are universally associated with the quiescent state; and 3) Build predictive models that can distinguish between different 'depths' of quiescence and predict a cell's potential to re-enter the cell cycle. This project will produce a comprehensive 'Quiescence Atlas,' a valuable community resource that will illuminate a fundamental emergent state of cellular life and provide novel insights into aging and disease.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular quiescence, or G0, is a state of reversible cell cycle arrest that is fundamental to the biology of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Unlike terminal differentiation or senescence, which represent permanent exits from the cell cycle, quiescence is a dynamic and actively maintained state from which cells can re-enter proliferation in response to appropriate stimuli. This cellular state is not a passive default but an intricate program essential for tissue homeostasis, adult stem cell maintenance, immune memory, and organismal longevity. Dysregulation of quiescence is a hallmark of numerous diseases, including cancer, where dormant tumor cells evade therapy and drive relapse, and aging, which is associated with a decline in the regenerative capacity of quiescent stem cell pools. The current understanding of quiescence has evolved significantly. Initially viewed as a simple absence of proliferation, it is now recognized as a collection of heterogeneous, actively regulated states. Seminal work in model systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) under nutrient limitation, mammalian fibroblasts subjected to serum starvation or contact inhibition, and primary adult stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, HSCs) has revealed key features of the quiescent state. These include profound metabolic reprogramming, characterized by a shift from anabolic to catabolic processes, reduced global transcription and translation, and the establishment of a unique chromatin landscape. Key signaling pathways, most notably the mTOR and insulin/IGF-1 pathways, are known to be major regulators of the quiescence-proliferation decision. However, our knowledge remains remarkably fragmented. The vast majority of studies have focused on a single model system, a specific method of quiescence induction, and often a single omics modality (e.g., transcriptomics). For instance, transcriptomic studies have identified signatures associated with quiescence in HSCs, revealing the importance of transcription factors like FOXO3 and HES1. Proteomic analyses in yeast have highlighted the importance of proteasome remodeling and selective protein synthesis. Similarly, metabolic studies have shown a reliance on fatty acid oxidation in quiescent stem cells. While these individual studies have been invaluable, they have created a collection of context-specific observations without a unifying framework. This fragmentation represents a major gap in the field. There is no consensus on whether a 'core' quiescence program exists that is conserved across the vast evolutionary distance between yeast and humans, and across functionally distinct cell types like a fibroblast and a hematopoietic stem cell. We lack a systems-level, integrated view of how the genome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome are coordinately rewired to establish and maintain this dormant state. Furthermore, the concept of quiescence 'depth'—the idea that some cells are more deeply quiescent and require a stronger stimulus to reactivate—is well-recognized biologically but lacks a quantitative molecular definition. This research is both important and timely due to two converging factors: the explosion of publicly available multi-omics data and the maturation of computational tools for data integration. Repositories like GEO, SRA, and PRIDE now house thousands of datasets relevant to quiescence, a resource far too vast for any single lab to analyze. This proposal outlines a community-scale synthesis project that will leverage this data deluge to address these fundamental gaps. By forming a multidisciplinary working group of cell biologists, systems biologists, and computational scientists, we will perform the first-ever systematic, cross-species, multi-omic integration of quiescence data. This project is perfectly aligned with the research call's mission to synthesize public data to solve long-standing puzzles in molecular and cellular sciences, an endeavor that requires the diverse expertise and collaborative scale that NCEMS is uniquely positioned to support. The outcome will be a universal definition of cellular dormancy, providing transformative insights into fundamental biology and human disease.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research is driven by the central hypothesis that a conserved, universal 'core quiescence program' exists across eukaryotic species and diverse cell types, which is modulated by context-specific regulatory layers to control the entry, maintenance, and depth of the dormant state. To systematically test this overarching hypothesis, we have formulated three specific research questions, each with associated testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes. 

**Research Question 1: What are the conserved molecular features that define a universal core quiescence program at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels?**
This question addresses the fundamental need for a robust, molecular definition of quiescence that transcends specific biological contexts. 
*   **Hypothesis 1a (Conserved Transcriptional Signature):** We hypothesize that a set of orthologous genes exhibits a consistent pattern of differential expression (up- or down-regulation) in quiescent versus proliferative cells across all studied species and cell types. This signature will reflect the fundamental requirements of dormancy, such as cell cycle arrest, reduced biosynthesis, and enhanced cellular maintenance and stress resistance.
    *   **Prediction:** A cross-species meta-analysis of transcriptomic datasets will identify a statistically robust gene set whose members are consistently associated with the quiescent state. We predict this set will be enriched for genes involved in cell cycle inhibition (e.g., CDK inhibitors), autophagy, DNA repair, and antioxidant defense, while genes related to ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and glycolysis will be repressed.
*   **Hypothesis 1b (Conserved Epigenomic Architecture):** We hypothesize that the core quiescence program is underpinned by a conserved chromatin state characterized by global condensation to reduce transcriptional noise, coupled with specific 'poised' domains at key developmental and cell cycle re-entry genes, allowing for rapid reactivation.
    *   **Prediction:** Integrated analysis of public ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data will reveal common patterns, such as decreased accessibility at promoters of proliferative genes and the maintenance or establishment of bivalent chromatin domains (co-occurrence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) at the promoters of lineage-specifying transcription factors in stem cells.

**Research Question 2: Which signaling and metabolic pathways are universally rewired to establish and maintain the quiescent state?**
This question aims to move beyond a list of genes to a functional, systems-level understanding of the regulatory logic of quiescence.
*   **Hypothesis 2a (Universal Signaling Hubs):** We hypothesize that a small number of key signaling pathways, including mTORC1, Ras/MAPK, and Insulin/IGF-1, act as conserved master integrators of extracellular and intracellular cues to universally control the quiescence-proliferation decision.
    *   **Prediction:** Integrated analysis of phosphoproteomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data will demonstrate consistent down-regulation of the activity of these pathways in quiescent cells across all contexts. We will identify a core set of downstream phosphorylation targets and transcriptional effectors that are universally regulated by these hubs.
*   **Hypothesis 2b (Conserved Metabolic Reprogramming):** We hypothesize that quiescent cells universally adopt a catabolic metabolic state to ensure long-term survival, characterized by suppressed anabolic pathways (e.g., glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis) and an increased reliance on catabolic processes (e.g., autophagy, fatty acid oxidation) for energy production and cellular maintenance.
    *   **Prediction:** Meta-analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data will reveal conserved shifts, including decreased levels of glycolytic intermediates and TCA cycle anaplerotic substrates, and increased expression of genes involved in autophagy (e.g., ATG genes) and fatty acid beta-oxidation (e.g., CPT1).

**Research Question 3: Can a quantitative, multi-omic signature distinguish different 'depths' of quiescence and predict a cell's potential for reactivation?**
This question seeks to develop a predictive framework for the functional heterogeneity observed within quiescent populations.
*   **Hypothesis 3a (Molecular Determinants of Depth):** We hypothesize that the functional depth of quiescence is encoded by a quantitative molecular signature. This signature is not binary but continuous, reflecting graded changes in the abundance of specific cell cycle inhibitors, the degree of chromatin compaction, and the levels of key metabolic enzymes and stored macromolecules.
    *   **Prediction:** A supervised machine learning model trained on multi-omics data from systems with defined quiescence depths (e.g., short-term vs. long-term starvation; HSCs vs. multipotent progenitors) will be able to accurately predict the reactivation potential of cells from independent datasets. We predict that features such as the expression ratio of CDK inhibitors to cyclins, chromatin accessibility at cell cycle gene promoters, and levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins will be highly predictive.

**Validation and Deliverables:** The hypotheses will be tested through rigorous statistical meta-analysis and validated by assessing the performance of predictive models on held-out, independent datasets. The primary deliverables will be: (1) A validated list of core quiescence genes, proteins, and metabolites; (2) A comprehensive map of the conserved signaling and metabolic networks of quiescence; (3) A robust, validated computational model for predicting quiescence depth; and (4) The 'Quiescence Atlas,' a public web portal integrating all data, models, and visualizations as a lasting community resource.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed in four integrated phases by a multidisciplinary working group with expertise in cell cycle biology (PI 1), stem cell and cancer dormancy (PI 2), systems biology and data integration (PI 3), and machine learning (PI 4). The collaborative framework will involve bi-weekly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops, and the use of shared platforms like GitHub, Slack, and a common cloud computing environment to ensure seamless integration and cross-pollination of ideas and skills.

**Phase 1: Systematic Data Curation and Harmonization Pipeline Development (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase is critical for ensuring the rigor and reproducibility of our synthesis. The goal is to create a comprehensive, consistently processed, and well-annotated multi-omic dataset of quiescence.
*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), ArrayExpress, PRIDE, MassIVE, and the Metabolomics Workbench. Search terms will include 'quiescence', 'G0', 'dormancy', 'serum starvation', 'contact inhibition', and specific quiescent cell types (e.g., 'hematopoietic stem cell').
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** Datasets will be included based on strict criteria: (1) must contain both a quiescent and a corresponding proliferative control sample; (2) must have sufficient biological replicates (n≥2); (3) must have detailed, parsable metadata on species, cell type, quiescence induction method, and duration; (4) must pass initial quality control checks.
*   **Data Types:** We will target datasets across four omics layers: transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq), epigenomics (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3), proteomics (quantitative mass spectrometry, phosphoproteomics), and metabolomics (LC-MS, GC-MS).
*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** A key innovation of this project is the development of a standardized computational pipeline to mitigate technical variability. Raw data (e.g., FASTQ, .raw files) will be uniformly reprocessed using community-standard, containerized workflows (e.g., nf-core pipelines for genomics, MaxQuant for proteomics). This eliminates variability from different primary analysis software and parameters. Metadata will be standardized using controlled vocabularies. For cross-species analysis, human, mouse, and yeast genes/proteins will be mapped to ortholog groups using the Ensembl Compara database. Finally, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq, Harmony) to the processed data to remove study-specific technical effects while preserving the biological signal of quiescence.

**Phase 2: Integrative Analysis to Define the Core Quiescence Program (Months 10-24)**
With the harmonized data, we will address our first two research questions.
*   **Aim 1 (Molecular Signature):** To identify the core transcriptional signature, we will first perform differential expression analysis within each dataset. We will then use robust meta-analysis methods (e.g., Rank Product, fixed and random-effects models) to combine effect sizes and p-values across all datasets and species, identifying genes with consistent changes. For multi-omic integration, we will use unsupervised methods like Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA+) or weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) applied to the combined data matrix to identify co-regulated modules of genes, proteins, and accessible chromatin regions that define quiescence.
*   **Aim 2 (Pathway and Network Analysis):** The identified core signatures will be subjected to pathway enrichment analysis (e.g., GSEA, ReactomePA) to pinpoint conserved biological processes. To understand the regulatory logic, we will construct a multi-layer network by integrating our findings with public protein-protein interaction (STRING), kinase-substrate (PhosphoSitePlus), and metabolic pathway (KEGG, Recon3D) databases. Network topology analysis will be used to identify key hub proteins and regulatory nodes that orchestrate the quiescent state.

**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling of Quiescence Depth (Months 18-30)**
This phase focuses on developing a quantitative, predictive understanding of quiescence heterogeneity.
*   **Model Training:** We will curate a specific training dataset where quiescence 'depth' can be assigned a semi-quantitative label based on metadata (e.g., 1=short-term starvation, 2=long-term starvation, 3=primary HSCs). Using the harmonized multi-omic data as features, we will train a suite of supervised machine learning models (e.g., Elastic Net regression, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests) to predict this depth score. Feature selection techniques will be employed to identify the most informative molecular predictors.
*   **Model Validation:** The model's performance will be rigorously assessed using cross-validation and testing on completely held-out datasets. We will further validate its biological relevance by correlating the predicted depth score with experimental readouts from the literature, such as the time required for cell cycle re-entry or colony-forming ability, which were not used during training.

**Phase 4: Dissemination via the 'Quiescence Atlas' (Months 24-36)**
To ensure maximum impact and adherence to open science principles, all findings will be disseminated through a public web portal.
*   **Atlas Development:** We will build a user-friendly web application using frameworks like R Shiny or Dash. The Atlas will allow users to search, browse, and visualize all curated and processed data. It will feature interactive tools to explore the core quiescence signature, query the multi-layer network, and use our predictive model to score new user-supplied data.
*   **Open Science:** All analysis code and workflows will be version-controlled on GitHub and documented for reproducibility. All harmonized data matrices and model objects will be deposited in Zenodo. This ensures our entire research process is transparent, reproducible, and reusable by the broader community.

**Timeline & Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data curation and the harmonization pipeline (M1); preliminary identification of the core transcriptional signature.
*   **Year 2:** Completion of multi-omic integration and network analysis (M2); development and initial validation of the quiescence depth model.
*   **Year 3:** Final model refinement and external validation; public launch of the Quiescence Atlas (M3); submission of the primary manuscript.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce transformative outcomes that will reshape our understanding of cellular quiescence, with significant and lasting impacts on both fundamental biology and translational research. The synthesis-driven approach will generate novel insights and resources that are unattainable by individual research labs.

**Expected Outcomes and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **The First Unified, Multi-Omic Definition of Quiescence:** The primary outcome will be the identification and rigorous validation of a 'core quiescence program'—a conserved molecular signature of genes, proteins, epigenetic marks, and metabolic states that defines cellular dormancy across species and cell types. This will shift the paradigm from a collection of disparate, context-dependent descriptions to a fundamental, systems-level definition. This foundational knowledge will provide a common framework for the entire field, enabling researchers to compare results from different systems in a standardized way.
2.  **A Comprehensive Map of Quiescence Regulation:** We will deliver a detailed map of the conserved signaling and metabolic networks that govern the entry into, maintenance of, and exit from quiescence. This network model will illuminate the hierarchical control structures and feedback loops, identifying universal master regulators and critical nodes. This will generate a wealth of specific, testable hypotheses for the experimental community to pursue, driving the field forward for years to come.
3.  **A Novel Predictive Tool for Quiescence Depth:** Our machine learning model for predicting quiescence 'depth' will be a significant conceptual and practical advance. It will provide the first quantitative, molecularly-based tool to measure a critical biological property that has, until now, been only qualitatively described. This tool will allow researchers to stratify quiescent cell populations, predict their regenerative potential, and understand the molecular basis of functional heterogeneity.
4.  **The 'Quiescence Atlas': A Lasting Community Resource:** A major deliverable is the creation of the Quiescence Atlas, a public, interactive web portal. This resource will democratize access to the vast, integrated dataset we assemble. It will serve as a central hub for the quiescence research community, enabling hypothesis generation, data exploration, and re-analysis. By adhering to FAIR data principles, the Atlas will be a durable and invaluable asset that lowers the barrier to entry for data-driven research in this area.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The fundamental insights generated will have far-reaching implications for human health.
*   **Oncology:** Dormant cancer cells are a primary driver of therapeutic resistance and metastatic relapse. Our core signature and depth model could lead to biomarkers to identify these dangerous cells and reveal novel therapeutic targets within the conserved maintenance pathways to eradicate them.
*   **Regenerative Medicine:** The ability to control stem cell quiescence is paramount for therapies involving cell transplantation and tissue engineering. Our findings could inform protocols to maintain stem cells in a potent, deeply quiescent state during ex vivo culture or to precisely control their activation for enhanced tissue repair.
*   **Aging:** The age-related decline in tissue function is linked to both stem cell exhaustion and the accumulation of senescent cells. Our work will provide clear molecular discriminators between functional quiescence and irreversible senescence, helping to elucidate the mechanisms of aging and potentially suggesting interventions to preserve regenerative capacity.

**Dissemination, Training, and Collaboration:**
Our dissemination strategy is multifaceted. We will publish our main findings in a high-impact, open-access journal. We will present our work at key international conferences to engage with the scientific community. Crucially, the Quiescence Atlas itself is a primary tool for dissemination. In line with the research call's goals, this project is an ideal training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs will gain unique, cross-disciplinary skills in big data analysis, systems biology, and open science practices, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy workforce. We will host workshops to train the broader community on our analytical pipelines and the use of the Atlas. The working group structure will forge lasting collaborations among the participating labs, and the Atlas will serve as a catalyst for new collaborations between computational and experimental researchers across the globe. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to become a community-maintained and -expanded resource, with a sustainability plan involving follow-on funding to incorporate new data types and cellular states, ensuring its enduring impact on the molecular and cellular sciences.

Budget And Resources

The total requested budget for this three-year project is $1,195,000. This budget is essential to support the personnel, collaborative activities, and computational infrastructure required for a community-scale synthesis project of this magnitude. The proposed work is beyond the capabilities of a single research lab, necessitating the NCEMS working group model to bring together the required diverse expertise and dedicated effort for large-scale data integration and analysis.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_02,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,A Multi-Modal Inference Engine for Elucidating the Function of Uncharacterized Human Proteins,"A significant fraction of the human proteome remains functionally unannotated, representing a major gap in our understanding of cellular biology. This project aims to systematically 'de-orphanize' these Proteins of Unknown Function (PUFs) by creating a powerful, integrative inference engine. This community-scale effort will synthesize diverse, publicly available data types at an unprecedented scale. The working group will integrate: 1) 3D structural predictions from the AlphaFold Database to identify distant homologies and functional domains; 2) Large-scale protein-protein interaction maps (e.g., BioGRID, STRING) to place PUFs within functional networks; 3) Co-expression data across thousands of tissues and cell types from GTEx and single-cell atlases to infer function via 'guilt-by-association'; 4) Phylogenetic profiles to identify patterns of conservation and co-evolution with known proteins; and 5) Phenotypic data from genome-wide screens (e.g., DepMap). This project requires a transdisciplinary team of structural biologists, bioinformaticians, network scientists, and machine learning experts. The team will develop a sophisticated Bayesian framework that weighs evidence from each data modality to assign a probabilistic functional annotation to each PUF. The final output will be a publicly accessible, dynamic web portal that provides high-confidence functional hypotheses for hundreds of PUFs, empowering the broader research community to accelerate experimental validation and uncover novel biological pathways.",,"Background And Significance

The completion of the Human Genome Project ushered in the post-genomic era, yet a fundamental challenge remains: a substantial portion of the human proteome is functionally uncharacterized. Despite decades of research, it is estimated that nearly one-third of the ~20,000 human proteins have poorly understood or completely unknown functions. These Proteins of Unknown Function (PUFs), often referred to as the 'dark proteome,' represent a major gap in our knowledge of human biology, hindering our ability to understand cellular networks, disease mechanisms, and to develop novel therapeutics. This proposal addresses this long-standing puzzle by synthesizing a diverse array of public data to systematically illuminate the functions of these enigmatic proteins.

Current approaches to protein function prediction have laid important groundwork but possess significant limitations. Traditional sequence-based methods, such as BLAST and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles from databases like Pfam, are powerful for identifying homologs but often fail for PUFs that lack conserved sequence motifs or belong to novel protein families. Structure-based methods, which infer function from 3D structural similarity, were historically limited by the slow pace of experimental structure determination. The recent revolution in protein structure prediction, spearheaded by AlphaFold2, has changed this landscape. The availability of high-quality predicted structures for the entire human proteome via the AlphaFold Database (AFDB) presents an unprecedented opportunity to identify distant evolutionary relationships and functional sites that are invisible at the sequence level. However, structure alone is often insufficient to pinpoint a protein's precise biological role.

To overcome this, researchers have turned to 'guilt-by-association' principles using systems-level data. Large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps from databases like BioGRID and STRING place proteins in the context of physical interaction networks, suggesting that interacting proteins often share functions. Similarly, co-expression networks, derived from massive transcriptomic datasets like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the Human Cell Atlas, link genes that are transcriptionally coordinated, often implying participation in the same pathway. Other powerful data types include phylogenetic profiling, which infers functional linkages from patterns of co-evolution across species, and large-scale phenotypic screens like the Dependency Map (DepMap), which reveal genes essential for cell survival under specific conditions. While several platforms, such as STRING and GeneMANIA, have successfully integrated some of these data types, they face key limitations. First, none have systematically incorporated the new wave of proteome-scale structural data from AlphaFold. Second, they often use heuristic scoring schemes, making it difficult to assess the statistical confidence of a prediction or to understand the contribution of individual evidence types. Finally, the sheer scale, heterogeneity, and rapid growth of these public datasets make their comprehensive integration a grand challenge that is beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory. This project is therefore both important and timely. It is important because de-orphanizing PUFs is critical for advancing fundamental biology and translational medicine. It is timely because the recent convergence of high-quality predicted structures, massive single-cell atlases, and comprehensive dependency maps provides the raw material for a transformative leap in functional genomics. By assembling a transdisciplinary working group to develop a rigorous, probabilistic framework for data synthesis, we can finally begin to systematically map the dark proteome and unlock its secrets.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to develop, validate, and deploy a multi-modal inference engine to systematically assign high-confidence functional annotations to uncharacterized human proteins. This community-scale effort is guided by a set of specific research questions and testable hypotheses designed to rigorously assess the power of data synthesis and generate novel biological insights.

**Primary Research Questions:**

*   **RQ1: The Synergy of Data Integration:** To what extent does the synergistic integration of predicted 3D structures, protein-protein interaction networks, tissue- and cell-type-specific co-expression profiles, phylogenetic patterns, and genome-wide phenotypic screens improve the accuracy, coverage, and specificity of functional predictions for human PUFs compared to any single-data-type approach or existing integrative methods?
*   **RQ2: A Probabilistic Framework for Evidence Synthesis:** How can a Bayesian statistical framework be optimally designed to quantitatively weigh evidence from fundamentally heterogeneous data sources? This involves learning the conditional probabilities of observing specific data features (e.g., a structural hit to a kinase domain, co-expression with cell cycle genes) given a specific function, thereby generating a unified, interpretable, and probabilistic functional annotation for each protein.
*   **RQ3: Discovery of Novel Biological Modules:** What novel biological pathways, protein complexes, and functional modules can be discovered by applying this integrative framework to systematically analyze PUFs in the context of the known proteome? Can we identify PUFs that act as 'missing links' connecting previously disparate cellular processes?
*   **RQ4: Prioritization for Experimental Validation:** Can our integrative approach effectively prioritize PUFs that are likely involved in critical cellular processes (e.g., DNA repair, autophagy, immune response) or human diseases, thereby generating a high-value, community-accessible roadmap of testable hypotheses for experimental biologists?

**Testable Hypotheses and Validation Strategy:**

*   **H1: Superior Predictive Performance:** We hypothesize that a multi-modal model integrating all five proposed data modalities will achieve significantly higher precision and recall in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms than any model based on a single data modality or a subset of modalities. 
    *   **Validation:** This hypothesis will be tested using a rigorous cross-validation strategy. We will construct a 'gold standard' set of well-characterized proteins, withhold a fraction for testing, and train our models on the remainder. Performance will be benchmarked using metrics like the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). We predict our full integrative model will outperform the best single-modality model by at least 20% in AUPRC, demonstrating a strong synergistic effect. An ablation study, systematically removing each data type, will quantify its unique contribution.
*   **H2: Confidence Correlates with Accuracy:** We hypothesize that the posterior probabilities generated by our Bayesian framework will serve as accurate confidence scores. Predictions supported by multiple, independent lines of evidence will receive higher probabilities and will be more likely to be correct.
    *   **Validation:** We will stratify our predictions for the test set by their posterior probability scores (e.g., <0.5, 0.5-0.7, 0.7-0.9, >0.9). We predict a strong monotonic relationship between the probability bin and the precision of the predictions within that bin. This will validate the framework's ability to provide users with a reliable measure of confidence.
*   **H3: Revealing Network Topologies:** We hypothesize that network analysis incorporating our high-confidence functional predictions for PUFs will reveal their non-random integration into the human interactome, identifying them as previously unknown hubs, bottlenecks, or bridges in cellular networks.
    *   **Validation:** We will construct an integrated functional association network and analyze the topological properties of newly annotated PUFs. We predict we will identify at least 50 PUFs that significantly increase the connectivity or information flow between known functional modules, and these predictions will be supported by multiple data types. We will use literature mining to seek corroborating evidence for a subset of these topological predictions.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a transdisciplinary working group with expertise in structural biology, bioinformatics, network science, and machine learning. The approach is organized into three phases: (1) Data Acquisition and Harmonization, (2) Development of the Integrative Inference Engine, and (3) Analysis, Dissemination, and Community Engagement. This project exclusively uses publicly available data and does not involve new experimental data generation, perfectly aligning with the research call's focus on data synthesis.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Pre-processing, and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase involves assembling and standardizing the diverse datasets that will fuel the inference engine. All data will be versioned and all processing scripts will be made publicly available.
*   **Structural Data:** We will download the complete set of human protein structure predictions from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB). We will use high-performance structural alignment tools like FoldSeek to systematically compare each PUF structure against a comprehensive library of experimentally determined structures from the PDB, annotated with functional domain information from CATH and SCOP. The output will be a matrix of structural similarity scores for each PUF against all known structural domains.
*   **Interaction & Association Data:** We will aggregate multiple large-scale PPI databases (BioGRID, STRING, HuRI, IntAct) into a unified, weighted human interactome. Confidence scores will be harmonized onto a common scale. Similarly, we will process bulk RNA-seq data from GTEx and single-cell RNA-seq data from the Human Cell Atlas to build context-specific co-expression networks, using metrics like Pearson correlation and mutual information.
*   **Phylogenetic & Phenotypic Data:** We will construct phylogenetic profiles (vectors of presence/absence across ~2,000 diverse species) for all human proteins using OrthoDB. Co-evolution between proteins will be calculated based on the similarity of their profiles. From the DepMap portal, we will acquire gene dependency and genetic interaction profiles from genome-wide CRISPR screens across hundreds of cancer cell lines.
*   **Ground Truth Annotations:** We will use the Gene Ontology (GO) as our functional vocabulary. To create a high-confidence 'gold standard' for training and validation, we will use GO annotations supported by experimental or curated evidence, excluding purely electronic annotations (IEA).

**Phase 2: The Bayesian Inference Engine (Months 7-24)**
This is the core methodological innovation of the project. We will develop a probabilistic framework to integrate the heterogeneous evidence.
*   **Feature Engineering:** For each protein and each data modality, we will generate a feature vector that summarizes its relationship to known functions. For example, the PPI feature vector for a PUF will represent its connectivity strength to proteins associated with every GO term.
*   **Bayesian Framework:** We will implement a Naive Bayes classifier, a well-established and interpretable machine learning model. For each PUF and each potential function (GO term) *F*, we will calculate the posterior probability P(F | D_struct, D_ppi, D_coex, D_phylo, D_pheno). This is proportional to the prior probability of the function, P(F), multiplied by the likelihood of observing the data for each modality given that function, Π P(D_i | F). The likelihood terms will be learned from our gold-standard set of well-characterized proteins. This framework elegantly handles missing data and provides a natural, interpretable confidence score (the posterior probability) for each prediction.
*   **Network-based Refinement:** The initial Bayesian predictions will be further refined using network propagation algorithms (e.g., random walk with restart) on an integrated functional network. This allows functional information to flow from well-characterized proteins to their network neighbors, boosting confidence in predictions for PUFs that are tightly clustered with proteins of a known function.

**Phase 3: Analysis, Dissemination, and Training (Months 25-36)**
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and harmonization (M9). Develop and benchmark single-modality predictors (M12). First in-person working group meeting.
    *   **Year 2:** Implement and validate the full Bayesian integration engine (M18). Generate first proteome-wide set of predictions (M24). Begin development of the public web portal. Second in-person meeting.
    *   **Year 3:** Launch beta version of the web portal for community feedback (M30). Submit primary manuscript and database resource paper (M36). Host a virtual training workshop. Final meeting to plan for long-term sustainability.
*   **Open Science:** All code will be developed in a public GitHub repository under a permissive license. Analysis workflows will be containerized (Docker) and managed with Snakemake to ensure full reproducibility. All generated data and predictions will be deposited in Zenodo and made accessible through the portal.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will produce a suite of transformative resources, methodologies, and biological insights that will significantly advance the molecular and cellular sciences. Its impact will be felt across basic and translational research by addressing the fundamental problem of protein function annotation at an unprecedented scale.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **A Comprehensive Functional Annotation Resource:** The primary outcome will be a publicly accessible, interactive web portal providing the most comprehensive functional predictions for the human proteome to date. For thousands of PUFs, this resource will offer specific, evidence-based hypotheses regarding their molecular function, biological process, and subcellular localization. Each prediction will be accompanied by a confidence score and a detailed breakdown of the supporting evidence from each data modality, empowering researchers to make informed decisions about experimental follow-up.
2.  **A Novel, Open-Source Integration Framework:** We will deliver a robust, open-source computational pipeline for multi-modal data integration and functional inference. This Bayesian framework will serve as a methodological blueprint for the field, adaptable for other species or different types of biological questions. Its open and reproducible nature ensures its long-term utility and extensibility by the broader scientific community.
3.  **High-Confidence Biological Hypotheses:** We anticipate generating specific, testable hypotheses for hundreds of PUFs. For example, we might predict that a PUF with structural similarity to a ubiquitin ligase, which is co-expressed with proteasome components and whose knockout confers resistance to a proteasome inhibitor, is a novel component of the protein degradation machinery. We will highlight a curated list of the top 100 most promising PUF annotations to catalyze experimental validation.

**Broader Impact and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Discovery in Basic Biology:** Our resource will act as a hypothesis generator for the entire biological research community. A cell biologist studying mitosis who identifies a PUF in their screen can instantly access our portal to see if it is predicted to be a novel kinase or a microtubule-associated protein, dramatically accelerating the pace of their research.
*   **Enabling Translational and Clinical Research:** Understanding protein function is paramount for understanding disease. Our work will help interpret data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and clinical proteomics by providing functional context for previously unannotated genes and proteins linked to disease. Furthermore, by identifying novel enzymes, receptors, or signaling proteins, we will expand the 'druggable' proteome, revealing new potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdocs in the working group will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary skills in computational structural biology, network analysis, machine learning, and open, team-based science. We will further broaden our training impact by developing tutorials and hosting a virtual workshop to teach the wider community how to use our tools and interpret the results, fostering a more data-savvy workforce.

**Dissemination and Sustainability Plan:**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-pronged. The primary vehicle is the open-access web portal. We will also publish our findings in high-impact journals (*Nature*, *Science*, *Nature Methods*) and present at key international conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, ASCB). To ensure long-term sustainability, the portal will be designed for automated quarterly updates as its underlying data sources are refreshed. The open-source code and containerized workflows will allow the resource to live on and be maintained by the community. We will seek follow-on funding from NIH or other agencies to support the portal's long-term maintenance and to expand its scope to other model organisms, solidifying its role as a cornerstone resource in functional genomics.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_03,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Predicting the Composition and Regulation of Biomolecular Condensates through Integrative Data Synthesis,"The formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an emergent principle of cellular organization, concentrating molecules to regulate biochemical reactions. However, the 'grammar' that dictates which proteins form condensates, their composition, and their regulation remains poorly defined. This project will assemble a working group of biophysicists, cell biologists, and data scientists to build a predictive model of the cellular 'condensatome'. We will synthesize a diverse array of public data, including: 1) Protein sequence features from UniProt, focusing on intrinsically disordered regions and low-complexity domains; 2) Post-translational modification (PTM) data from repositories like PhosphoSitePlus, as PTMs are key regulators of LLPS; 3) Experimentally determined and predicted protein structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB) to understand how structure influences phase separation; 4) High-content imaging data from resources like the Image Data Resource to identify proteins that co-localize in cellular puncta; and 5) Protein-protein interaction and co-expression data to infer condensate partnerships. The core of the project is to develop a suite of machine learning models that can predict a protein's propensity to phase separate, its likely interaction partners within a condensate, and the PTMs that regulate its assembly/disassembly. This synthesis will produce a comprehensive, predictive atlas of LLPS, providing a powerful tool for generating testable hypotheses about the role of condensates in health and disease.",,"Background And Significance

The compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells into membrane-bound organelles is a foundational concept in biology. However, a paradigm shift is underway, revealing that cells also employ a vast network of membrane-less organelles, or biomolecular condensates, to organize their cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. These dynamic, fluid-like assemblies form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a physical process where multivalent macromolecules, primarily proteins and nucleic acids, de-mix from the surrounding solution to form a condensed phase. This emergent phenomenon allows cells to concentrate specific molecules, thereby accelerating biochemical reactions, sequestering components, and organizing complex cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, RNA processing in P-bodies, and the stress response in stress granules. The discovery of LLPS as a widespread organizing principle has revolutionized our understanding of cellular function and dysfunction. Aberrant phase transitions are increasingly implicated in a range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, where liquid condensates pathologically mature into solid, fibrillar aggregates, as well as in various cancers where condensates can drive oncogenic transcription programs. Despite the rapid expansion of the field, our knowledge remains largely descriptive and fragmented. The 'molecular grammar'—the set of rules that determines which proteins can phase separate, what partners they recruit into a condensate, and how these processes are regulated—is still poorly understood. Current research has identified key drivers of LLPS, particularly proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low-complexity domains (LCDs). These regions lack stable tertiary structure and engage in numerous weak, transient interactions (e.g., pi-pi stacking, cation-pi, electrostatic interactions) that collectively drive phase separation. Several computational tools have been developed to predict LLPS propensity based on these sequence features (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE). However, these first-generation predictors are often trained on limited datasets of well-studied proteins and typically neglect other critical factors. For instance, structured domains can act as scaffolds or interaction hubs within condensates, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation are known to be potent regulators, capable of dissolving or promoting condensate formation by altering a protein's charge and interaction capabilities. The key limitation in the field is the lack of data integration. A wealth of publicly available data exists that could inform a more holistic model of LLPS, but it resides in disparate databases. Protein sequences and IDR annotations are in UniProt and DisProt; PTM data is in PhosphoSitePlus; protein structures are in the PDB and AlphaFold DB; protein-protein interactions are in BioGRID and STRING; and cellular localization patterns are captured in high-content imaging datasets like the Human Protein Atlas and the Image Data Resource. No single research lab possesses the diverse expertise required to effectively mine, integrate, and synthesize these multimodal data types. This project is therefore both important and timely. It is important because a predictive, systems-level understanding of the cellular 'condensatome' would provide a powerful framework for generating hypotheses about cellular function in health and disease. It is timely because the recent explosion in publicly available biological data, particularly the proteome-wide structural predictions from AlphaFold, presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally decode the grammar of LLPS. By assembling a multidisciplinary working group of biophysicists, cell biologists, and data scientists, this project will perform the community-scale synthesis needed to bridge this critical knowledge gap, moving the field from a collection of individual examples to a comprehensive, predictive science.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, integrative computational framework to predict the composition, regulation, and functional context of the cellular 'condensatome'. We will achieve this by addressing three fundamental, interconnected research questions, each associated with a specific, testable hypothesis. Our approach is designed to synthesize fragmented public data into a unified predictive model, creating a powerful resource for the entire molecular and cellular biology community. 

**Research Question 1: What are the universal sequence, structural, and physicochemical features that accurately predict a protein's intrinsic propensity to undergo LLPS across the human proteome?**
While IDRs and LCDs are known drivers, many structured proteins also participate in LLPS, and the specific combination of features that confers this ability remains elusive. We need to move beyond simple sequence metrics to a more holistic model.
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** An integrative machine learning model, trained on a synthesized dataset of protein sequence features (IDR length, amino acid composition, charge patterning), structural features (solvent accessibility, domain architecture from PDB/AlphaFold), and biophysical properties, will significantly outperform existing single-feature predictors in identifying LLPS-prone proteins.
*   **Prediction:** Our multi-modal model will achieve an Area Under the Curve (AUC) greater than 0.9 on a rigorously curated, held-out test set of experimentally validated phase-separating and non-phase-separating proteins. This would represent a substantial improvement in predictive power over existing tools.
*   **Validation:** The model's predictive performance will be benchmarked against all publicly available LLPS predictors. Crucially, we will perform prospective validation by testing its predictions against newly published experimental data that was not used during training or testing. The model will generate a ranked list of novel, high-confidence LLPS candidates, which will be a key deliverable for community-led experimental validation.

**Research Question 2: How can we systematically predict the composition of specific biomolecular condensates by integrating protein-protein interaction, co-expression, and co-localization data?**
Condensates are complex, multi-component bodies, but their complete parts lists are largely unknown. We aim to develop a method to predict the network of 'scaffolds' (drivers of LLPS) and 'clients' (recruited components) that constitute a given condensate.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** A network-based model that integrates physical protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, gene co-expression profiles, and spatial co-localization scores derived from high-content imaging can predict the core components and transient clients of known condensates with high precision and recall.
*   **Prediction:** For well-characterized condensates like stress granules and P-bodies, our model will correctly identify over 80% of known core components while also predicting novel, high-confidence members that are functionally related.
*   **Validation:** We will validate our predicted condensate compositions by comparing them against published mass spectrometry-based proteomics of purified condensates. Furthermore, we will use Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses to assess the functional coherence of our predicted condensate modules, expecting to see significant enrichment for relevant biological processes.

**Research Question 3: What is the regulatory code of PTMs that governs the dynamic assembly and disassembly of condensates, and can we predict which PTMs are key modulators?**
PTMs are critical for the dynamic control of LLPS, but a systematic understanding of which PTMs regulate which proteins is missing. We seek to build a model that can predict the functional impact of a PTM on a protein's phase separation behavior.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** Specific PTMs, particularly phosphorylation within or flanking IDRs, act as context-dependent molecular 'switches' for LLPS. A model incorporating PTM site information, local sequence context, predicted structural changes, and evolutionary conservation will accurately predict the regulatory effect (promotion vs. inhibition) of a given PTM.
*   **Prediction:** The model will correctly classify the functional effect of over 75% of known regulatory PTMs curated from the literature. Applied proteome-wide, it will predict thousands of novel regulatory PTM sites.
*   **Validation:** We will cross-reference our predictions with large-scale phosphoproteomics datasets from studies involving stimuli known to alter cellular organization (e.g., stress, cell cycle progression). We will test for a statistically significant correlation between the phosphorylation status of our predicted regulatory sites and the experimental conditions. The resulting ranked list of predicted regulatory PTMs will be a primary deliverable, providing a rich set of testable hypotheses for experimentalists.

Methods And Approach

This project is founded on the principle of transdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together a working group with expertise in biophysics, cell biology, and data science. The project will be executed in three overlapping phases, guided by our three research questions. Our approach is designed to be modular, iterative, and fully aligned with open science principles.

**Working Group and Project Management:**
The working group will consist of three core teams. The **Biophysics Team** will guide the selection and engineering of physicochemical features relevant to LLPS, ensuring our models are grounded in physical principles. The **Cell Biology Team** will lead the curation of 'gold standard' training and validation datasets from the literature and provide crucial biological context for interpreting model outputs. The **Data Science Team** will lead the development of the data integration pipeline, machine learning models, and the public-facing web portal. The project will be managed through bi-weekly virtual meetings, a shared project management platform (e.g., Asana), and annual in-person workshops to facilitate deep collaboration and training.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Integration, and Curation (Months 1-12)**
This foundational phase involves building a comprehensive, integrated database that will serve as the input for all subsequent modeling. We will use only publicly available data.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Sequence & Disorder:** Human proteome sequences from UniProt; IDR predictions from DisProt and IUPred2.
    *   **Biophysical Features:** Custom Python scripts will be used to calculate sequence-level features like amino acid composition, sequence complexity (SCD), charge patterning (SCD, κ), and hydrophobicity.
    *   **Structural Features:** We will systematically process all human protein structures from the PDB and the AlphaFold DB. We will use tools like DSSP and NACCESS to compute secondary structure and solvent accessibility. We will also featurize domain architectures from Pfam.
    *   **PTM Data:** Data on experimentally verified PTMs, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, will be aggregated from PhosphoSitePlus, UniProt, and dbPTM.
    *   **Interaction & Expression Data:** Physical PPIs will be sourced from BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct. Co-expression data will be derived from large-scale RNA-seq datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
    *   **Localization Data:** We will leverage the subcellular localization annotations from the Human Protein Atlas. For quantitative co-localization, we will develop an automated image analysis pipeline using CellProfiler to process high-content imaging screens from the Image Data Resource (IDR), quantifying the degree to which proteins form puncta and co-localize.
*   **Curation of 'Ground Truth' Sets:** The Cell Biology Team will perform an extensive literature review to curate a high-confidence set of ~500 human proteins with strong experimental evidence for undergoing LLPS and a matched set of non-phase-separating proteins. This will form our 'gold standard' for training and testing the LLPS propensity model (H1).

**Phase 2: Predictive Modeling (Months 10-30)**
*   **Model for H1 (LLPS Propensity):** We will develop a machine learning classifier to distinguish LLPS-prone proteins from the rest of the proteome. We will employ a gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) due to its high performance and interpretability. All integrated features from Phase 1 will be used as input. The model will be trained using 5-fold cross-validation on 80% of the 'gold standard' set, with the remaining 20% held out for final testing. We will use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret the model, identifying the key features that drive LLPS prediction.
*   **Model for H2 (Condensate Composition):** We will construct a weighted, multi-layer protein network. An unsupervised approach using community detection algorithms (e.g., Leiden algorithm) will be used for de novo discovery of condensate-like modules. In parallel, we will use a supervised approach, training a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the network neighborhoods of known condensate components to predict new members for those and other condensates.
*   **Model for H3 (PTM Regulation):** We will create a dataset where each instance is a known PTM. Features will include the type of PTM, the physicochemical property change it induces, the local sequence and structural context (e.g., within an IDR, on a protein surface), and evolutionary conservation of the site. We will train a multi-class classifier (e.g., Random Forest) to predict the PTM's effect as 'promoting', 'inhibiting', or 'no effect' on LLPS.

**Phase 3: Synthesis, Dissemination, and Training (Months 24-36)**
*   **The Condensatome Atlas:** The predictions from all three models will be integrated to create a comprehensive atlas of the human condensatome. This atlas will provide, for every protein, its predicted LLPS propensity, its predicted condensate partners, and the PTMs predicted to regulate its behavior.
*   **Web Portal:** We will develop a user-friendly, open-access web portal to host the atlas. The portal will allow users to search for their protein of interest, view all associated predictions in an intuitive graphical format, and download the underlying data.
*   **Open Science:** All curated data, source code for analysis and modeling, and the models themselves will be made publicly available through GitHub and Zenodo repositories with permissive licenses, ensuring full reproducibility and adherence to FAIR principles.

**Timeline & Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data integration pipeline and 'gold standard' dataset curation. First working group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Development and validation of H1 and H2 models. Beta version of the web portal. Presentation of initial results at a major conference.
*   **Year 3:** Development and validation of H3 model. Full public release of the Condensatome Atlas and web portal. Final working group meeting and submission of capstone manuscripts.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate significant outcomes that will have a transformative impact on the field of molecular and cellular biology, directly addressing the core goals of this research call. Our work will shift the study of biomolecular condensates from a descriptive to a predictive science, providing a powerful hypothesis-generation engine for the global research community.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **An Integrated, Publicly Available Data Resource:** The first major outcome will be a comprehensive, curated database that integrates diverse data modalities—sequence, structure, PTMs, interactions, and localization—relevant to LLPS for the entire human proteome. This resource alone will be invaluable, saving individual labs countless hours of data wrangling and enabling novel analyses.
2.  **A Suite of Advanced Predictive Models:** We will deliver three open-source, state-of-the-art machine learning models: one to predict a protein's intrinsic LLPS propensity, a second to predict the composition of condensate communities, and a third to predict the regulatory impact of PTMs on LLPS. These tools will provide a multi-layered, systems-level view of phase separation.
3.  **The Human 'Condensatome' Atlas:** The synthesis of our model predictions will culminate in a comprehensive, first-draft atlas of the human condensatome. This atlas, accessible via a user-friendly web portal, will provide a global map of membrane-less organization within the cell, highlighting known condensates and predicting hundreds of novel ones.
4.  **Training of a New Generation of Scientists:** Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are central to this project. They will receive unique cross-disciplinary training at the interface of biophysics, cell biology, and data science, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy scientific workforce.

**Scientific Impact and Contribution to the Field:**
Our project will provide a unifying framework for understanding the principles of LLPS. By identifying the key combinations of features that drive phase separation and its regulation, we will help to finally decode the 'molecular grammar' of this fundamental process. The Condensatome Atlas will generate thousands of specific, testable hypotheses. For example, it might predict that a previously uncharacterized metabolic enzyme is a core component of stress granules, suggesting a direct link between metabolic state and the stress response. This will empower individual research labs to design targeted experiments, dramatically accelerating the pace of discovery. Our work will provide crucial context for interpreting large-scale datasets, such as identifying which hits in a genetic screen are likely to function by altering condensate properties.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
Given the strong links between aberrant phase separation and disease, our work has significant translational potential. The predictive models can be used to systematically analyze the impact of disease-associated mutations. For instance, we can predict whether a mutation found in an ALS patient alters a protein's LLPS propensity or disrupts a key regulatory PTM site, providing a mechanistic hypothesis for its pathogenicity. This will aid in prioritizing variants of unknown significance from clinical sequencing studies. Furthermore, by identifying the key drivers and regulatory nodes of disease-relevant condensates, our atlas could reveal novel therapeutic targets for developing drugs that modulate condensate formation or dissolution.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
We are committed to rapid and broad dissemination. Our findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. The primary vehicle for impact, however, will be the public web portal, which will make our data and predictions immediately accessible to all. We will present our work at major international conferences and organize workshops to train the community on using our tools. Our long-term vision is for this resource to become the definitive, 'go-to' platform for LLPS research, analogous to the STRING database for protein interactions or the Gene Ontology consortium for gene function. The collaborative network established by this working group will be sustained beyond the funding period, with plans to continuously update the atlas as new public data becomes available, ensuring its lasting value to the scientific community.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_04,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Reconstructing the Proto-Eukaryotic Interactome by Synthesizing Cross-Phyla Genomic and Proteomic Data,"The emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic ancestors represents one of the most profound evolutionary transitions in the history of life. This project seeks to computationally reconstruct the protein-protein interaction network (interactome) of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) to understand the molecular origins of eukaryotic complexity. This requires a massive data synthesis effort far beyond the scope of any single lab. Our working group, composed of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and computational scientists, will integrate data from hundreds of genomes and proteomes spanning all major eukaryotic supergroups (including under-sampled protist lineages), Asgard archaea (the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes), and other prokaryotes. The methodology will involve: 1) Orthology inference to identify protein families present in LECA; 2) Ancestral sequence reconstruction to approximate LECA protein sequences; and 3) Integration of experimentally determined interactomes from diverse model organisms (e.g., yeast, human, fly) with structural modeling and co-evolutionary analyses to infer ancestral protein interactions. By comparing the reconstructed LECA interactome with those of modern prokaryotes, we will pinpoint the key molecular innovations—such as the emergence of the ubiquitin system, the nuclear pore complex, and the endomembrane system—that enabled the rise of cellular complexity. This project will provide a foundational model of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, offering deep insights into the emergence of its defining features.",,"Background And Significance

The transition from simple prokaryotic cells to complex eukaryotic cells, known as eukaryogenesis, represents one of the most significant and enigmatic events in evolutionary history. This transition, which occurred over two billion years ago, established the cellular architecture that underpins all visible life, including fungi, plants, and animals. Eukaryotic cells are defined by a suite of complex innovations absent in prokaryotes, such as a membrane-bound nucleus, mitochondria, an extensive endomembrane system for trafficking and secretion, a dynamic cytoskeleton, and sophisticated regulatory networks like the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Understanding the origin of these features is a grand challenge in modern biology. The prevailing theory of eukaryogenesis posits a symbiotic merger between an archaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont that evolved into the mitochondrion. Recent discoveries of the Asgard archaea, which possess genes for many 'eukaryotic signature proteins' (ESPs), have provided unprecedented insight into the nature of the archaeal host, suggesting it was already primed for complexity. However, these discoveries have primarily focused on reconstructing the genomic 'parts list' of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), the hypothetical organism from which all extant eukaryotes descend. Seminal studies have successfully inferred the gene content of LECA, revealing a complex proteome with thousands of protein families involved in uniquely eukaryotic functions. While this 'parts list' is foundational, it is critically insufficient for understanding cellular function. Complexity does not arise from the mere presence of components, but from the intricate network of interactions among them. A cell's proteome is not a static collection of proteins but a dynamic system organized by a protein-protein interaction network, or 'interactome'. It is the wiring of this network that dictates cellular organization, function, and regulation. The key gap in our current knowledge is the lack of a systems-level understanding of how LECA's proteins were interconnected. We have a blueprint of the building blocks but no schematic for how they were assembled into functional machines. Previous research on interactome evolution has been limited, often focusing on the conservation of interactions within small, well-defined pathways or across closely related species. No study has attempted to reconstruct an entire ancestral interactome at the deep evolutionary timescale of LECA. This research is now timely and feasible due to a confluence of factors that align perfectly with the goals of this research call. First, the explosion of publicly available genomic and proteomic data provides the necessary raw material. This includes hundreds of genomes from diverse eukaryotic lineages, particularly from previously under-sampled protists (e.g., from the EukProt and MMETSP projects), which are essential for accurately inferring ancestral states. The availability of Asgard archaeal genomes provides the critical prokaryotic outgroup. Second, large-scale experimental interactome maps from multiple, distantly related model organisms (human, yeast, fly, plant) are now available in public repositories like BioGRID and IntAct. This cross-species data is the foundation for inferring ancestral interactions. Third, computational methods have matured significantly, with powerful tools for orthology inference, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and, most recently, highly accurate protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold2), which can be used to validate predicted interactions. This project will synthesize these disparate data types using a novel integrative approach to fill the critical gap in our understanding of eukaryogenesis. By reconstructing the LECA interactome, we will move from a static gene list to a dynamic network model of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, providing the first mechanistic, systems-level view of how eukaryotic complexity originated.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to reconstruct a high-confidence model of the LECA protein-protein interactome and leverage it to test specific hypotheses about the emergence of eukaryotic cellular complexity. Our research is structured around three central questions.

Research Question 1: What was the size, topology, and modular organization of the LECA interactome compared to its prokaryotic precursors?
This question addresses the global architectural shift in cellular organization during eukaryogenesis. We hypothesize that the transition was accompanied by a quantum leap in the complexity of the cellular interaction network.
*   Hypothesis 1a: The LECA interactome was significantly larger and more densely connected than any known prokaryotic interactome, reflecting a step-change in cellular complexity. We predict that the reconstructed LECA interactome will contain over 50,000 high-confidence interactions, an order of magnitude greater than typical prokaryotic networks. Furthermore, we predict its network topology (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient) will be quantitatively more similar to modern eukaryotic interactomes than to those of Asgard archaea. This hypothesis will be tested by computing standard network metrics for our reconstructed LECA interactome and performing statistical comparisons against a curated set of interactomes from diverse modern eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
*   Hypothesis 1b: The LECA interactome was organized into distinct functional modules corresponding to nascent eukaryotic organelles and systems. We predict that applying community detection algorithms to the LECA network will reveal protein clusters significantly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with core eukaryotic functions like 'nuclear transport', 'vesicular trafficking', and 'cytoskeletal organization'. We further predict these modules will be largely absent or rudimentary in prokaryotic networks. This will be tested by applying the Louvain algorithm to the LECA network, performing functional enrichment analysis on the resulting modules, and systematically comparing their composition and connectivity to modules identified in Asgard archaeal networks.

Research Question 2: Which specific protein interaction networks drove the emergence of key eukaryotic innovations?
This question moves from global properties to the specific molecular machines that define eukaryotes.
*   Hypothesis 2a: The origin of the endomembrane system was driven by the de novo assembly of a novel network of small GTPases (Rabs, Arfs), coat proteins (e.g., clathrin), and tethering complexes. We predict that our LECA interactome will contain a highly interconnected subnetwork of these protein families, which is largely absent in Asgard archaea, although some individual components may have prokaryotic homologs. We will test this by isolating the subnetwork of proteins orthologous to modern trafficking machinery, analyzing its structure, and tracing the emergence of its key interactions along the phylogenetic tree from prokaryotes to LECA.
*   Hypothesis 2b: The ubiquitin signaling system emerged as a massive expansion of interactions involving E1, E2, and E3 ligases, creating a new layer of regulatory control over pre-existing cellular processes. We predict the LECA interactome will feature a 'hub-and-spoke' topology around ubiquitin and a vast network of E3 ligases and their substrates, dwarfing the rudimentary ubiquitin-like systems in prokaryotes. We will test this by mapping the ubiquitin-related subnetwork in LECA, comparing its size and connectivity to prokaryotic precursor systems, and identifying which cellular processes (e.g., cell cycle control, protein degradation) were the earliest targets of this new regulatory system by analyzing the functions of the inferred ancestral substrates.

Research Question 3: How did the LECA interactome evolve from its prokaryotic precursors?
This question addresses the evolutionary mechanisms that built the new network.
*   Hypothesis 3a: A significant fraction of LECA interactions originated through the 'rewiring' of pre-existing prokaryotic protein domains into new combinations and contexts. We predict that we will find many instances where two interacting protein families in LECA have prokaryotic orthologs that do not interact. This will be tested by using a domain-centric approach to trace the evolutionary history of interactions, distinguishing between inherited interactions, novel interactions between ancient proteins, and interactions involving newly evolved eukaryotic-specific proteins.
*   Hypothesis 3b: The endosymbiosis of the proto-mitochondrion involved the large-scale integration of bacterial proteins into the host's interaction network. We predict that proteins of alphaproteobacterial origin in the LECA proteome will show a statistically significant number of interactions with proteins of archaeal (host) origin, particularly in metabolic and signaling pathways. This will be tested by classifying all LECA proteins by their likely phylogenetic origin (archaeal, bacterial, or de novo) and testing for non-random interaction patterns between these classes, thereby mapping the molecular footprint of the endosymbiotic event.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that will exclusively use publicly available data. Our approach is a multi-stage computational pipeline that integrates phylogenomics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and network inference, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group. The project is organized into three primary aims.

Aim 1: Assembling a Comprehensive Phylogenetic Dataset and Inferring the LECA Proteome.
The foundation of our project is a carefully curated dataset of genomes and proteomes. 
*   Data Sources: We will download complete proteomes from public databases including NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl, and the JGI. Our dataset will comprise three main groups: 1) A taxonomically broad set of ~200 eukaryotic species spanning all major supergroups (e.g., Amorphea, Diaphoretickes), with a special focus on including under-sampled protist lineages from the EukProt and MMETSP databases to break long phylogenetic branches and improve inference accuracy. 2) A comprehensive set of ~50 proteomes from the Asgard archaea superphylum (Loki-, Thor-, Odin-, Heimdallarchaeota), which represent the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. 3) A diverse outgroup of ~50 proteomes from other archaeal and bacterial phyla, including Alphaproteobacteria, to root our analyses and trace the origin of endosymbiont-derived genes.
*   Orthology Inference and LECA Proteome Reconstruction: We will use OrthoFinder to define protein families (orthogroups) across our entire species set. OrthoFinder's graph-based approach is robust to varying evolutionary distances. A protein family will be inferred as present in LECA if it is found in representatives of at least two major eukaryotic supergroups. We will refine this inference using a likelihood-based phylogenetic presence/absence method (e.g., GLOOME) to assign a probability score for each family's presence in LECA. This process will yield a high-confidence LECA proteome, which forms the set of nodes for our ancestral network.

Aim 2: Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) for LECA Proteins.
To enable structural and co-evolutionary analyses, we must infer the primary sequences of LECA proteins.
*   Phylogenetic Pipeline: For each protein family inferred to be in LECA, we will generate a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT and construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE, which automatically selects the best-fit model of sequence evolution. The trees will be manually inspected for quality.
*   Ancestral Sequence Inference: Using the gene family tree and alignment, we will perform ASR using an empirical Bayesian or maximum likelihood method (e.g., as implemented in PAML or PhyloBot). This will generate the most probable amino acid sequence for the LECA version of each protein. We will also calculate posterior probabilities for each reconstructed amino acid site to quantify uncertainty, which can be propagated into downstream analyses.

Aim 3: Reconstructing and Analyzing the LECA Interactome.
This aim constitutes the core of the project, where we infer the connections (edges) between the LECA proteins (nodes).
*   Interaction Data Aggregation: We will compile a meta-database of experimentally determined, physical protein-protein interactions from major public repositories, including BioGRID, IntAct, DIP, and MINT. We will filter for high-quality evidence (e.g., yeast-two-hybrid, affinity purification-mass spectrometry) from multiple, distantly related model eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, A. thaliana) to build a robust reference set.
*   Ancestral Interaction Inference: We will use a powerful, multi-evidence approach. An interaction between two LECA proteins will be considered high-confidence if supported by at least two of the following independent methods:
    1.  Phylogenetic Profiling of Interactions (Interolog Mapping): This is our primary discovery method. If orthologs of protein A and protein B are known to interact in multiple, divergent modern species, we can parsimoniously infer that the ancestral proteins A' and B' also interacted in LECA. We will use a probabilistic framework that maps known interactions onto the species tree to infer the likelihood of the interaction's presence at the LECA node.
    2.  Co-evolutionary Analysis: For each pair of LECA protein families, we will construct a paired multiple sequence alignment. We will then use methods like DCA (Direct Coupling Analysis) or GREMLIN to detect co-evolving residue pairs. A strong co-evolutionary signal between two protein families is powerful, independent evidence of a direct physical interaction.
    3.  Structural Modeling Validation: For key predicted interactions, particularly those in novel eukaryotic complexes, we will use the reconstructed ancestral sequences as input for AlphaFold-Multimer. A high-confidence predicted structure (high pLDDT and PAE scores) with a well-defined, low-energy interface will provide strong physical evidence for the plausibility of the interaction. This computationally intensive step will be used to validate hundreds of the most critical or novel predicted interactions.
*   Network Analysis and Hypothesis Testing: The final LECA interactome will be assembled from all high-confidence interactions. We will use network analysis tools (e.g., Cytoscape, NetworkX) to analyze its global topology, detect functional modules, and isolate subnetworks corresponding to our specific hypotheses. Statistical comparisons with modern prokaryotic and eukaryotic networks will be performed to test our predictions about the growth of complexity.

Timeline:
*   Year 1: Data aggregation, establishment of the phylogenomic pipeline, and generation of the LECA proteome. First working group meeting.
*   Year 2: Completion of ASR for all LECA proteins. Implementation and benchmarking of the three interaction inference methods. Generation of a draft LECA interactome. Trainee workshop.
*   Year 3: Refinement and validation of the interactome. In-depth network analysis to test hypotheses 1-3. Comparative analysis with prokaryotic networks. Second working group meeting.
*   Year 4: Analysis of key subnetworks, manuscript preparation, and development of the public web portal for data dissemination. Final working group meeting.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate significant outcomes that will have a lasting impact on the fields of cell biology, evolutionary biology, and systems biology. Its contributions are both intellectual and practical, aligning perfectly with the NCEMS mission to catalyze transformative synthesis research.

Expected Outcomes:
1.  The Reconstructed LECA Interactome: The primary deliverable will be a high-confidence, computationally reconstructed protein-protein interaction network for the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. This network, comprising thousands of proteins and tens of thousands of interactions, will be the first systems-level functional model of this pivotal ancestral organism. It will be made publicly available as a foundational resource for the scientific community.
2.  A Catalog of Eukaryotic Molecular Innovations: By comparing the LECA interactome to prokaryotic networks, we will identify the specific interaction modules and wiring changes that underpinned key eukaryotic innovations. This will provide a mechanistic roadmap of eukaryogenesis, pinpointing the assembly of novel complexes like the nuclear pore and the expansion of regulatory networks like the ubiquitin system.
3.  A Validated Methodological Pipeline: We will develop and disseminate a novel, robust computational pipeline for reconstructing deep ancestral interactomes. This integrative framework, combining phylogenetics, co-evolution, and structural modeling, will be a valuable tool applicable to studying other major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of multicellularity or phototrophy.

Intellectual Impact:
This research will fundamentally shift our understanding of eukaryogenesis from a gene-centric view to a network-centric one. It will provide concrete, testable hypotheses about the function and organization of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, transforming a subject of speculation into one of computational and quantitative inquiry. By revealing how molecular complexity is built through the evolution of interaction networks, our work will provide general principles of systems evolution. It will allow researchers to ask new questions, such as which cellular processes were the first to be regulated by phosphorylation or ubiquitination, or how the metabolic network of the host and endosymbiont were integrated at the protein level. This resource will fuel hypothesis-driven experimental work for years, for instance, by guiding synthetic biologists attempting to engineer eukaryotic-like features in prokaryotic chassis.

Broader Impacts:
*   Training and Workforce Development: This project is an ideal training ground for the next generation of data-savvy biologists. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will work at the intersection of genomics, systems biology, and evolutionary theory, gaining highly sought-after skills in large-scale data analysis, high-performance computing, and collaborative, open science. We will host an annual virtual workshop on data synthesis methods, open to the broader community, to amplify our training impact.
*   Fostering Collaboration and Open Science: This working group unites researchers from evolutionary biology, cell biology, and computational science, creating a transdisciplinary environment that is essential for success. We are fully committed to open science principles. All analysis scripts will be shared on GitHub, all data will be deposited in public repositories, and the final interactome will be accessible through a user-friendly web portal. This ensures our work is transparent, reproducible, and maximally beneficial to the scientific community.
*   Dissemination and Public Engagement: We will disseminate our findings through high-impact, open-access publications and presentations at major international conferences (e.g., SMBE, ASCB). We will also develop educational materials, including interactive visualizations of the ancestral cell's network, for use in undergraduate courses and public outreach, making this fundamental story of our own cellular origins accessible to a wider audience.

Long-Term Vision:
The LECA interactome is not an endpoint but a starting point. It will serve as a scaffold for future studies, such as integrating metabolic network data, transcriptomic data, or protein-DNA interactions to build an even more comprehensive multi-scale model of the ancestral cell. This project will build a collaborative community and a methodological foundation that will sustain research into deep evolutionary transitions long after the funding period ends.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a massive data synthesis and analysis effort that is beyond the scope of any single research laboratory. It requires the integration of hundreds of proteomes, the execution of computationally demanding analyses on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, and, most importantly, the combined and synergistic expertise of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and computational scientists. A single PI lab lacks the personnel bandwidth and the full spectrum of specialized skills needed to successfully execute this project. The NCEMS working group model is therefore essential, providing the necessary framework and resources to support this large-scale, collaborative science.

Funding is requested for a four-year period with a total budget of $800,000. The budget is primarily allocated to support the personnel who will perform the intensive computational work and the resources required for that work.

Budget Breakdown:

A. Personnel ($520,000): This is the largest budget category, as the project's success depends on dedicated researchers to drive the analysis.
*   Postdoctoral Scholars (2 FTE for 4 years): $280,000. We request support for two postdoctoral scholars who will be the core analytical engine of the project. One postdoc, with expertise in phylogenomics, will be responsible for data curation, orthology inference, and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The second postdoc, with a background in computational systems biology, will focus on interaction inference, network analysis, and structural modeling. This covers competitive salaries and benefits.
*   Graduate Students (2 students, 50% support for 4 years): $160,000. Support for two graduate students will provide invaluable training opportunities and dedicated effort on specific sub-projects, such as analyzing the evolution of the endomembrane system or the spliceosome interactome.
*   Data Manager/Programmer (0.25 FTE for 4 years): $80,000. Part-time support for a programmer is critical for managing the terabyte-scale datasets, maintaining the complex computational pipeline, and leading the development of the public-facing web portal.

B. Travel ($80,000):
*   Annual Working Group Meetings: $60,000. To facilitate deep collaboration, we will hold one in-person meeting per year for all PIs, postdocs, and students. These meetings are indispensable for strategic planning, troubleshooting complex analytical problems, and synthesizing results.
*   Conference Travel: $20,000. To support trainees in presenting our findings at key international conferences (e.g., SMBE, ASCB, ISMB), which is vital for dissemination and professional development.

C. Computational Resources ($120,000):
*   HPC Cluster Access & Cloud Computing Credits: $80,000. The phylogenetic analyses of thousands of gene families and the structural modeling of protein complexes with AlphaFold-Multimer are extremely computationally intensive and require significant allocation on a national or institutional HPC cluster.
*   Data Storage: $40,000. Funds for robust, long-term storage and backup of raw genomic data, intermediate analysis files, and final results.

D. Publication and Dissemination ($30,000):
*   Open Access Publication Fees: $20,000. To ensure all resulting manuscripts are published in high-impact open-access journals, adhering to our open science commitment.
*   Web Portal Development & Hosting: $10,000. For server costs, domain registration, and any specialized software required for the public database.

Existing Resources: The PIs will contribute significant existing resources, including their time, laboratory and office space, and access to institutional computational infrastructure and licensed software. The requested NCEMS funds will leverage these existing investments to provide the dedicated personnel and computational power that are absolutely essential for a project of this ambition and scale.",,
ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_05,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Mapping Conserved and Tumor-Specific Metabolic Vulnerabilities through Synthesis of Pan-Cancer Multi-Omics Data,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, but the sheer diversity of tumors has made it difficult to distinguish between universal metabolic dependencies and those specific to a given cancer type or genetic background. This project will create a comprehensive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas by synthesizing multi-omics and clinical data from public repositories, including TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC. The working group, with expertise in cancer biology, metabolism, bioinformatics, and systems modeling, will develop a unified pipeline to process and integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data from over 20,000 tumor samples. Using this integrated dataset, we will employ genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs) and machine learning to: 1) Construct context-specific metabolic models for every major cancer subtype; 2) Identify a core set of metabolic reactions and pathways that are consistently dysregulated across most cancers, representing robust therapeutic targets; 3) Uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities that are linked to specific driver mutations or tissue-of-origin effects; and 4) Correlate metabolic phenotypes with clinical outcomes and drug response data. This community-scale synthesis will generate a powerful resource for the field, providing a systems-level view of cancer metabolism that can guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies.",,"Background And Significance

The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a foundational hallmark of cancer, enabling the rapid proliferation and survival of tumor cells in diverse microenvironments. First observed by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, this phenomenon, characterized by elevated glucose uptake and lactate fermentation even in the presence of oxygen, is now understood to be part of a much broader metabolic rewiring that affects pathways involving amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides. This metabolic plasticity provides cancer cells with the necessary building blocks for biomass, the energy currency (ATP), and the redox potential (NADPH) required to sustain uncontrolled growth and combat oxidative stress. Consequently, the enzymes and transporters that orchestrate this reprogramming represent a promising, yet largely untapped, class of therapeutic targets. Despite decades of research, our ability to therapeutically exploit cancer metabolism has been hampered by the profound metabolic heterogeneity observed across and within tumor types. While some metabolic dependencies, such as the reliance on glycolysis, appear widespread, others are highly context-specific, dictated by the tumor's tissue of origin, its unique repertoire of driver mutations (e.g., IDH1, KRAS, MYC), and the specific nutrient conditions of the tumor microenvironment. This complexity raises a critical question for the field: which metabolic vulnerabilities are conserved across most cancers, representing potential broad-spectrum targets, and which are unique to specific cancer subtypes, offering opportunities for precision medicine? Answering this question requires a systems-level, pan-cancer approach that has, until now, been infeasible. Previous studies have provided valuable but fragmented insights. Landmark pan-cancer analyses, primarily from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, have successfully mapped the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of cancer, but they often lack the integrated proteomic and metabolomic data necessary to directly infer metabolic function. Studies focused on specific cancer types have successfully linked genetic drivers to metabolic phenotypes, such as the role of VHL loss in clear cell renal carcinoma or IDH1/2 mutations in glioma, but these findings are not easily generalizable. More recent efforts have begun to apply computational modeling, such as genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), to predict metabolic states from transcriptomic data. However, these studies have typically been limited to a single cancer type, a single data modality (transcriptomics), or have used inconsistent data processing methods, preventing robust cross-cancer comparisons. A significant gap in current knowledge is the absence of a unified, multi-modal framework to systematically map the metabolic landscape across the full spectrum of human cancers. We lack a comprehensive resource that integrates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics from a large cohort of tumors to build predictive models of metabolic function. This project is both important and timely because it directly addresses this gap by leveraging an unprecedented opportunity. The recent maturation and public release of massive, complementary datasets from consortia like TCGA, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) make such a synthesis possible for the first time. Concurrently, advances in computational systems biology, including sophisticated algorithms for building context-specific GEMs and powerful machine learning techniques, provide the analytical tools required to extract meaningful biological insights from these complex, high-dimensional datasets. By creating a Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas, this project will move beyond single-gene, single-pathway analyses to provide a holistic view of cancer metabolism, distinguishing universal principles from context-dependent rules and generating a wealth of testable hypotheses to guide the next generation of metabolic cancer therapies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is designed to systematically dissect the complexity of cancer metabolism through a large-scale data synthesis approach. Our research is structured around four central aims, each addressing a critical question and driven by a testable hypothesis. The overarching goal is to create a durable resource that transforms our understanding of metabolic reprogramming in cancer and provides a rational basis for therapeutic development.

**Aim 1: To construct a comprehensive, integrated Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas and a corresponding suite of context-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).**
*   **Research Question:** Can disparate public multi-omics datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) be harmonized into a unified computational resource capable of accurately modeling the metabolic state of distinct cancer subtypes?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a standardized bioinformatics pipeline can process and integrate data from TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC for over 20,000 tumors, and that this integrated data can be used with established algorithms (e.g., tINIT) to construct high-fidelity, context-specific GEMs for each of the 33 major cancer types represented in TCGA.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The primary deliverable will be the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas, a publicly accessible resource containing harmonized multi-omics data and over 30 cancer-specific GEMs. These models will serve as in silico platforms for simulating metabolic functions.
*   **Validation:** The predictive accuracy of our constructed GEMs will be rigorously validated. We will compare model predictions of gene essentiality for cell growth against experimental data from large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens available in the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). A high correlation between our in silico predictions and in vitro experimental results will validate the biological relevance of our models.

**Aim 2: To identify a core set of conserved metabolic reactions and pathways that represent pan-cancer vulnerabilities.**
*   **Research Question:** Are there specific metabolic enzymes or pathways that are consistently essential for proliferation across a majority of human cancers, regardless of their genetic background or tissue of origin?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a systematic in silico comparison of reaction essentiality across all our cancer-specific GEMs will reveal a 'core cancer metabolome'—a set of metabolic reactions whose inhibition is predicted to be lethal to most cancer types. We predict this core set will be enriched for specific pathways, such as nucleotide synthesis and redox balance.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A ranked and annotated list of high-confidence, conserved metabolic targets. This list will provide a data-driven foundation for developing broad-spectrum metabolic therapies.
*   **Validation:** The predicted pan-cancer essential genes corresponding to our core reactions will be cross-referenced with DepMap data. We expect our top candidates to show strong negative median dependency scores across hundreds of cancer cell lines, providing independent experimental validation of their widespread importance.

**Aim 3: To uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities dictated by genetic drivers and tissue of origin.**
*   **Research Question:** How do specific oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, PIK3CA, IDH1) and cellular context (e.g., liver vs. brain) create unique, targetable metabolic dependencies?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that machine learning models, trained on the multi-omics features of our Atlas, can accurately predict tumor-specific metabolic dependencies. For instance, we predict that models will learn to associate KRAS mutations with an increased reliance on non-canonical glutamine metabolism and VHL mutations with dependencies on pathways regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A predictive map linking genomic and transcriptomic features to specific metabolic liabilities. This will generate novel, testable hypotheses for precision oncology strategies.
*   **Validation:** We will validate our model's predictions against established, literature-curated examples of context-specific metabolic dependencies. Furthermore, we will perform case studies on specific cancer subtypes, comparing our model's predictions with published experimental data for those subtypes.

**Aim 4: To identify novel metabolic signatures ('metabotypes') that correlate with clinical outcomes and therapeutic response.**
*   **Research Question:** Can the comprehensive metabolic flux profiles predicted by our models be used to stratify patients into subgroups with distinct clinical prognoses or sensitivities to treatment?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that unsupervised clustering of the predicted metabolic flux maps from thousands of individual tumors will reveal novel patient subgroups, or 'metabotypes,' that are not discernible from genomic data alone. We further hypothesize that these metabotypes will be significantly associated with clinical variables such as overall survival, disease-free survival, and, where data is available, response to chemotherapy or targeted agents.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A set of validated metabolic biomarkers for patient prognosis and treatment stratification. This could inform the design of future clinical trials for metabolic drugs.
*   **Validation:** The prognostic significance of our identified metabotypes will be tested using standard survival analysis techniques (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models) on the clinical data associated with the tumor samples. We will use a train-test split methodology to ensure the robustness of our findings and avoid overfitting.

Methods And Approach

This project will execute a systematic, multi-stage research plan that is entirely computational and leverages only publicly available data, perfectly aligning with the research call's focus on data synthesis. Our approach integrates state-of-the-art bioinformatics, systems biology modeling, and machine learning.

**Data Acquisition and Harmonization**
Our primary data sources will be three major cancer research consortia: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). We will systematically download and curate the following data types for over 20,000 tumor samples and their available matched-normal controls across more than 30 distinct cancer types:
*   **Genomics:** Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) from whole-exome sequencing (WES) in MAF format, and somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) from array-based platforms.
*   **Transcriptomics:** Gene expression levels (RNA-Seq) as raw counts and normalized TPM/FPKM values.
*   **Proteomics:** Protein abundance data from mass spectrometry-based platforms, primarily available through CPTAC for a subset of TCGA cohorts.
*   **Metabolomics:** Relative metabolite abundance data, where available from specific TCGA/CPTAC studies.
*   **Clinical Data:** Patient demographics, tumor stage, grade, survival data (overall and progression-free), and treatment history.

A robust and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline will be developed using Snakemake or Nextflow workflow management systems. This pipeline will perform all harmonization steps: aligning data to the GRCh38 human reference genome, standardizing gene identifiers, applying consistent normalization methods (e.g., TMM for RNA-Seq counts), and using algorithms like ComBat-seq to mitigate batch effects arising from different sequencing centers or platforms. The final output will be a unified, analysis-ready data matrix, forming the core of our Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas.

**Aim 1: Construction of Context-Specific Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs)**
We will use the COBRA (Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis) framework, a widely accepted standard in systems biology. Starting with the most comprehensive human metabolic reconstruction, Recon3D, as a template, we will generate context-specific models for each of the 33 TCGA cancer types. The tINIT (Task-driven Integrative Network Inference for Tissues) algorithm will be employed for this task. tINIT is particularly well-suited as it integrates transcriptomic and proteomic data to prune the generic network, retaining only those reactions supported by expression evidence in a given cancer type. It also ensures the resulting models can perform essential metabolic functions (tasks) known to occur in human cells, such as ATP production and synthesis of all biomass components. This process will yield a collection of high-quality, curated GEMs, each representing the active metabolic network of a specific cancer.

**Aim 2 & 3: Identification of Metabolic Vulnerabilities**
To identify vulnerabilities, we will perform in silico gene deletion simulations on each cancer-specific GEM. Using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we will predict the optimal distribution of metabolic fluxes that maximizes a defined biological objective, typically the production of biomass, which serves as a proxy for cell proliferation. We will then systematically simulate the knockout of each metabolic gene in the model by constraining the flux through the corresponding reaction(s) to zero. The effect on the maximal biomass production rate will be calculated. Genes whose knockout leads to a significant reduction in biomass production will be classified as essential for that cancer type.
*   **For Aim 2 (Conserved Vulnerabilities):** We will perform a meta-analysis across all cancer models. A gene/reaction will be defined as a 'core' vulnerability if it is predicted to be essential in a high percentage (>80%) of the cancer types analyzed. Statistical enrichment analyses will be used to identify pathways that are consistently essential across cancers.
*   **For Aim 3 (Specific Vulnerabilities):** We will build a machine learning framework to link genomic features to metabolic dependencies. For each gene, we will create a vector of its predicted essentiality scores across all tumor samples. We will then train supervised machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict these essentiality scores using somatic mutations, CNAs, and gene expression levels as input features. Model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP values) will be used to identify the specific genomic alterations that are most predictive of a dependency on a given metabolic pathway.

**Aim 4: Correlation with Clinical Outcomes**
For each individual tumor sample with sufficient data, we will generate a personalized metabolic flux map using its transcriptomic profile to constrain the relevant cancer-type GEM. This will result in a high-dimensional vector of predicted reaction fluxes for each tumor. We will apply unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization, UMAP followed by k-means) to this flux matrix to identify recurrent metabolic states, or 'metabotypes,' across the pan-cancer cohort. We will then use Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test to determine if these metabotypes are associated with significant differences in patient survival. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to assess the independent prognostic value of these metabotypes while controlling for known clinical covariates like tumor stage and patient age.

**Timeline and Milestones**
*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Finalize working group composition. Develop and validate the data harmonization pipeline. Acquire and process all data from TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC. Construct and validate the first set of 10 cancer-specific GEMs. Hold kickoff working group meeting.
*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Complete construction of all 33 cancer-specific GEMs. Perform pan-cancer analysis to identify core metabolic vulnerabilities (Aim 2). Develop, train, and validate machine learning models for predicting context-specific dependencies (Aim 3). Release the integrated data atlas and models publicly. Hold mid-project meeting and trainee workshop.
*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36):** Conduct clinical correlation analyses to identify prognostic metabotypes (Aim 4). Synthesize all findings, prepare manuscripts for publication, and develop the user-friendly web portal for data dissemination. Hold final working group meeting to plan future collaborations.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This community-scale synthesis project is poised to generate transformative outcomes and exert a significant, lasting impact on the fields of cancer biology, metabolism, and computational oncology. Our deliverables are designed to be both scientifically insightful and practically useful, providing a durable resource that will catalyze research and discovery long after the project's completion.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field**
1.  **The Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas:** The primary outcome will be a first-of-its-kind, comprehensive resource that unifies multi-omics and clinical data for over 20,000 tumors, specifically curated for metabolic analysis. This Atlas will be an invaluable tool, enabling researchers worldwide to explore metabolic gene expression, its association with genomic alterations, and its clinical relevance across the full spectrum of human cancers without the prohibitive overhead of data harmonization.
2.  **A Compendium of Cancer-Specific Metabolic Models:** We will deliver over 30 high-quality, validated genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), one for each major cancer type. This collection will empower the community to perform in silico experiments, test hypotheses about metabolic function in specific cancer contexts, and predict drug targets in a cost-effective and rapid manner.
3.  **A Prioritized Catalog of Metabolic Therapeutic Targets:** Our analysis will produce a data-driven, prioritized list of both conserved and context-specific metabolic vulnerabilities. The identification of core, pan-cancer dependencies will provide a strong rationale for developing broad-spectrum metabolic inhibitors. Conversely, the map linking specific genetic drivers to unique metabolic liabilities will be a critical resource for advancing precision oncology and designing biomarker-driven clinical trials.
4.  **Novel Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers:** By identifying 'metabotypes'—patient subgroups defined by their metabolic activity—we expect to uncover novel biomarkers that can predict patient survival and potential response to therapy. These findings could lead to new diagnostic tools for patient stratification, improving clinical decision-making.

**Broader Impacts and Alignment with Research Call**
This project is perfectly aligned with the funding organization's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams for data synthesis. 
*   **Stimulating Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** Our working group intentionally brings together experts in cancer biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, systems modeling, and machine learning. This transdisciplinary environment is essential for tackling the complexity of cancer metabolism and will foster novel analytical strategies that none of our individual labs could develop alone.
*   **Training the Next Generation:** Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are central to this project. They will receive hands-on training at the intersection of big data analytics, computational biology, and cancer research. Through collaborative work and dedicated workshops, they will become part of the future data-savvy scientific workforce.
*   **Adherence to Open Science Principles:** We are deeply committed to open and reproducible science. All analysis pipelines and code will be version-controlled and shared on GitHub. The harmonized data, metabolic models, and key results will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Synapse, Zenodo) and made accessible through a user-friendly web portal. Our findings will be published in open-access journals.
*   **Advancing Therapeutic Development:** The ultimate impact of this research lies in its potential to accelerate the development of new cancer therapies. By providing a rich, pre-clinical platform for target discovery and hypothesis generation, our work will de-risk and guide the efforts of academic and pharmaceutical researchers, potentially shortening the timeline for bringing novel metabolic drugs to the clinic.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-faceted. We will publish our findings in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals and present at key international conferences (e.g., AACR Annual Meeting, Gordon Research Conference on Cancer Metabolism). The cornerstone of our dissemination effort will be the creation of an interactive web portal. This portal will allow users to visualize data from the Atlas, query the predicted vulnerabilities of specific genes in different cancers, and download the metabolic models. We will also host a virtual workshop to train the broader research community on how to use these resources. The long-term vision is for the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas to become a living resource, periodically updated with new public datasets, and to serve as a foundational component of a future 'Cancer Cell Map' initiative. The collaborations forged in this working group will form the basis for future grant applications aimed at experimentally validating our top computational predictions.

Understanding the general principles of these conflicts is crucial for predicting and combating emerging viral threats. This project will synthesize all publicly available data on host-virus interactions to build a unified, cross-species map of this evolutionary battlefield. A collaborative team of virologists, immunologists, evolutionary biologists, and network scientists will integrate: 1) Host-virus protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from numerous studies and organisms; 2) Transcriptomic data (e.g., from GEO) detailing the host cellular response to infection across a wide range of viruses; and 3) Protein structural data to analyze the physical interfaces of host-virus interactions. By analyzing this integrated network, we will: a) Identify 'host defense hubs'—cellular proteins that are frequently targeted by diverse viruses, highlighting their central role in innate immunity; b) Uncover conserved viral strategies for manipulating these hubs; and c) Use signatures of rapid evolution (antagonistic co-evolution) in both host and viral proteins to pinpoint the high-conflict interfaces. This synthesis will reveal the fundamental rules of engagement in host-virus conflicts, creating a framework for predicting which cellular pathways a novel virus is likely to target and informing the design of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.",,"Background And Significance

The relationship between viruses and their hosts is a defining example of antagonistic co-evolution, a relentless molecular arms race that has shaped cellular biology and driven organismal diversity for billions of years. Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, must commandeer the host cellular machinery for their replication, while hosts have evolved elaborate multi-layered defense systems to detect and eliminate them. This dynamic conflict has left indelible signatures in the genomes of both entities. Understanding the fundamental principles governing these interactions is not merely an academic exercise; it is a critical necessity for global health, as underscored by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the persistent threat of emerging viral pathogens. The ability to predict viral mechanisms, identify host vulnerabilities, and develop broad-spectrum therapeutics hinges on a deep, generalizable knowledge of the host-virus battlefield. 

Over the past two decades, high-throughput technologies have generated a wealth of data detailing the molecular intricacies of these conflicts. Large-scale screens using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) have mapped the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for numerous individual viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2. These studies, exemplified by the work of Gordon et al. (2020) on the SARS-CoV-2 interactome, have been instrumental in identifying host factors required for viral replication and potential targets for drug repurposing. Concurrently, the proliferation of next-generation sequencing has led to an explosion of transcriptomic data, deposited in public repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). These datasets provide a dynamic view of the host cellular response to infection, revealing the large-scale transcriptional reprogramming that viruses induce. Complementing this, structural biology has resolved the atomic details of many key host-virus protein complexes, offering mechanistic insights into how viral proteins subvert host functions.

Despite this progress, our understanding remains fragmented and largely virus-centric. Current knowledge is siloed within studies of single viruses or viral families, preventing the identification of deeply conserved, universal principles. Public databases that collate this information, such as BioGRID and VirusMentha, are invaluable resources but do not provide an integrated, cross-species synthesis. A major gap in the field is the lack of a unified framework that integrates interactomic, transcriptomic, and evolutionary data across a wide phylogenetic range of viruses and hosts. We do not yet have a systematic answer to fundamental questions: Are there universal 'choke points' in the host cell that are targeted by most viruses? Have diverse viruses convergently evolved similar molecular tools to disable these defenses? Can we use evolutionary signatures to pinpoint the most critical battlegrounds at the molecular level? Current approaches, typically confined to individual labs, lack the scale and multidisciplinary expertise required to tackle these questions. This project is timely because we have reached a critical mass of public data and a maturation of computational tools in network biology and comparative genomics. By synthesizing this disparate data, we can move beyond isolated case studies to uncover the general 'rules of engagement' in host-virus conflicts. This research will transform our understanding of innate immunity and viral pathogenesis, creating a powerful predictive framework to combat not only existing viruses but also the emergent threats of the future.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is designed to systematically uncover the conserved principles of host-virus molecular conflicts through a large-scale synthesis of public data. Our central goal is to build and analyze a unified, cross-species interactome to identify the universal choke points in host defense and the convergent strategies viruses use to overcome them. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research aims, each guided by testable hypotheses.

**Aim 1: Identify Conserved Host Defense Hubs.** This aim seeks to define the core set of host proteins that represent the central battlegrounds in the host-virus arms race.
*   **Research Question:** Are there specific host proteins or pathways that are consistently and preferentially targeted by a wide range of evolutionarily diverse viruses across different host species?
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A discrete subset of host proteins, which we term 'host defense hubs,' function as central nodes in intrinsic and innate immunity and are therefore convergently targeted by numerous, unrelated viruses. We predict these hubs will exhibit a significantly higher number of viral protein interactors (network degree) in our integrated interactome compared to other host proteins. Furthermore, we predict these proteins will be significantly enriched for functions related to antiviral signaling (e.g., interferon pathways), protein degradation (e.g., ubiquitination), and translation regulation.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** The functional importance of these hubs is reflected in their transcriptional response during infection. We hypothesize that the genes encoding these hubs will be consistently and significantly dysregulated across a broad array of viral infections. We predict that a meta-analysis of public transcriptomic data will reveal a 'core viral response signature' of differentially expressed genes that significantly overlaps with the interaction hubs identified in Hypothesis 1a.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will test these hypotheses by constructing a comprehensive host-virus PPI network and applying network-theoretic statistics to identify high-degree nodes. We will perform functional enrichment analysis on these nodes. Concurrently, we will conduct a large-scale meta-analysis of infection transcriptomes from GEO. The statistical significance of the overlap between the two sets of identified genes will be rigorously assessed using permutation tests.

**Aim 2: Uncover Conserved Viral Evasion Strategies.** This aim focuses on the viral side of the conflict, investigating whether different viruses have evolved similar molecular solutions to the common problem of subverting host hubs.
*   **Research Question:** Do phylogenetically distinct viruses evolve similar molecular strategies, such as structural mimicry or motif mimicry, to antagonize the same host defense hubs?
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Viruses from different families have convergently evolved proteins with similar three-dimensional structures or short linear motifs (SLiMs) that bind to the same functional interface on a given host defense hub. We predict that structural clustering of all viral proteins targeting a specific hub will reveal groups of non-homologous proteins with shared structural folds. Similarly, we predict that motif discovery algorithms will identify conserved SLiMs that mimic host motifs (e.g., SUMO-interacting motifs, degrons) used to hijack cellular machinery.
*   **Testing and Validation:** For each identified host hub, we will perform all-by-all structural comparisons of its viral interactors using tools like DALI. We will search for conserved motifs using the MEME suite and compare them to the ELM database. The significance of these findings will be assessed against null models of random protein sets.

**Aim 3: Pinpoint High-Conflict Interfaces through Evolutionary Analysis.** This aim will use signatures of natural selection to identify the precise molecular interfaces under the strongest co-evolutionary pressure.
*   **Research Question:** Can we identify the specific amino acid residues at the host-virus interface that are the focus of the molecular arms race?
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** Host defense hubs and their viral antagonists are engaged in an ongoing evolutionary conflict, which leaves a detectable signature of rapid evolution (positive selection). We predict that orthologs of host hub proteins across mammals will exhibit significantly elevated dN/dS ratios (non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates) compared to genome-wide averages. The viral proteins targeting these hubs will show similar signatures of rapid evolution across related viral strains or species.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** The specific residues under positive selection are not randomly distributed but are concentrated at the physical interface of the host-virus protein complex. We predict that when these rapidly evolving sites are mapped onto 3D structures, they will cluster significantly at the protein-protein interaction surface, pinpointing the high-conflict zones.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will use codon-based models of evolution (e.g., PAML, HyPhy) to identify sites under positive selection in both host and viral gene alignments. We will then use structural data from the PDB and AlphaFold DB to map these sites and test for their spatial clustering at the interface using statistical tests, validating our predictions against known functional data from mutagenesis studies in the literature.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed through a phased, computationally-driven approach that integrates diverse public datasets into a unified analytical framework. Our methodology is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and transparent, adhering to open science principles. The project is structured into three main phases: 1) Data Acquisition and Integration, 2) Multi-modal Network Analysis, and 3) Dissemination.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Integration (Year 1)**
This foundational phase focuses on building a comprehensive, multi-layered database. We will develop a robust, automated pipeline using Snakemake to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future updates.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically aggregate data from multiple public repositories. 
    *   **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Data:** We will query major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, MINT, and VirusMentha to collect all available host-virus and host-host PPIs. Data will be filtered to retain only interactions supported by direct experimental evidence, and a confidence score will be assigned based on the detection method and number of publications.
    *   **Transcriptomic Data:** We will perform a systematic search of NCBI GEO and ArrayExpress to identify all RNA-seq and microarray datasets related to viral infection of mammalian and avian cells/tissues. We will curate associated metadata (host, virus, cell type, time point, etc.) into a standardized format.
    *   **Structural Data:** We will download all experimentally determined structures of host-virus protein complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For proteins lacking experimental structures, we will retrieve high-quality predicted models from the AlphaFold Database.
    *   **Genomic and Proteomic Sequence Data:** We will source canonical protein and coding sequences from UniProt and Ensembl. Orthology relationships across host species will be obtained from Ensembl Compara and OrthoDB.
*   **Data Harmonization and Integration:** A critical challenge is data heterogeneity. Our pipeline will map all gene and protein identifiers to a common namespace (Ensembl and UniProtKB). Raw RNA-seq data (FASTQ files) will be processed through a standardized pipeline (FASTQC, Trimmomatic, STAR alignment, featureCounts) to generate comparable expression matrices. All integrated data—PPIs, gene expression profiles, structural information, and evolutionary relationships—will be loaded into a Neo4j graph database. This structure allows for efficient and complex queries across different data types, for example, 'Find all host proteins that interact with at least three viral families and are consistently upregulated during infection.'

**Phase 2: Analytical Approach (Years 2-3)**
With the integrated database in place, we will execute our three research aims.
*   **Aim 1 (Hub Identification):** We will construct a host-virus interaction network and use the NetworkX Python library to calculate centrality metrics (degree, betweenness) for all host proteins. 'Host defense hubs' will be defined as proteins in the top 5% of degree centrality that are targeted by viruses from at least three distinct families. We will perform functional enrichment analysis on this set of hubs using g:Profiler against GO, KEGG, and Reactome databases. For the transcriptomic analysis, we will use the R package 'metafor' to perform a random-effects meta-analysis on the processed expression data, identifying genes with a consistent and significant change in expression across diverse infections. The statistical significance of the overlap between network hubs and the core transcriptional response will be evaluated using a hypergeometric test.
*   **Aim 2 (Strategy Identification):** For each major host hub, we will collect its viral interactors. We will use TM-align to perform all-vs-all structural alignments and hierarchical clustering to identify groups of viral proteins with convergent structural folds. In parallel, we will use the MEME algorithm to search for conserved short linear motifs (SLiMs) in the sequences of these viral interactors. Discovered motifs will be scanned against the ELM database to identify potential instances of host mimicry. 
*   **Aim 3 (Evolutionary Analysis):** For each host hub, we will create codon alignments of its orthologs from ~50 mammalian species. We will use the CodeML program in the PAML package (and the BUSTED method in HyPhy for robustness) to fit models of codon evolution and identify genes under positive selection. The Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood (REL) method will be used to identify specific codons (sites) under episodic positive selection. For viral protein families, a similar approach will be applied. We will then develop a Python script to map these identified sites onto corresponding PDB or AlphaFold structures. A permutation-based statistical test will be implemented to determine if these sites are significantly closer to the host-virus interaction interface than expected by chance.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Months 1-12:** Complete data acquisition pipeline development and populate the Neo4j database. **Milestone:** Public release of the integrated Host-Virus Interaction Database (HVIDB).
*   **Months 13-18:** Complete Aim 1 analysis. **Milestone:** Manuscript draft identifying and characterizing conserved host defense hubs.
*   **Months 19-24:** Complete Aim 2 analysis. **Milestone:** Manuscript draft detailing convergent viral evasion strategies.
*   **Months 25-30:** Complete Aim 3 analysis. **Milestone:** Manuscript draft on the co-evolutionary dynamics at host-virus interfaces.
*   **Months 31-36:** Synthesize all findings, finalize publications, and host a dissemination workshop. **Milestone:** Final project report and public release of all analysis workflows and code.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate significant outcomes that will advance the fields of virology, immunology, and evolutionary medicine, with tangible broader impacts on public health and scientific training. Our work is designed not only to answer fundamental scientific questions but also to create lasting resources and a collaborative framework for the research community.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Unified Community Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the Host-Virus Interaction Database (HVIDB), the first resource of its kind to integrate interactomic, transcriptomic, structural, and evolutionary data across a broad range of viruses and hosts. By making this database and its query interface publicly available, we will provide an invaluable tool for hypothesis generation and data exploration for the entire research community, lowering the barrier to entry for complex synthesis research.
2.  **Discovery of Fundamental Principles:** Our analysis will move beyond the specifics of individual viruses to reveal the general 'rules of engagement' in host-virus conflicts. The identification of a core set of 'host defense hubs' will provide a functional roadmap of the most critical cellular nodes for antiviral defense. This will fundamentally reshape our understanding of innate immunity, highlighting which pathways are under the greatest evolutionary pressure from viral pathogens.
3.  **A Novel Methodological Framework:** We will establish and validate a powerful, multi-modal analytical framework for studying host-pathogen co-evolution. This integrative approach, combining network biology, comparative genomics, and structural bioinformatics, will serve as a template for future synthesis projects, applicable not only to viruses but also to other pathogens like bacteria and parasites.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Informing Therapeutic Development:** A key challenge in antiviral therapy is the rapid evolution of viruses, leading to drug resistance. Our project will identify conserved host defense hubs that are essential for the replication of many different viruses. These host proteins represent prime targets for host-directed therapies. Such therapies, by targeting less mutable host factors, are expected to be more broad-spectrum and less prone to viral escape, offering a powerful strategy against both existing and emerging viruses.
2.  **Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness:** The principles uncovered by this research will create a predictive framework for understanding novel pathogens. When a new virus emerges, its proteome can be rapidly analyzed for structural or sequence features (e.g., motifs identified in Aim 2) that suggest an interaction with our identified host hubs. This will allow for the rapid generation of testable hypotheses about its pathogenic mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities, accelerating the research response during a public health crisis.
3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This project is inherently multidisciplinary and collaborative, providing an ideal training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in computational biology, big data management (SQL/graph databases), bioinformatics pipeline development, network analysis, and evolutionary genetics. This cross-training is essential for the future biomedical workforce and directly aligns with the funding call's goal of developing data-savvy researchers.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
We are fully committed to the principles of open and reproducible science. All analysis scripts, computational workflows, and pipelines will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub, accompanied by detailed documentation and Jupyter Notebooks. The HVIDB will be released publicly in Year 1 and updated throughout the project. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals, with at least three major publications anticipated from our three research aims. Findings will be presented at key international conferences, such as the American Society for Virology (ASV) and the International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB). In the final year, we will host a virtual workshop to train the broader community on how to use our database and analytical tools, ensuring the long-term impact and utility of our work.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_07,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,The Epigenetic Echo: Identifying Conserved Mechanisms of Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance Across Species,"The concept that an organism's experiences can induce epigenetic changes inherited by subsequent generations is a revolutionary, yet controversial, idea in biology. A key barrier to progress is the lack of a systematic, cross-species synthesis of the available evidence. This project will form a working group to perform the first large-scale meta-analysis of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI) by integrating public data from diverse model organisms. The team, with expertise in epigenetics, developmental biology, toxicology, and bioinformatics, will collate and re-analyze datasets from C. elegans, Drosophila, mice, and plants where parental generations were exposed to environmental stimuli (e.g., diet, stress, toxicants) and epigenetic changes were profiled in unexposed F2 or F3 descendants. We will integrate data on DNA methylation, histone modifications (ChIP-seq), and small RNA populations (sRNA-seq). The primary goal is to search for conserved epigenetic signatures and molecular pathways that mediate TGEI. By comparing results across different species, stimuli, and inherited phenotypes, we aim to identify universal principles, such as the potential role of specific small RNA pathways or histone marks in carrying epigenetic information through the germline. This project will bring clarity to a contentious field, establish a rigorous framework for future studies, and address the fundamental question of how environmental information can be encoded and transmitted across generations.",,"Background And Significance

The inheritance of acquired characteristics, a concept long associated with Lamarck, has been re-examined through the modern lens of epigenetics. While genetic inheritance via DNA sequence is the cornerstone of heredity, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI) proposes a parallel system where environmental information is encoded in molecular marks on top of the DNA and transmitted to subsequent, unexposed generations. This phenomenon challenges the Weismann barrier, which posits a strict separation between the somatic and germline cells, and has profound implications for evolutionary biology, agriculture, and human health. The field has gained significant traction over the past two decades, with compelling evidence emerging from diverse model organisms. In mammals, studies have shown that parental diet, stress, or toxicant exposure can influence offspring metabolism, behavior, and disease susceptibility for multiple generations. For instance, Skinner et al. demonstrated that F0 exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin induced reproductive defects in male rats that persisted to the F3 generation, correlated with altered DNA methylation in sperm. In invertebrates, the mechanisms appear distinct but equally potent. Work in *C. elegans* by Rechavi and others has provided strong evidence for small RNAs as carriers of heritable information, capable of transmitting learned behaviors like viral avoidance for several generations. Similarly, studies in *Drosophila* have shown that parental diet can induce chromatin state changes that are inherited by offspring, affecting their metabolic health. In plants, phenomena like vernalization, where cold exposure induces flowering competence, are mediated by heritable changes in histone modifications, specifically H3K27me3 at the FLC locus. Despite these compelling examples, the field of TGEI remains highly controversial and fragmented. A primary limitation is the lack of reproducibility and generalizability. Findings are often specific to a particular model organism, environmental stimulus, sex, and epigenetic mechanism studied. For every positive report, there are studies that fail to replicate the effect, leading to skepticism about the prevalence and significance of TGEI. A major biological hurdle is the extensive epigenetic reprogramming that occurs in the primordial germ cells and the early embryo, which is thought to erase the vast majority of epigenetic marks to ensure totipotency. For TGEI to occur, specific information must somehow escape or be re-established after these reprogramming waves. The molecular mechanisms governing this escape remain one of the central puzzles in the field. The current state of knowledge is a mosaic of intriguing but disconnected findings. We lack a systematic understanding of whether common principles govern TGEI across the tree of life. Are there specific 'carrier' molecules, such as small RNAs, that are universally employed? Are certain genes or genomic regions, like transposable elements, particularly susceptible to heritable epigenetic modification? Do different environmental stimuli converge on common molecular pathways in the germline? Answering these questions is impossible from single-lab studies alone. This research is critically important and timely because we are at an inflection point. The proliferation of public 'omics' data archives (e.g., GEO, SRA) now provides an unprecedented opportunity to address these questions through large-scale data synthesis. For the first time, it is feasible to collate, re-analyze, and integrate dozens of TGEI studies under a single, harmonized analytical framework. Such a community-scale effort, as proposed here, can transcend the limitations of individual studies to identify robust, conserved patterns. By synthesizing the existing evidence, this project will bring much-needed clarity to a contentious field, resolve long-standing debates, and establish a rigorous foundation for a new generation of mechanistic, hypothesis-driven experimental research into how the environment's echo is heard across generations.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research project is designed to move the field of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI) from a collection of case studies to a synthetic, principles-based science. Our overarching goal is to determine if conserved molecular signatures and pathways mediate the transmission of environmentally induced epigenetic states across generations. To achieve this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes.

**Research Question 1: Are there conserved epigenetic signatures at the chromatin level (DNA methylation and histone modifications) associated with TGEI across diverse species and environmental stimuli?**
The stability of chromatin states through meiosis and fertilization is a key requirement for TGEI. While global reprogramming erases most marks, some loci may escape this process. We will investigate if these 'escapee' loci share common features across species.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** TGEI is mediated by the incomplete erasure of repressive histone marks (e.g., H3K9me3, H3K27me3) at specific orthologous genes or transposable elements (TEs) in the germline. We predict that a meta-analysis of ChIP-seq datasets from F2/F3 descendants will reveal a statistically significant enrichment of these marks at a conserved set of genes, particularly those involved in developmental plasticity, stress response, and metabolism. We further predict that TEs, known targets of epigenetic silencing, will be hotspots for heritable changes.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** Heritable changes in DNA methylation are not randomly distributed but are targeted to specific genomic contexts that are predisposed to resist reprogramming, such as CpG islands in gene promoters, enhancer regions, or imprinted control regions. We predict that a cross-species comparison of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data will identify conserved differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in F2/F3 descendants. These conserved DMRs will be significantly associated with orthologous genes whose expression is known to be altered in TGEI paradigms and will correlate with the observed heritable phenotypes.

**Research Question 2: Do small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) represent a conserved vector for transmitting environmental information across generations, and do they target conserved molecular pathways?**
sRNAs are mobile, can target specific sequences, and have been strongly implicated in TGEI, especially in nematodes. We aim to determine if their role is a universal principle.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** A specific repertoire of sRNAs (e.g., piRNAs, endo-siRNAs) is consistently altered in the germline of F0-exposed parents and remains dysregulated in unexposed F2/F3 descendants across multiple species. We predict that our harmonized re-analysis of sRNA-seq datasets will identify a core set of differentially expressed sRNAs that are common to multiple TGEI paradigms. These sRNAs may be orthologous in sequence or belong to conserved biogenesis pathways.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** These heritable sRNAs guide epigenetic modifications by targeting homologous sequences in the genome, thereby regulating the expression of genes in conserved biological pathways. We predict that computational target prediction for the identified heritable sRNAs will reveal a significant enrichment for orthologous genes involved in chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, or pathways thematically linked to the initial F0 environmental stimulus (e.g., nutrient sensing pathways for dietary exposures).

**Research Question 3: Is there a unifying 'genomic logic' that determines the susceptibility of genes and pathways to TGEI?**
We seek to identify the common features of genes that are targets of TGEI, moving beyond the identity of the epigenetic mark to the characteristics of the underlying genomic locus.
*   **Hypothesis 3:** Genes susceptible to TGEI are not a random subset of the genome but share intrinsic properties, such as being environmentally responsive, having a specific promoter architecture (e.g., bivalent chromatin domains), or being located in genomic regions that are sensitive to environmental insults. We predict that an integrative analysis combining epigenetic data with genomic features will show that genes with heritable epigenetic changes are significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms (e.g., 'response to stimulus'), are flanked by TEs, and exhibit specific chromatin accessibility signatures in the germline. We will test this by building a predictive model to classify genes as 'TGEI-susceptible' or 'TGEI-resistant' based on these features, which we will then validate across different datasets. By systematically testing these hypotheses, this project will deliver a comprehensive, cross-species map of the molecular events underlying TGEI, providing a robust, data-driven framework for understanding non-genetic inheritance.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that leverages the power of a multidisciplinary working group and publicly available data, fully aligning with the research call's requirements. Our approach is organized into three sequential phases, underpinned by a commitment to open and reproducible science.

**Working Group Composition and Collaboration:**
Our team comprises experts in *C. elegans* epigenetics (PI 1), mammalian toxicology and epigenomics (PI 2), plant developmental biology (Collaborator 1), and computational biology/bioinformatics (PI 3). This diversity is essential for navigating the species-specific nuances of the data and for the integrative analysis. The working group will convene for an annual in-person workshop and bi-weekly virtual meetings to ensure tight coordination. A dedicated postdoctoral fellow will serve as the central data scientist, with graduate students from each lab contributing to specific analytical modules.

**Phase 1: Systematic Data Identification, Curation, and Standardization (Months 1-12)**
This foundational phase focuses on building a comprehensive, high-quality database of TGEI studies.
*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI GEO, SRA, and ENA, using a carefully constructed set of keywords (e.g., 'transgenerational', 'intergenerational', 'parental exposure', 'epigenetic inheritance') combined with species names (*C. elegans*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, *Mus musculus*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*) and data types ('ChIP-seq', 'WGBS', 'RRBS', 'sRNA-seq', 'RNA-seq').
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** To ensure rigor, studies will be included only if they meet strict criteria: (1) a documented environmental exposure in the F0 generation; (2) molecular profiling of an unexposed generation (F2 or later to exclude direct gamete exposure); (3) availability of raw sequencing data for both exposed lineages and concurrent controls; (4) detailed metadata describing the experimental design.
*   **Curation and Database Development:** We will develop a structured TGEI database, capturing over 50 metadata fields for each experiment, including stimulus, dose, duration, sex, tissue, developmental stage, and observed phenotype. This manually curated database will be a key deliverable and a valuable community resource, released publicly at the end of Year 1.

**Phase 2: Harmonized Data Processing and Primary Analysis (Months 10-24)**
To enable meaningful comparison across studies, all raw data will be processed through standardized, reproducible pipelines.
*   **Reproducible Pipelines:** We will use the Nextflow workflow management system to create containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipelines for each data type. This ensures that every dataset, regardless of its origin, is analyzed with identical software versions and parameters. All pipelines will be version-controlled and shared on GitHub.
*   **Data-Specific Processing:**
    *   **ChIP-seq:** Reads will be aligned, filtered for quality, and peaks will be called using MACS2. Differential binding analysis will be performed using DiffBind to identify regions with altered histone modifications.
    *   **Bisulfite-seq (WGBS/RRBS):** Reads will be processed with Bismark to align and quantify methylation levels at single-cytosine resolution. Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) will be identified using a tool like methylKit.
    *   **sRNA-seq:** Adapters will be trimmed, and reads will be aligned to the genome and known RNA databases. Expression of sRNA classes (miRNA, piRNA, siRNA) will be quantified, and differential expression will be analyzed with DESeq2.
*   **Quality Control:** A comprehensive QC report (using MultiQC) will be generated for every sample to ensure data quality and identify potential batch effects. Datasets that fail QC will be excluded from the final meta-analysis.

**Phase 3: Integrative, Cross-Species Meta-Analysis (Months 20-36)**
This phase addresses our core research questions by synthesizing the processed data.
*   **Ortholog Mapping:** To compare gene-level effects across species, we will use the Ensembl Compara database to map orthologous genes. This allows us to ask whether the same conserved genes are targeted by TGEI in different species.
*   **Statistical Meta-Analysis:** We will employ formal meta-analysis techniques to combine results from individual studies. For each hypothesis, we will use methods like Fisher's combined probability test or rank-product analysis to identify genes, genomic regions, or sRNAs that show consistent epigenetic changes across multiple experiments. This approach increases statistical power and identifies robust signals over study-specific noise.
*   **Pathway and Network Analysis:** We will use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and tools like Reactome to determine if the genes identified in our meta-analysis fall into conserved biological pathways. This will reveal the functional logic of TGEI.
*   **Integrative Modeling:** To address RQ3, we will integrate multiple data types. We will use machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest classifiers) to identify the genomic and epigenomic features (e.g., proximity to TEs, baseline chromatin state, promoter CpG content) that best predict a gene's susceptibility to heritable epigenetic change.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Launch working group; Finalize data inclusion criteria; Complete systematic data search and curation; Public release of the TGEI study database; Development and validation of analysis pipelines.
*   **Year 2:** Complete harmonized processing of all datasets; Perform within-species meta-analyses; Present preliminary findings at a major conference; Host a training workshop on our pipelines.
*   **Year 3:** Conduct cross-species integrative analyses; Test final hypotheses; Prepare and submit 2-3 primary manuscripts; Publicly release all analysis code, summary data, and a web portal for exploring results.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to the molecular and cellular biosciences by addressing fundamental questions about non-genetic inheritance. The expected outcomes will provide clarity to a contentious field, generate powerful new resources for the community, and have a broad impact on human health and evolutionary biology.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Definitive Synthesis of TGEI Mechanisms:** The primary scientific outcome will be the first large-scale, systematic synthesis of the molecular evidence for TGEI. By integrating data across species, stimuli, and epigenetic layers, we will identify robust, conserved principles of non-genetic inheritance. Our findings will either converge on a set of core mechanisms (e.g., the primacy of sRNA pathways) or demonstrate that TGEI is fundamentally context-dependent and species-specific. Either conclusion will be a major advance, resolving long-standing debates and providing a clear roadmap for future research.
2.  **A High-Confidence Catalog of TGEI Effectors:** We will produce a rigorously vetted, cross-species catalog of candidate genes, pathways, small RNAs, and genomic regions implicated in TGEI. This data-driven resource will move the field beyond single-gene studies, enabling researchers to focus experimental validation on the most promising and conserved molecular players. This will significantly accelerate the pace of discovery and improve the efficient allocation of research funding.
3.  **A Lasting Community Resource and Framework:** A key tangible outcome will be the creation of the TGEI Database and the associated suite of harmonized, open-source analysis pipelines. This platform will serve as an enduring resource for the entire research community, lowering the barrier to entry for labs wishing to perform meta-analyses and ensuring that future TGEI studies can be easily integrated into a common framework. This promotes the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and fosters a more collaborative scientific culture.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Implications for Human Health and Disease:** Our work directly informs the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm. By elucidating the mechanisms through which environmental exposures (e.g., malnutrition, stress, toxicants) can leave a heritable molecular memory, we provide a foundation for understanding how disease risk (e.g., for obesity, diabetes, neurodevelopmental disorders) can be transmitted across generations. This knowledge is critical for developing new strategies for disease prevention and for informing public health policies regarding environmental exposures.
*   **New Perspectives in Evolutionary Biology:** TGEI provides a potential mechanism for rapid adaptation, allowing populations to respond to environmental changes on a faster timescale than is possible through genetic selection alone. Our project will provide the first comprehensive look at the molecular substrates available for this 'soft' inheritance, offering crucial data for evolutionary theorists modeling the interplay between genetic and epigenetic inheritance in evolution.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training vehicle. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellow involved will gain deep, hands-on expertise in data synthesis, computational biology, reproducible research practices, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. We will further amplify this impact by hosting an annual virtual workshop, open to the broader community, to train other researchers in our data synthesis methodologies, thereby fulfilling the call's mandate to develop a data-savvy workforce.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
Our dissemination strategy includes high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at key international conferences, and a dedicated project website that will serve as a portal to all data, tools, and results. Our long-term vision is for this working group to establish a sustainable 'TGEI Atlas'—a living, community-driven resource that is continuously updated as new data becomes available. This project will not only answer critical current questions but will also build the foundation and collaborative network for the future of TGEI research.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_08,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,"A Multi-Scale Atlas of Cellular Senescence Integrating Molecular, Imaging, and Spatial Omics Data","Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest, is a complex emergent phenotype implicated in aging and numerous diseases. However, senescence is highly heterogeneous, and a unified understanding of its core features and context-dependent variations is missing. This project will create a comprehensive, multi-scale 'Senescence Atlas' by synthesizing diverse public data types. A working group of gerontologists, cell biologists, computer vision experts, and computational biologists will integrate: 1) Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data (e.g., from Tabula Muris Senis, ENCODE) to define molecular subtypes of senescent cells; 2) Proteomic data to characterize the composition of the pro-inflammatory Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP); 3) High-resolution imaging data from resources like the Image Data Resource and Cell Image Library to build machine learning models that can identify senescent cells based on their unique morphology; and 4) Emerging spatial transcriptomics datasets to map the interactions between senescent cells and their tissue microenvironments. By integrating these disparate scales of information—from chromatin state to tissue architecture—we will develop a holistic model of senescence. This atlas will serve as a central resource for the aging research community, enabling the identification of robust biomarkers and the development of more precise senolytic therapies.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, is a fundamental biological process with a paradoxical role in health and disease. Initially described as a limit to cellular proliferation in vitro, it is now recognized as a critical tumor suppression mechanism and an essential component of tissue repair and embryonic development. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age is also a major driver of organismal aging and a contributor to a wide range of age-related pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. This dual functionality highlights the complexity and context-dependency of the senescent phenotype, an emergent property arising from intricate molecular networks. The canonical markers used to identify senescent cells—such as senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, expression of cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p21CIP1, and the formation of DNA damage foci—are often inconsistent and lack specificity. Furthermore, a key feature of many senescent cells is the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a complex secretome of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases that can profoundly alter the tissue microenvironment. The composition of the SASP is highly variable, depending on the cell type and the senescence-inducing stressor. This heterogeneity is the central challenge in the field. Recent large-scale data generation efforts have provided tantalizing glimpses into this complexity. Projects like the Tabula Muris Senis have generated single-cell transcriptomic data across the lifespan of mice, revealing age-associated shifts in cell populations that are likely related to senescence. Similarly, proteomic studies have begun to catalog the diversity of the SASP, while high-content imaging screens have documented the profound morphological changes that accompany the senescent transition. However, these valuable datasets remain largely siloed. Transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging, and epigenomic data are typically analyzed in isolation, preventing a holistic understanding of the senescent state. We lack a systematic framework to connect a cell's gene expression program to its morphology, its secretome, and its spatial interactions within a tissue. This fragmentation of knowledge represents a major gap in the field. It prevents the identification of robust, universal biomarkers of senescence and hampers the rational design of senotherapeutics—drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells. The lack of an integrated model means we cannot reliably distinguish between potentially beneficial and pathogenic senescent cells, a critical distinction for therapeutic intervention. This research is both important and timely. With global populations aging rapidly, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging is a paramount public health challenge. Senolytics are already advancing into clinical trials, yet our incomplete understanding of senescence heterogeneity poses a significant risk, as indiscriminate removal of all senescent cells could have unintended negative consequences. The recent explosion in publicly available multi-omics and imaging data, coupled with advances in machine learning and data integration algorithms, creates an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge. A community-scale synthesis effort, as proposed here, is now feasible and necessary to unify these disparate data streams into a coherent model. This project directly addresses the emergent nature of senescence by integrating data across biological scales, a task beyond the scope of any single lab and perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to solve fundamental questions in biosciences.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to construct a multi-scale, integrated 'Senescence Atlas' that systematically defines the core principles and context-dependent heterogeneity of cellular senescence. This atlas will serve as a predictive model of the senescent state, linking molecular programs to cellular morphology and tissue-level function. To achieve this, our working group will address four fundamental research questions.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can we establish a comprehensive molecular taxonomy of senescent cell subtypes by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data across diverse tissues, species, and senescence inducers?**
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Senescent cells can be classified into a finite set of distinct, transcriptionally-defined subtypes that represent core functional programs (e.g., 'pro-inflammatory,' 'pro-fibrotic,' 'immunosuppressive'), and these subtypes are conserved across different biological contexts.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** These transcriptional subtypes are governed by specific and recurring patterns of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, which serve as a stable epigenetic memory of the senescent state.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will apply unsupervised clustering algorithms to integrated single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets from public repositories. Subtypes will be defined by robust marker genes and regulatory elements. We will validate the taxonomy by training a machine learning classifier on a subset of the data and testing its ability to accurately classify cells in independent datasets. The expected deliverable is a hierarchical classification of senescence subtypes with detailed molecular signatures.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): Can deep learning models trained on high-resolution imaging data accurately identify senescent cells and do their morphological phenotypes correlate with defined molecular subtypes?**
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to distinguish senescent from non-senescent cells with high accuracy (>90%) based solely on morphological features (e.g., cell size, nuclear shape, organelle texture) extracted from microscopy images.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The quantitative morphological features learned by the CNN will correlate significantly with the molecular subtypes defined in RQ1, establishing a direct link between gene expression programs and the physical phenotype of the cell.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will curate and annotate a large image dataset of senescent and control cells from the Image Data Resource and other public sources. A CNN will be trained and rigorously validated using cross-validation. To test H2b, we will identify datasets with paired imaging and transcriptomic data, allowing us to directly correlate the model's morphological classifications with molecular profiles using statistical methods. The deliverable is a validated, open-source image analysis pipeline for senescence detection.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How does the composition of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) vary across molecular subtypes, and what are the core regulatory networks controlling its expression?**
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The SASP is not a single entity but comprises distinct modules of secreted factors, and the expression of these modules is tightly coupled to specific molecular subtypes of senescent cells.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** By integrating proteomic data of the secretome with transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we can identify key transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, C/EBPβ) and signaling pathways that act as master regulators for different SASP modules.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate public proteomic datasets of senescent secretomes with our molecular subtype definitions. We will use weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-secreted proteins and correlate them with subtypes. We will perform transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis on the regulatory regions of SASP genes to validate regulatory hypotheses. The outcome will be a comprehensive map linking SASP composition to cell subtype and its underlying regulatory network.

**Research Question 4 (RQ4): How are senescent cell subtypes spatially organized within tissues, and how do they interact with their microenvironment to drive emergent phenotypes like chronic inflammation?**
*   **Hypothesis 4a:** The spatial distribution of senescent cells in tissues is non-random, with specific subtypes preferentially localizing to distinct tissue niches or in proximity to particular cell types (e.g., immune cells).
*   **Hypothesis 4b:** The identity and spatial arrangement of senescent subtypes and their neighbors can predict the local tissue state (e.g., inflammation, fibrosis, immune surveillance), revealing the rules of their collective behavior.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will leverage public spatial transcriptomics datasets. Using our molecular signatures from RQ1, we will deconvolve the identity and location of senescent subtypes. We will then apply spatial statistics to test for non-random co-localization patterns and use ligand-receptor interaction modeling to map potential signaling networks in situ. The deliverable will be a set of 'interaction maps' detailing the social context of different senescent subtypes.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in computational biology, gerontology, computer vision, and spatial omics. The collaborative structure, facilitated by NCEMS, is essential for integrating the diverse data types and analytical approaches required. Our approach is organized around a 3-year timeline with clear milestones and deliverables, all adhering to open science principles.

**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** The project will be co-led by four PIs from different institutions, ensuring a diversity of perspectives. The team will include two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students who will work across labs, fostering a deeply collaborative and interdisciplinary training environment. Collaboration will be managed through weekly virtual meetings, quarterly in-person workshops hosted by NCEMS, a shared Slack channel for daily communication, and a centralized GitHub organization for all code and analysis pipelines. This structure demonstrates a clear need for NCEMS support to facilitate a level of interaction beyond a standard multi-PI grant.

**Data Acquisition and Curation (Milestone 1: Months 1-6):** Our first major task is to build a comprehensive, curated database of publicly available senescence-related data. We will systematically mine repositories including NCBI GEO, SRA, ENCODE, ProteomeXchange, Image Data Resource (IDR), and the Human Cell Atlas. A standardized metadata schema will be developed to capture critical experimental variables (species, tissue, cell type, senescence inducer, protocol). Datasets will include:
*   **Transcriptomics:** Over 100 single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets from aged or diseased tissues (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis) and numerous bulk RNA-seq datasets from in vitro senescence models.
*   **Epigenomics:** Publicly available scATAC-seq, CUT&RUN, and ChIP-seq data for key histone marks (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K9me3) and DNA methylation arrays from well-characterized senescent systems.
*   **Proteomics:** Mass spectrometry datasets of conditioned media from senescent cells cataloged in ProteomeXchange and other repositories.
*   **Imaging:** High-content microscopy screens from IDR and other sources, featuring morphological and marker-based staining of senescent cells.
*   **Spatial Omics:** Public Visium, MIBI-TOF, and MERFISH datasets from tissues known to accumulate senescent cells, such as fibrotic lung and aged skin.
*   **Deliverable:** A public, searchable catalog of all curated datasets with standardized metadata.

**Analytical Plan:**
*   **Aim 1: Molecular Subtype Definition (Milestone 2: Months 7-18):** We will develop and apply a standardized computational pipeline for processing all transcriptomic and epigenomic data. Data integration will be performed using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Harmony, Seurat v4) to correct for batch effects. We will then use graph-based clustering (e.g., Leiden) on the integrated latent space to identify putative senescent subtypes. These subtypes will be characterized by identifying differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns. The robustness of the subtypes will be validated across datasets and species.
*   **Aim 2: Morphological Phenotyping (Milestone 3: Months 7-24):** Images will be preprocessed using a pipeline built with CellProfiler and Python libraries. We will employ a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) on our annotated image dataset to classify cells. The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated. We will use explainable AI techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) to identify the key morphological features driving classification. These features will then be statistically correlated with the molecular subtypes from Aim 1 using datasets where both data types are available.
*   **Aim 3: SASP Characterization (Milestone 4: Months 12-30):** Proteomic data will be re-analyzed through a uniform pipeline to ensure comparability. We will map secreted proteins to their genes and test for the enrichment of specific protein sets within our transcriptomic subtypes. Regulatory network inference tools (e.g., SCENIC) will be applied to the integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic data to identify transcription factors that regulate subtype-specific SASP modules.
*   **Aim 4: Spatial Analysis (Milestone 5: Months 18-36):** We will use our molecular subtype signatures as a reference to deconvolve the spatial locations of senescent cells in spatial transcriptomics data using tools like cell2location. Following deconvolution, we will apply a suite of spatial statistics tools (e.g., from the `squidpy` library) to analyze neighborhood compositions, cell-cell interactions, and niche organization. Ligand-receptor modeling will predict signaling pathways active between senescent cells and their microenvironment.

**Timeline and Open Science:**
*   **Year 1:** Data curation, pipeline development, initial molecular subtype definition, and image model training.
*   **Year 2:** Refinement of subtypes, integration with proteomics and imaging, and initial spatial analysis.
*   **Year 3:** Final multi-modal integration, construction of the interactive Senescence Atlas web portal, manuscript preparation, and community workshops.
All code will be developed openly on GitHub with version control. All processed data, analysis results, and trained models will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Model Zoo) with detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility and community reuse.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of aging biology, cell biology, and translational medicine. Its impact will be felt through the creation of a foundational public resource, the generation of novel biological insights, the development of new analytical tools, and the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **The Senescence Atlas:** The primary deliverable will be a first-of-its-kind, multi-scale 'Senescence Atlas,' delivered as an open-access, interactive web portal. This will not be a static repository but a dynamic knowledge base allowing researchers to explore the connections between genes, proteins, cell morphologies, and tissue locations across dozens of contexts. It will become an indispensable resource for the aging research community, analogous to resources like the Human Cell Atlas or the ENCODE portal.
2.  **A Data-Driven Taxonomy of Senescence:** We will replace the current ambiguous and qualitative descriptions of senescence with a robust, quantitative classification of senescent subtypes. This new taxonomy, based on the integration of thousands of data points, will provide a common language for the field, resolve long-standing controversies, and allow for the re-interpretation of previous studies in a new, more precise context.
3.  **Robust, Multi-Modal Biomarkers:** By identifying the core molecular and morphological features that are conserved across different senescent subtypes and contexts, this project will deliver a panel of validated, high-confidence biomarkers. This will overcome a major bottleneck in the field, enabling more reliable detection and quantification of senescent cells in both research and clinical settings.
4.  **A Novel Integrative Analytical Framework:** We will develop and disseminate a powerful, open-source computational workflow for synthesizing multi-modal biological data (genomics, proteomics, imaging, spatial-omics). This framework will be a valuable resource in itself, adaptable by other researchers to study different complex biological phenomena characterized by heterogeneity and emergent properties.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Senotherapeutics:** Our findings will have a direct and immediate impact on the development of drugs targeting senescent cells. By defining subtype-specific vulnerabilities and SASP profiles, the atlas will enable the design of next-generation, precision senolytics that can target pathogenic senescent cells while sparing those with beneficial functions. This will lead to more effective and safer therapies for a host of age-related diseases.
*   **Enhancing Diagnostics:** The machine learning models for image-based senescence detection have the potential to be translated into digital pathology tools. This could provide clinicians with a quantitative, automated method to assess senescent cell burden in patient biopsies, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of treatment response.
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is intrinsically designed to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interface of biology, data science, and machine learning. Through the NCEMS working group model, trainees will gain invaluable experience in large-scale data analysis, collaborative team science, and open-source software development, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-driven biomedical workforce.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
Our commitment to open science will ensure maximum impact. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. The Senescence Atlas web portal will be our primary means of dissemination to the research community. We will actively promote its use through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., GSA, ASCB, ISMB) and by hosting hands-on workshops to train users. The atlas is envisioned as a living resource, designed with a flexible architecture to incorporate new public datasets as they become available. We will seek follow-on funding to ensure its long-term maintenance and expansion, establishing a permanent, community-driven resource that will catalyze research and discovery in aging biology for many years to come.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the scope of a single research laboratory or a traditional multi-PI grant. The project's success hinges on the deep integration of diverse expertise and the dedicated resources for data management, computational analysis, and collaborative coordination that the NCEMS working group model is uniquely positioned to provide. A conventional funding mechanism would not adequately support the intensive, cross-disciplinary personnel effort and the collaborative infrastructure required to synthesize petabytes of heterogeneous data into a unified, public-facing resource.

**Existing Resources:** The collaborating PIs will contribute significant existing resources, including faculty time, administrative support, and access to institutional high-performance computing clusters. The project leverages the immense prior investment made by funding agencies in generating the public data we will synthesize. This budget is therefore highly cost-effective, focusing specifically on the value-added activities of integration, analysis, tool development, and dissemination that are central to the NCEMS mission.",,
ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_09,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Decoding the Functional Grammar of the Non-Coding Transcriptome,"While thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed from the human genome, the functional roles of the vast majority remain enigmatic. This project proposes a large-scale computational synthesis to create a 'functional grammar' for lncRNAs, enabling the prediction of their biological roles. A multidisciplinary working group will integrate several key public datasets: 1) The comprehensive FANTOM and ENCODE compendia of lncRNA expression and chromatin states across cell types; 2) eCLIP and RIP-seq data identifying the proteins that bind to lncRNAs; 3) Chromatin interaction data (Hi-C, ChIA-PET) to link lncRNAs to their potential gene targets in 3D space; and 4) RNA secondary structure predictions and probing data. The team will develop a multi-layered network model where lncRNAs, proteins, and target genes are nodes connected by different types of functional evidence. By applying network propagation algorithms and machine learning, we will: a) Cluster lncRNAs into functional modules based on shared properties (e.g., binding proteins, subcellular localization, target pathways); b) Predict whether a lncRNA acts as a 'scaffold', 'guide', 'decoy', or 'enhancer'; and c) Generate high-confidence hypotheses for thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs. This will produce a foundational resource, the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' to guide experimental research into the non-coding genome.",,"Background And Significance

The central dogma of molecular biology has long focused on the flow of genetic information from DNA to protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to functional proteins. However, landmark genomics projects like ENCODE and FANTOM have revealed a surprising truth: the vast majority of the human genome is pervasively transcribed, yet less than 2% codes for proteins. This discovery has unveiled a massive, largely unexplored world of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)—transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with no apparent protein-coding potential—have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression and cellular function. Tens of thousands of lncRNAs have been annotated, but the biological roles of over 98% remain completely unknown, representing one of the most significant knowledge gaps in modern molecular biology. Seminal studies on a few well-characterized lncRNAs have provided tantalizing glimpses into their diverse mechanisms. For example, *XIST* orchestrates X-chromosome inactivation through epigenetic silencing, *HOTAIR* acts as a scaffold for chromatin-modifying complexes to regulate developmental genes, and *MALAT1* modulates alternative splicing in the nucleus. These examples have led to the formulation of functional archetypes for lncRNAs, which can act as 'signals' (indicators of transcriptional activity), 'decoys' (titrating away proteins or microRNAs), 'guides' (directing enzymes to specific genomic loci), or 'scaffolds' (assembling multi-component molecular complexes). Despite these foundational discoveries, our understanding is limited to a handful of exemplars. The sheer number of lncRNAs makes a one-by-one experimental approach intractable and economically infeasible. Consequently, there is an urgent need for systematic, scalable methods to predict lncRNA function. Previous computational efforts have laid important groundwork but suffer from key limitations. Many approaches rely on a single data type, such as 'guilt-by-association' based on co-expression with protein-coding genes. While useful, expression correlation is often noisy and does not distinguish between direct and indirect effects. Other methods use genomic proximity to infer targets, a principle that fails to account for the widespread long-range regulation mediated by lncRNAs in the three-dimensional nucleus. Databases like LncRNAdb and LncBook have cataloged functional information for known lncRNAs, but they do not provide predictive power for the uncharacterized majority. The critical gap in the field is the lack of a comprehensive framework that can integrate the multi-modal molecular features of lncRNAs—their expression, their protein-binding partners, their structural motifs, and their chromosomal context—to derive a holistic understanding of their function. This research is exceptionally timely due to the recent explosion of publicly available, relevant datasets. The ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated comprehensive maps of transcription, chromatin states, and RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactions (e.g., eCLIP-seq) across hundreds of cell types. Concurrently, projects like the 4D Nucleome (4DN) have mapped the 3D architecture of the genome (e.g., Hi-C), providing the missing link between lncRNAs and their distal gene targets. The time is ripe to synthesize these disparate, massive datasets to construct a 'functional grammar' for the non-coding transcriptome. This project proposes to fill this critical gap by creating a unified computational framework to systematically classify lncRNAs and predict their mechanisms of action, thereby providing a foundational resource to guide future experimental investigation and unlock the biological significance of the dark matter of the genome.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to systematically decode the functional roles of thousands of uncharacterized human lncRNAs by developing a novel computational framework that integrates multi-modal public data. We aim to move beyond simple cataloging to create a predictive 'functional grammar' that can classify lncRNAs into mechanistic archetypes and generate high-confidence, testable hypotheses about their biological functions. To achieve this, we will address four primary research questions (RQs).

RQ1: Can we systematically partition the human lncRNAome into functional modules by integrating their expression patterns, RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactomes, subcellular localization, and 3D chromatin contacts? This question addresses whether the combined molecular properties of lncRNAs can reveal higher-order organization corresponding to shared biological pathways or regulatory circuits.

H1: We hypothesize that lncRNAs with similar RBP binding profiles, co-expression patterns across diverse cell types, and spatial proximity to similar gene targets will form distinct functional modules. We predict that applying community detection algorithms to a multi-layered network representing these data types will reveal clusters of lncRNAs and proteins. These modules will be significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms or KEGG pathways, reflecting their collective role in a biological process. We will validate this by demonstrating that our integrated modules show stronger functional coherence than modules derived from any single data type alone and by confirming that well-characterized lncRNAs cluster with their known protein partners and target pathways.

RQ2: Can a predictive model be developed to accurately assign lncRNAs to specific mechanistic archetypes (e.g., scaffold, guide, decoy, enhancer-associated) based on their integrated molecular features? This question seeks to establish a systematic classification scheme for lncRNA function.

H2: We hypothesize that a machine learning classifier, trained on features derived from well-characterized lncRNAs, can accurately predict the functional archetype for uncharacterized lncRNAs. We predict that a model (e.g., XGBoost) will achieve high cross-validation accuracy (>80%). Key predictive features will include the number and diversity of RBP partners (indicative of a 'scaffold'), strong association with a single chromatin modifier and a specific genomic locus (a 'guide'), or transcription from an active enhancer region (an 'enhancer' lncRNA). Validation will involve testing the model on a held-out set of known lncRNAs and performing in silico validation by correlating our predictions with orthogonal data, such as disease associations from GWAS catalogs.

RQ3: How do the structural features of lncRNAs, such as secondary structure motifs, correlate with their functional classification and RBP binding partners? This question explores the role of RNA structure in dictating function.

H3: We hypothesize that specific, evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structure motifs are predictive of binding by distinct RBP families and are associated with specific functional archetypes. We predict that statistical analysis will reveal significant correlations between structural motifs (e.g., G-quadruplexes, complex stem-loops) and the binding sites of RBPs with known structural preferences. For example, lncRNAs predicted to be 'scaffolds' will be enriched for multiple, distinct structural domains capable of hosting diverse proteins. We will validate this by building a structure-based model of RBP binding and testing its predictive power on eCLIP datasets.

RQ4: Can we generate high-confidence, testable hypotheses about the specific gene targets and regulatory pathways for thousands of previously uncharacterized lncRNAs?

H4: We hypothesize that by using network propagation algorithms on our integrated multi-layered network, we can accurately predict the protein-coding gene targets of lncRNAs. We predict that this method, which leverages multiple evidence types simultaneously (co-expression, 3D proximity, shared RBP partners), will outperform predictions based on any single data type. The outcome will be a ranked list of target genes for each lncRNA. We will validate our predictions by showing that our predicted lncRNA-gene pairs are significantly more likely to be co-cited in literature and share functional annotations than random pairs.

Expected Deliverables: The project will produce several key deliverables: 1) A comprehensive, integrated multi-layered network of lncRNA interactions. 2) A systematic catalog of lncRNA functional modules. 3) A robust, validated machine learning model for predicting lncRNA functional archetypes. 4) The 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' a publicly accessible web portal containing all data and predictions. 5) A prioritized list of high-confidence functional hypotheses for at least 1,000 uncharacterized lncRNAs to guide experimental validation by the broader community.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed in four integrated phases, leveraging a transdisciplinary team with expertise in computational biology, RNA biology, and data science. Our approach is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and compliant with open science principles.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Processing, and Integration (Months 1-12)**
This foundational phase involves the collection and uniform processing of multiple large-scale public datasets. We will develop a reproducible data processing pipeline using Snakemake to ensure consistency and facilitate future updates.
*   **LncRNA Annotation and Expression:** We will use the GENCODE (v43+) comprehensive lncRNA catalog as our reference. LncRNA expression will be quantified from uniformly processed RNA-seq data from the GTEx (v8) and ENCODE (v5) projects, covering thousands of samples across diverse human tissues and cell lines. This will yield a rich expression matrix.
*   **RNA-Protein Interactions:** We will download and process all available human eCLIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE portal (>400 experiments for >150 RBPs). Raw reads will be mapped and peaks will be called using a standardized pipeline (e.g., CLIPper) to generate a comprehensive lncRNA-RBP binding matrix.
*   **3D Genome Architecture:** To link lncRNAs to their distal targets, we will utilize high-resolution Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and HiChIP data from the 4D Nucleome (4DN) portal and ENCODE. Significant chromatin loops connecting lncRNA promoters to gene promoters will be identified using established tools (e.g., Fit-Hi-C).
*   **Chromatin State and Accessibility:** We will leverage imputed 25-state ChromHMM models from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and ENCODE to annotate the genomic context of each lncRNA. This will allow us to identify lncRNAs transcribed from active enhancers (eRNAs), promoters, or repressed regions.
*   **RNA Structure:** We will compute secondary structure predictions for all lncRNAs using tools like RNAfold and IPknot. Where available, we will integrate experimental structure-probing data (e.g., SHAPE-MaP) to refine these models. Structural motifs will be identified using specialized search algorithms.
All processed data will be stored in a centralized, version-controlled database for efficient access.

**Phase 2: Multi-Layered Network Construction and Module Identification (Months 10-20)**
To synthesize these diverse data modalities, we will construct a heterogeneous, multi-layered network. Nodes in the network will represent lncRNAs, protein-coding genes, and RBPs. Edges will represent different types of functional relationships, forming distinct layers:
*   **Layer 1 (Co-expression):** Weighted edges between all RNA nodes based on their Pearson correlation across GTEx and ENCODE samples.
*   **Layer 2 (RBP Binding):** Edges connecting lncRNAs to the RBPs that bind them, based on eCLIP peaks.
*   **Layer 3 (Chromatin Interaction):** Edges connecting lncRNA loci to gene loci based on significant Hi-C loops.
*   **Layer 4 (Protein-Protein Interaction):** Edges connecting RBPs based on known interactions from the STRING database.
To identify functional modules (RQ1), we will apply community detection algorithms designed for multi-layered networks, such as Infomap or MultiNMF. These algorithms will identify dense subgraphs of lncRNAs, RBPs, and genes that are highly interconnected across multiple evidence layers. The resulting modules will be functionally characterized via enrichment analysis for GO terms, KEGG pathways, and disease associations.

**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling of LncRNA Functional Archetypes (Months 18-30)**
To address RQ2 and RQ3, we will develop a machine learning framework. First, we will curate a 'gold standard' training set of ~200 lncRNAs with well-documented functions from literature (e.g., from LncRNAdb, LncBook) and manually assign them to one of four archetypes: 'scaffold', 'guide', 'decoy', or 'enhancer'. For every lncRNA, we will engineer a comprehensive feature vector comprising:
*   *Network Features:* Node degree, betweenness centrality, module membership.
*   *Binding Features:* Number and diversity of bound RBPs, binding affinity of specific protein families (e.g., chromatin modifiers, splicing factors).
*   *Genomic Features:* Chromatin state at the promoter, evolutionary conservation score (phyloP).
*   *Expression Features:* Maximum expression level, tissue-specificity score (Tau).
*   *Structural Features:* Presence of conserved motifs, overall structural complexity.
We will train a multi-class XGBoost classifier on this feature set using 10-fold cross-validation. Feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP values) will be used to identify the key molecular properties that define each functional class. The trained model will then be applied to predict the functional archetype for all uncharacterized lncRNAs.

**Phase 4: Hypothesis Generation and Dissemination (Months 24-36)**
To generate high-confidence hypotheses about lncRNA targets (RQ4), we will employ network propagation algorithms (e.g., Random Walk with Restart) on the integrated network. For a given lncRNA, this method identifies genes that are 'close' in the network by considering all possible paths through multiple layers, effectively integrating all available evidence. This will produce a ranked list of putative targets for each lncRNA. The final output of our work will be the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' a user-friendly web portal where users can search for any lncRNA and visualize its predicted module, archetype, features, and targets. All code and processed data will be made available on GitHub and Zenodo.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology by providing a systematic framework for understanding the function of the non-coding genome. Our contributions will be multifaceted, spanning the creation of a foundational community resource, the development of a novel analytical paradigm, and the generation of thousands of testable biological hypotheses.

**Primary Outcome: The lncRNA Functional Atlas**
The principal deliverable will be the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' a comprehensive, publicly accessible web resource. This will be the first-of-its-kind platform to provide systematic, evidence-based functional predictions for the vast majority of human lncRNAs. Unlike existing databases that catalog known information, our Atlas will be predictive. It will enable any researcher, regardless of their computational expertise, to query a lncRNA of interest and receive a rich, multi-layered summary of its predicted functional module, mechanistic archetype (e.g., scaffold, guide), key protein interactors, and putative gene targets, complete with confidence scores and links to the underlying evidence. This will democratize access to complex genomic data synthesis and serve as an essential hypothesis-generation tool for the entire biomedical research community.

**Contribution to the Field: A New Paradigm for Data Synthesis**
Methodologically, this project will establish a powerful new paradigm for functional genomics. By demonstrating the utility of a multi-layered network approach to integrate disparate data types—transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and structural—we will create a blueprint for holistic analysis of gene regulation. This analytical framework will be highly generalizable and can be adapted to study other classes of non-coding elements (e.g., circular RNAs, enhancers) or applied to different species, thereby providing a durable contribution to computational biology.

**Broader Impact: Accelerating Biomedical Discovery and Understanding Disease**
Our work will have a profound impact on biomedical research. Currently, a biologist who discovers a novel lncRNA associated with a disease faces a daunting, resource-intensive path to determine its function. Our Atlas will dramatically accelerate this process. By providing high-confidence predictions, it will allow researchers to bypass years of exploratory work and immediately design targeted experiments to validate specific mechanisms. This will lower the barrier to entry for studying lncRNAs and catalyze new research directions. Furthermore, many lncRNAs are implicated in complex human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. By annotating the function of these disease-associated lncRNAs, our work will provide crucial insights into their roles in pathogenesis. For example, identifying a cancer-upregulated lncRNA as a 'guide' for an oncogenic chromatin modifier would immediately suggest a tangible mechanism and a potential therapeutic target.

**Training and Collaboration**
This project is intrinsically aligned with the NCEMS mission to train the next generation of data-savvy scientists. The working group structure will provide an exceptional cross-disciplinary training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in large-scale data management, network biology, machine learning, and open science practices—a skill set in high demand. We will further broaden our educational impact by hosting annual virtual workshops to train the wider community on using the Atlas and our analytical tools, fostering a collaborative ecosystem around non-coding RNA research.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision**
We are committed to open science principles. All findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. The web portal, all underlying processed data, and all analysis code will be made freely available via GitHub and public repositories like Zenodo, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Our long-term vision is for the lncRNA Functional Atlas to become a living resource. The pipeline we develop will be automated and scalable, allowing us to periodically incorporate new public datasets as they are released, continuously refining and expanding the predictions. This project will establish a durable collaborative network and a computational foundation for a sustained, community-wide effort to illuminate the dark matter of the genome.

Budget And Resources

This project's scope, which involves synthesizing petabytes of public data and requires deep, synergistic expertise from multiple scientific domains, makes it uniquely suited for and dependent on the support of an NCEMS Working Group.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_10,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,A Systems-Level Synthesis of Cellular Responses to Diverse Environmental Stressors,"Cells have evolved intricate networks to survive a wide range of environmental insults, from heat shock to nutrient deprivation. This project seeks to uncover the universal principles of the cellular stress response by synthesizing hundreds of publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. We hypothesize that beneath the stressor-specific responses lies a 'core' stress response network that integrates diverse signals and coordinates a general survival program. A working group of systems biologists, toxicologists, and data scientists will collate and rigorously normalize datasets from yeast, flies, worms, and human cells exposed to dozens of different stressors (e.g., oxidative, genotoxic, osmotic, metabolic). Using advanced analytical techniques, including dimensionality reduction, network inference, and comparative pathway analysis, we will: 1) Decompose the cellular response into conserved, core modules and stressor-specific peripheral modules; 2) Identify the key transcription factors and signaling hubs that orchestrate the core response; and 3) Build a predictive model that, given a new stressor, can forecast which response modules will be activated. This synthesis will provide a fundamental understanding of cellular resilience and the emergent property of stress adaptation, with broad implications for toxicology, disease biology, and aging research.",,"Background And Significance

The ability of a cell to sense, respond, and adapt to environmental stress is a fundamental property of life. From bacteria to humans, organisms are equipped with sophisticated molecular networks that mitigate damage and ensure survival in the face of insults such as temperature shifts, nutrient scarcity, oxidative damage, and exposure to toxins. For decades, molecular and cellular biology has successfully dissected individual stress response pathways in remarkable detail. Seminal research has elucidated the Heat Shock Response (HSR) governed by HSF1, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that monitors proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the DNA Damage Response (DDR) orchestrated by kinases like ATM and ATR, and the Oxidative Stress Response mediated by transcription factors like Nrf2/SKN-1. These studies have provided a deep, yet fragmented, understanding of cellular defense mechanisms. Typically, they focus on a single stressor, a single pathway, and often a single model organism. This reductionist approach, while powerful, has created a significant knowledge gap: we lack a holistic, systems-level understanding of how these distinct pathways are integrated to produce a coherent, robust cellular response. Early genomic studies, such as the landmark work by Gasch et al. (2000) in yeast, revealed a common 'Environmental Stress Response' (ESR), a shared transcriptional program activated by diverse stressors. This provided the first glimpse that beneath stressor-specific adaptations lies a more universal, core program. However, these early studies were limited by the available data and analytical tools. They could not fully decompose the response into its constituent parts, identify the master regulators coordinating the network across different stress types, or generalize these findings across diverse eukaryotic species. Today, we are at a critical juncture. Public data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and the Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE) have become vast digital libraries, housing hundreds of thousands of datasets from experiments probing cellular responses to a myriad of perturbations. Concurrently, advances in computational biology, data science, and machine learning have equipped us with powerful tools for data integration, network inference, and predictive modeling. The time is therefore ripe for a community-scale synthesis effort to integrate this wealth of existing data and address fundamental questions about the emergent property of cellular resilience. This research is critically important because a fragmented understanding of stress responses limits our ability to tackle complex biological problems. Chronic, unresolved cellular stress is a unifying feature of aging and a wide range of human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases (proteotoxic stress), cancer (genotoxic and metabolic stress), and cardiovascular disease (oxidative stress). A systems-level map of the stress response network would provide a powerful framework for understanding the common molecular underpinnings of these disparate diseases. Furthermore, in toxicology and environmental science, we need better methods to predict the cellular impact of the thousands of novel chemicals introduced into our environment. By uncovering the universal principles of stress adaptation, this project will not only solve a long-standing puzzle in fundamental cell biology but also provide actionable insights with broad translational and societal impact. This proposal directly aligns with the research call's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to synthesize public data, answer novel questions about emergence phenomena, and train the next generation of data-savvy biologists.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research project is designed to transition the study of cellular stress from a collection of individual pathways to an integrated, systems-level science. Our central goal is to define the universal organizational principles of the eukaryotic stress response by synthesizing a massive corpus of public transcriptomic and proteomic data. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research questions, each with a corresponding testable hypothesis. 

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can the global cellular response to diverse environmental stressors be computationally decomposed into a conserved, 'core' functional program and a set of stressor-specific 'peripheral' modules?**
We hypothesize that a substantial and identifiable component of the molecular response is common across a wide array of stressors, constituting a 'Core Stress Response' (CSR). This CSR represents a general survival strategy. We predict this core module will be highly conserved across yeast, flies, worms, and human cells and will be functionally enriched for fundamental processes such as protein quality control (chaperones, proteasome), metabolic reprogramming towards conservation and repair, broad-spectrum detoxification, and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, we hypothesize that 'peripheral' modules will be activated by smaller, specific subsets of stressors and will be enriched for functions that directly counteract a particular insult, such as specific DNA repair enzymes for genotoxins or osmolyte transporters for osmotic shock. To test this, we will apply matrix factorization methods to our integrated multi-species expression dataset. The successful identification of a large, functionally coherent module activated across the majority of stress conditions, alongside smaller, functionally specific modules activated by distinct stressor classes, would validate our hypothesis. The primary deliverable for this aim will be a comprehensive catalog of core and peripheral stress response modules, functionally annotated and conserved across species.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the key regulatory hubs, such as transcription factors and signaling kinases, that orchestrate the Core Stress Response and integrate signals from diverse stress-sensing pathways?**
We hypothesize that the CSR is not a simple aggregation of independent pathways but is coordinated by a limited set of master regulatory hubs that function as signal integrators. We predict that these hubs will include well-established stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) like HSF1, ATF4, and p53, as well as key signaling nodes like the MAPK and TOR pathways. Our hypothesis states that these factors will be identified by network inference algorithms as having high centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness) and connectivity specifically to the genes within the CSR module. To test this, we will construct a global regulatory network from our expression data. We will then validate our computationally predicted hubs by cross-referencing with orthogonal public data, such as ChIP-seq databases (e.g., ENCODE) and kinase-substrate databases. We expect to find significant enrichment of the binding motifs for our predicted hub TFs in the promoter regions of CSR genes, providing strong evidence for their direct regulatory role. The expected outcome is a high-confidence map of the core regulatory circuit governing cellular resilience.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can a predictive model be built to accurately forecast the cellular response profile—specifically, the pattern of core and peripheral module activation—to a novel, uncharacterized stressor?**
We hypothesize that the cellular response signature is a predictable, emergent property determined by the type of damage a stressor inflicts. Therefore, a machine learning model can learn the relationship between a stressor's physicochemical properties or known mode of action and the resulting transcriptional and proteomic fingerprint. We predict that a model trained on our large, diverse dataset can forecast which specific combination of our previously defined modules will be activated by a new chemical or environmental insult. To test this, we will train a multi-label classification model (e.g., a random forest or neural network) using stressor features as input and the module activation state as output. We will rigorously evaluate the model's predictive power using a leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation strategy. Success will be defined by the model's ability to achieve high accuracy (e.g., AUC > 0.8) in predicting the activation profile for held-out stressors. The deliverable will be a validated, open-source computational tool for in silico toxicogenomics and stress response prediction.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary Working Group comprising a systems biologist (PI 1), a cell biologist/toxicologist (PI 2), and a data scientist (PI 3), along with their trainees. This structure ensures that deep expertise in computational analysis, biological interpretation, and statistical rigor are integrated at every stage. The project is organized into a logical progression of five phases with clear milestones.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Curation (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase focuses on assembling the comprehensive dataset required for synthesis. We will perform systematic, keyword-based searches of public repositories, primarily NCBI GEO, EBI ArrayExpress (transcriptomics), and PRIDE/MassIVE (proteomics). Our search will target datasets from four key eukaryotic models: *S. cerevisiae*, *D. melanogaster*, *C. elegans*, and human cell lines (*H. sapiens*). Inclusion criteria are stringent: studies must contain appropriate unstressed controls, provide accessible raw or processed data, and have sufficient metadata to characterize the perturbation. We aim to collate over 500 individual datasets, encompassing more than 50 distinct stressors (e.g., heat shock, sodium arsenite, tunicamycin, doxorubicin, UV radiation, glucose starvation). A team of trainees, supervised by the PIs, will manually curate all relevant metadata into a standardized, machine-readable format. This curated metadata catalog will be a key project deliverable.

**Phase 2: Unified Data Processing and Normalization (Months 4-9)**
To enable meaningful integration, data from disparate sources must be processed through a single, uniform pipeline to minimize technical artifacts and batch effects. For all RNA-seq datasets, we will download the raw FASTQ files and process them using a standardized workflow (e.g., STAR for alignment, featureCounts for quantification). For microarray data, raw files will be processed using platform-specific standardized methods (e.g., RMA). Proteomics data will be re-analyzed from raw spectra using a consistent search engine (e.g., MaxQuant). Following initial processing, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq) to the combined expression matrices. The success of our normalization will be rigorously assessed using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), ensuring that biological variance (stressor type, cell type) dominates over technical variance (study of origin). Finally, to facilitate cross-species comparisons, all gene and protein identifiers will be mapped to ortholog groups using the OrthoDB database.

**Phase 3: Decomposing the Stress Response (Aim 1; Months 10-18)**
With the normalized, integrated data matrix, we will address RQ1. We will employ Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an unsupervised machine learning technique well-suited for identifying component parts in complex biological data. NMF will decompose the expression matrix into a set of co-regulated gene modules and their corresponding activation patterns across all experimental conditions. We will determine the optimal number of modules using consensus clustering and model stability metrics. Each resulting module will be subjected to extensive functional annotation using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) against GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway databases. A module will be classified as 'core' if its activation pattern is significant across a high percentage (>75%) of diverse stress conditions; otherwise, it will be classified as 'peripheral'.

**Phase 4: Inferring the Core Regulatory Network (Aim 2; Months 15-24)**
To identify the regulators of the Core Stress Response (CSR), we will apply network inference algorithms. We will use methods like ARACNE or GENIE3, which can infer regulatory relationships (e.g., transcription factor to target gene) from large-scale expression data. We will build a global regulatory network and identify hub proteins by calculating network centrality measures. To validate these computationally-derived hubs, we will perform two orthogonal analyses. First, we will test for the statistical enrichment of known transcription factor binding motifs (from databases like JASPAR) in the promoter regions of genes within the CSR module. Second, we will cross-reference our inferred regulatory links with experimentally-verified interactions from public ChIP-seq and protein-protein interaction databases.

**Phase 5: Developing a Predictive Model (Aim 3; Months 20-30)**
To address RQ3, we will build a predictive model. For chemical stressors, we will generate a feature vector describing their physicochemical properties using tools like RDKit (e.g., Morgan fingerprints, molecular weight). We will then train a multi-label random forest classifier. The input to the model will be the stressor's feature vector, and the output will be a binary vector indicating the activation state ('on' or 'off') of each of our previously identified stress modules. The model's performance will be assessed using a rigorous leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation scheme, measuring metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall. A high-performing model will demonstrate that the cellular response is a predictable emergent property of the stressor's characteristics.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on biomedical research and environmental science. Our contributions will be both conceptual and practical, providing new knowledge, powerful resources, and a new generation of trained scientists.

**Intellectual and Scientific Contributions:**
The primary outcome will be a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular stress. By moving beyond the study of isolated pathways, we will deliver the first **Unified Map of the Eukaryotic Stress Response Network**. This map will detail the components of a conserved **Core Stress Response (CSR)** and a diverse array of stressor-specific peripheral modules. This provides a concrete, data-driven definition of cellular resilience, an emergent property that has been conceptually important but difficult to define mechanistically. Our identification of the **master regulatory hubs** that orchestrate the CSR will pinpoint the critical integration nodes in the cell's decision-making circuitry, revealing how diverse threat signals are channeled into a coherent survival program. These findings will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, fundamentally altering textbook models of cell biology.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The knowledge and tools generated will have significant translational potential. In **disease biology**, our framework will illuminate the common molecular underpinnings of aging and chronic diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration, which share a foundation of unresolved cellular stress. The regulatory hubs of the CSR represent novel therapeutic targets for developing 'resilience-enhancing' drugs that could broadly protect against age-related cellular decline. In **toxicology and drug development**, our predictive model (Aim 3) will constitute a powerful new **in silico screening tool**. It will enable the rapid prediction of a novel chemical's cellular impact and mode of action from its structure alone, reducing costs, accelerating safety testing, and aligning with the '3Rs' goal of reducing animal testing.

**Open Science and Community Resources:**
In alignment with the research call's principles, all outcomes will be made openly available to the scientific community. We will develop a **publicly accessible web portal** that will serve as a central resource. This portal will provide interactive access to our integrated, normalized dataset, the defined gene/protein modules, the inferred regulatory networks, and our predictive model. This will empower researchers worldwide to explore our data, test their own hypotheses, and accelerate their research. All analytical code, pipelines, and workflows will be meticulously documented and shared on a public GitHub repository with a permissive open-source license, ensuring full reproducibility and reusability.

**Training and Workforce Development:**
This project is intrinsically designed as a training platform. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the Working Group, receiving immersive, hands-on training at the intersection of cell biology, data science, and systems biology. They will gain invaluable skills in managing large-scale data, developing robust computational pipelines, and working within a collaborative, multidisciplinary team—precisely the skills needed for the future biomedical workforce. We will foster their development through regular joint lab meetings, an annual in-person 'data-thon' workshop, and co-mentorship from all PIs. This project will thus directly contribute to training the next generation of leaders in data-intensive biological research.

**Long-Term Vision:**
This project will lay the foundation for a long-term, sustainable research program. The created data resource and analytical framework will be extensible, allowing for the future incorporation of new data types (e.g., metabolomics, epigenomics) and new organisms. The collaborative network established through this Working Group will foster follow-up projects, such as experimentally validating novel hub regulators or applying our predictive model in partnership with environmental agencies or pharmaceutical companies.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_01,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Synthesizing the Multi-Omic Landscape of Cellular Quiescence to Define a Universal Dormancy Program,"Cellular quiescence, a state of reversible cell cycle arrest, is fundamental to tissue homeostasis, stem cell maintenance, and cancer dormancy. Despite its importance, a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of the molecular principles governing entry into, maintenance of, and exit from quiescence is lacking. This project proposes to establish a multidisciplinary working group to synthesize the vast and growing body of publicly available multi-omics data related to quiescence. We will integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic datasets from diverse biological contexts, including yeast, cultured mammalian cells, primary stem cells, and dormant tumor cells. The central hypothesis is that a conserved 'core quiescence program' exists across species and cell types, which is then tailored by context-specific regulatory modules. The working group, comprising experts in cell cycle biology, systems biology, computational modeling, and machine learning, will develop a novel analytical pipeline to normalize and integrate these heterogeneous datasets. Our primary goals are to: 1) Identify a robust, cross-species molecular signature of the core quiescence program; 2) Map the signaling pathways and metabolic shifts that are universally associated with the quiescent state; and 3) Build predictive models that can distinguish between different 'depths' of quiescence and predict a cell's potential to re-enter the cell cycle. This project will produce a comprehensive 'Quiescence Atlas,' a valuable community resource that will illuminate a fundamental emergent state of cellular life and provide novel insights into aging and disease.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular quiescence, or G0, is a state of reversible cell cycle arrest that represents a fundamental alternative to proliferation. Unlike terminal differentiation or senescence, which are typically irreversible endpoints, quiescence is a dynamic and actively maintained state that is critical for the survival and function of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Its biological significance is vast, underpinning the long-term maintenance of adult stem cell pools (e.g., hematopoietic, neural, and muscle stem cells), enabling tissue repair, facilitating immune memory through long-lived lymphocytes, and contributing to organismal longevity. Conversely, the dysregulation of quiescence is a hallmark of numerous pathologies. The failure of stem cells to properly enter or exit quiescence contributes to age-related decline in regenerative capacity, while the ability of disseminated tumor cells to enter a dormant, quiescent state allows them to evade therapy and seed metastatic relapse years or decades after initial treatment. Despite its central importance, our understanding of quiescence remains remarkably fragmented. The field has historically studied this phenomenon in disparate model systems, from nutrient-starved yeast to contact-inhibited fibroblasts and in vivo stem cell populations. This has led to the identification of key context-specific regulators. For instance, work in mammalian cells has highlighted the crucial role of CDK inhibitors like p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 in establishing the G0 arrest. The suppression of growth-promoting signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, and the activation of stress-responsive pathways involving FOXO transcription factors are recognized as common themes. Metabolically, quiescent cells are known to downregulate anabolic processes and shift towards catabolic pathways like autophagy and fatty acid oxidation to maintain cellular integrity with minimal energy expenditure. Recent advances, particularly in single-cell transcriptomics, have revealed further complexity, demonstrating that quiescence is not a monolithic state but rather a spectrum of 'depths,' from a shallow, 'G0-alert' state poised for rapid cell cycle re-entry to a deep, more refractory state of dormancy. However, a major gap in our knowledge persists: the lack of a unified, systems-level model of the quiescent state. Current research exists in silos, with findings from yeast, cultured cells, and primary tissues rarely integrated. Consequently, we lack a definitive, universal molecular signature that defines a cell as 'quiescent' across all biological contexts. It remains unclear which molecular features constitute a 'core' quiescence program conserved through evolution, and which represent context-specific adaptations. The explosion of publicly available multi-omics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to address this gap. Thousands of transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic datasets from diverse quiescence models are available in public repositories like GEO, SRA, and PRIDE. Yet, these rich resources have not been systematically synthesized. This project is therefore both important and timely. It is important because a unified understanding of quiescence will provide a foundational framework for rationally manipulating this state in regenerative medicine, oncology, and aging research. It is timely because the confluence of massive public data availability and sophisticated computational methods for data integration and machine learning now makes it possible to tackle this grand challenge. By forming a multidisciplinary working group to synthesize this data, we can move beyond single-gene, single-pathway studies to define the emergent, systems-level principles that govern this fundamental state of cellular life.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research is founded on the central hypothesis that a conserved, core molecular program governs the entry into, maintenance of, and exit from the quiescent state across diverse eukaryotic species and cell types. We further hypothesize that this core program is modulated by context-specific regulatory layers that fine-tune the depth and reversibility of dormancy, explaining the functional heterogeneity observed in different biological systems. To systematically test this overarching hypothesis, we have structured our investigation into three specific aims, each with distinct research questions, testable hypotheses, and clear, predictable outcomes. 

**Aim 1: Identify a robust, cross-species molecular signature of the core quiescence program.**
This aim addresses the most fundamental gap in the field: the absence of a universal definition of quiescence. 
*   **Research Question 1.1:** What is the minimal, conserved set of genes, proteins, and epigenetic marks whose state consistently distinguishes quiescent cells from their proliferative counterparts across different species (e.g., yeast, mouse, human) and cell types (e.g., fibroblasts, stem cells, cancer cells)?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a conserved multi-omic signature exists, characterized by the coordinated upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors and stress-response factors, the downregulation of genes involved in DNA replication and biomass production, and specific, recurring patterns of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the regulatory regions of these core genes.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that a cross-dataset meta-analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data will reveal a statistically significant, common set of differentially expressed genes and proteins. We will validate the robustness of this signature by using it as a feature set to train a classifier that can accurately distinguish quiescent from proliferative cells in independent, held-out datasets not used in the discovery phase. The evolutionary conservation of the signature will be confirmed by analyzing orthologous genes across species.

**Aim 2: Map the universal signaling pathways and metabolic networks associated with quiescence.**
Beyond a simple list of molecules, we seek to understand the regulatory logic of the quiescent state.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Which signaling pathways, transcriptional regulatory networks, and metabolic programs are universally rewired during the transition to and maintenance of quiescence?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that the suppression of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and the activation of the AMPK pathway serve as central, conserved regulatory hubs that integrate diverse entry signals. We further hypothesize that this signaling shift orchestrates a universal metabolic reprogramming, characterized by a decrease in glycolysis and anaplerosis and an increase in catabolic processes like autophagy and fatty acid oxidation.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that pathway enrichment and network inference analyses performed on our integrated multi-omic data will consistently identify the mTOR, AMPK, and Hippo pathways as the most significantly perturbed. Our integrated model will predict specific regulatory connections (e.g., a transcription factor regulating a set of metabolic enzymes) that are conserved across datasets. We will validate these predictions by cross-referencing them with existing experimental data from perturbation studies (e.g., gene knockouts, drug treatments) available in the literature and public databases.

**Aim 3: Build predictive models to distinguish quiescence depths and predict reactivation potential.**
This aim seeks to capture the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of dormancy.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can we leverage the integrated multi-omic data to develop a quantitative 'quiescence score' that reflects the depth of dormancy (e.g., distinguishing a G0-alert state from deep quiescence)?
*   **Research Question 3.2:** Can molecular features from our integrated dataset predict the likelihood and kinetics of a cell's re-entry into the cell cycle upon stimulation?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that quiescence depth is a continuous variable reflected by quantitative changes in the expression of the core signature genes, the degree of chromatin condensation at proliferative loci, and the extent of metabolic suppression. 
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that a machine learning model trained on datasets with known quiescence depths (e.g., time-course experiments) will be able to accurately predict the dormancy state of cells from new datasets. The model's utility will be validated by testing its ability to predict experimentally measured reactivation potential in independent datasets, such as those from stem cell activation assays or cancer dormancy models. The ultimate deliverable will be a computational tool that can take new multi-omic data as input and output a predictive score of dormancy depth and reactivation capacity.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group, leveraging the unique expertise of its members in cell cycle biology, systems biology, and computational machine learning. Our approach is organized into four sequential but interconnected phases, designed to systematically collect, integrate, and analyze public data to address our central hypotheses. The collaborative framework is essential, as the scale and complexity of this synthesis project are beyond the capabilities of any single research lab, requiring the NCEMS working group model for success.

**Phase 1: Data Curation, Harmonization, and Pipeline Development (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase focuses on building a robust and reproducible computational infrastructure.
*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, Sequence Read Archive (SRA), PRIDE, and MetaboLights. We will use keyword searches (e.g., 'quiescence', 'G0', 'dormancy', 'serum starvation', 'contact inhibition') and screen thousands of studies based on pre-defined inclusion criteria: 1) must contain a direct comparison between a quiescent and a proliferative control group; 2) must be from a specified set of data types (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, proteomics, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, metabolomics); 3) must have sufficient metadata to describe the biological context (species, cell type, quiescence induction method). 
*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** A key innovation of this project will be the development of a unified data processing and normalization pipeline, implemented using a workflow manager like Snakemake or Nextflow to ensure reproducibility. For each data type, raw data will be processed using community-standard best practices (e.g., STAR alignment and RSEM quantification for RNA-seq; MaxQuant for proteomics). A critical step will be the application of advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq) to mitigate non-biological variation arising from different labs, platforms, and protocols. This will create a harmonized data matrix, the core substrate for all subsequent analyses.
*   **Data Integration Framework:** We will employ a multi-layered integration strategy. Initially, meta-analysis will be performed within each omics layer to identify robust signals. Subsequently, we will use multi-omic factor analysis tools, such as MOFA+ (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2), to uncover shared axes of variation across different data types. This will allow us to identify coordinated changes in transcripts, proteins, and chromatin states that define the quiescent state.

**Phase 2: Identification and Analysis of the Core Quiescence Program (Months 10-18)**
With the integrated data in hand, we will address Aims 1 and 2.
*   **Core Signature Discovery (Aim 1):** We will apply robust statistical meta-analysis methods (e.g., random-effects models, rank aggregation) to the harmonized data to identify a consensus list of differentially expressed genes/proteins. For epigenomic data, we will identify consensus differential peaks of accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone modification (ChIP-seq). We will then integrate these lists to define a high-confidence, multi-omic core signature of quiescence.
*   **Network and Pathway Mapping (Aim 2):** The core signature will be used as input for pathway enrichment analysis (e.g., GSEA) and network biology tools (e.g., STRING, Cytoscape). We will construct a consensus quiescence regulatory network by integrating protein-protein interaction data, kinase-substrate predictions, and transcription factor-target information. This network model will visualize the key hubs and modules that govern the quiescent state.

**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling of Quiescence Depth (Months 19-30)**
This phase will focus on Aim 3, translating our integrated data into predictive tools.
*   **Feature Engineering and Model Training:** We will leverage datasets that include time-series or multiple, distinct quiescent states to define features associated with dormancy 'depth'. These features will include expression levels of core signature genes, pathway activity scores derived from the network model, and chromatin accessibility metrics. We will use these features to train a suite of supervised machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines) to predict a cell's position on the quiescence spectrum.
*   **Model Validation and Interpretation:** Models will be rigorously validated using k-fold cross-validation and, most importantly, on completely independent test datasets not used for training. We will use model interpretation techniques (e.g., SHAP values) to identify the molecular features that are most predictive of quiescence depth and reactivation potential.

**Phase 4: Dissemination via the Quiescence Atlas (Months 31-36)**
*   **Atlas Development and Open Science:** The project will culminate in the creation of the 'Quiescence Atlas,' a publicly accessible web portal. This resource will allow users to explore the integrated data, visualize the core signature and network models, and use our predictive tools on their own data. All analysis code, workflows, and processed data will be made available through GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles and the open science mission of NCEMS.

**Timeline & Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of the data harmonization pipeline; initial meta-analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data; first working group publication on the methodology.
*   **Year 2:** Definition of the core multi-omic signature and consensus network model; development and internal validation of predictive models; presentations at international conferences.
*   **Year 3:** External validation of predictive models; launch of the public beta version of the Quiescence Atlas; submission of primary research manuscripts to high-impact journals.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This community-scale synthesis project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will reshape our understanding of cellular quiescence and provide invaluable resources for the broader biomedical research community. The impact will span from fundamental biological insights to tangible applications in medicine and biotechnology, directly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS program.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary outcome of this research will be a unified, systems-level framework for understanding cellular quiescence. This represents a paradigm shift from the current, fragmented view of dormancy. 
1.  **The First Universal Definition of Quiescence:** By identifying a robust, cross-species, multi-omic 'core quiescence program,' we will provide the field with a much-needed foundational definition. This signature will serve as a benchmark for future studies and resolve long-standing questions about the conservation of quiescence mechanisms from yeast to humans.
2.  **A Comprehensive Regulatory Map:** Our consensus network model will illuminate the universal signaling pathways and transcriptional circuits that govern the quiescent state. This will move beyond a 'parts list' of genes to a mechanistic understanding of how cells integrate signals to make the decision to enter or exit the cell cycle.
3.  **A Quantitative Framework for Dormancy:** The development of a predictive 'quiescence score' will be a major conceptual advance, reframing quiescence from a binary state to a quantifiable continuum. This will enable researchers to precisely characterize the depth of dormancy in their experimental systems, a critical parameter for studying stem cell function and cancer relapse.

**The Quiescence Atlas: A Lasting Community Resource:**
A major tangible outcome will be the 'Quiescence Atlas,' a publicly accessible web portal. This resource will democratize access to complex, integrated quiescence data. Analogous to landmark resources like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Quiescence Atlas will empower individual labs without extensive computational expertise to explore the molecular landscape of quiescence, query their genes of interest, and generate novel, data-driven hypotheses. This directly addresses the NCEMS goal of developing innovative research strategies and resources for the community.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The fundamental knowledge generated will have significant translational potential.
*   **Oncology:** Dormant, quiescent cancer cells are a major cause of therapeutic resistance and metastatic relapse. Our core signature could yield biomarkers to detect these elusive cells, and our network model could reveal novel therapeutic targets to either eradicate them or lock them in a permanently dormant state.
*   **Regenerative Medicine:** The ability to control the quiescence-to-proliferation transition is the holy grail of stem cell therapy. Our predictive models could help optimize protocols for activating stem cells for tissue repair or, conversely, for maintaining their long-term potency in culture.
*   **Aging Research:** The age-related decline in tissue function is linked to the exhaustion of stem cell pools and the accumulation of senescent cells. By providing a deep understanding of quiescence, our work will inform strategies to preserve regenerative capacity and promote healthy aging.

**Training and Collaboration:**
This project is an ideal vehicle for training the next generation of data-savvy biologists. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in big data synthesis, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and open science practices. The working group structure will foster a collaborative network that will persist beyond the funding period, seeding future projects and partnerships. We will develop and disseminate training materials and workshops based on our analysis pipelines, amplifying our impact on workforce development. 

**Dissemination Strategy:**
Our findings will be disseminated broadly through high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at major international conferences, and, most importantly, through the continuous development and promotion of the Quiescence Atlas. All code and data will be shared openly, ensuring our work is transparent, reproducible, and a building block for future research. This project will not only answer a fundamental question in cell biology but will also catalyze a new, community-oriented way of studying this critical cellular state.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research is a large-scale data synthesis project that requires a dedicated, multidisciplinary team and significant computational resources, making it an ideal fit for the NCEMS working group program.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:** The scale of this project—synthesizing thousands of datasets across multiple omics types—and the diverse expertise required—from cell cycle biology to machine learning—make it impossible for a single lab to undertake. The NCEMS working group model is uniquely suited to provide the collaborative structure, dedicated personnel, and computational resources necessary to build a community-wide resource like the Quiescence Atlas and answer this fundamental question in molecular and cellular biology.",,
ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_02,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,A Multi-Modal Inference Engine for Elucidating the Function of Uncharacterized Human Proteins,"A significant fraction of the human proteome remains functionally unannotated, representing a major gap in our understanding of cellular biology. This project aims to systematically 'de-orphanize' these Proteins of Unknown Function (PUFs) by creating a powerful, integrative inference engine. This community-scale effort will synthesize diverse, publicly available data types at an unprecedented scale. The working group will integrate: 1) 3D structural predictions from the AlphaFold Database to identify distant homologies and functional domains; 2) Large-scale protein-protein interaction maps (e.g., BioGRID, STRING) to place PUFs within functional networks; 3) Co-expression data across thousands of tissues and cell types from GTEx and single-cell atlases to infer function via 'guilt-by-association'; 4) Phylogenetic profiles to identify patterns of conservation and co-evolution with known proteins; and 5) Phenotypic data from genome-wide screens (e.g., DepMap). This project requires a transdisciplinary team of structural biologists, bioinformaticians, network scientists, and machine learning experts. The team will develop a sophisticated Bayesian framework that weighs evidence from each data modality to assign a probabilistic functional annotation to each PUF. The final output will be a publicly accessible, dynamic web portal that provides high-confidence functional hypotheses for hundreds of PUFs, empowering the broader research community to accelerate experimental validation and uncover novel biological pathways.",,"Background And Significance

The completion of the Human Genome Project ushered in a new era of biology, yet a fundamental challenge remains: assigning a function to every protein it encodes. Despite decades of research, a significant portion of the human proteome, estimated to be between 20-30% depending on annotation standards, consists of Proteins of Unknown Function (PUFs), often referred to as the 'dark proteome'. This knowledge gap represents a major barrier to a complete understanding of human health and disease. These uncharacterized proteins are not merely esoteric entities; many are evolutionarily conserved and have been linked through genetic studies to various diseases, yet their molecular roles remain enigmatic. Closing this gap is therefore a critical and timely endeavor for the molecular and cellular sciences.

Current computational approaches to protein function prediction have laid important groundwork but suffer from significant limitations. Historically, function annotation has relied heavily on sequence homology, using tools like BLAST to transfer annotations from well-characterized proteins to their relatives. While effective for proteins with close homologs, this approach fails for evolutionarily divergent proteins or those belonging to novel families. The advent of high-throughput experimental techniques has generated a wealth of diverse data types, each offering a different perspective on protein function. Network-based methods leverage large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps from resources like BioGRID and STRING, operating on the 'guilt-by-association' principle: proteins that interact physically are likely to be involved in the same biological process. Similarly, transcriptomic data from projects like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the Human Cell Atlas allow for the construction of co-expression networks, where genes with correlated expression patterns are inferred to be functionally linked. Genomic context methods, such as phylogenetic profiling, identify proteins that co-evolve across species, suggesting a functional constraint that maintains their co-occurrence. More recently, large-scale functional genomics screens, such as the DepMap project, provide phenotypic profiles based on gene essentiality across hundreds of cancer cell lines, enabling the clustering of genes with similar functional consequences.

A revolutionary advance has been the development of highly accurate protein structure prediction by AlphaFold, which has provided high-quality structural models for nearly the entire human proteome. Structure is a stronger correlate of function than sequence, and comparing 3D structures can reveal distant evolutionary relationships and functional sites (e.g., active sites, binding pockets) that are invisible at the sequence level. Tools like FoldSeek are now making proteome-scale structural comparisons feasible.

The key limitation of the current landscape is the siloed nature of these data and the methods used to analyze them. Most existing prediction tools are uni-modal, relying on a single data type. This not only limits their predictive power but can also introduce systematic biases inherent to the source data. While some integrative methods exist, they often combine only two or three data types, lack a rigorous statistical foundation for weighing evidence, or have not been applied systematically to the entire 'dark proteome'. The sheer scale and heterogeneity of publicly available data present a formidable integration challenge that is beyond the scope of a typical research lab.

This project is critically important and timely because we have reached a unique inflection point. For the first time, we possess both the comprehensive, multi-modal public datasets and the computational and methodological sophistication required to tackle the PUF problem at a community scale. The availability of the AlphaFold database, in particular, provides a structural scaffold that can anchor and contextualize evidence from all other modalities. By creating a transdisciplinary working group of bioinformaticians, structural biologists, network scientists, and machine learning experts, we can develop a principled Bayesian framework to synthesize these disparate data streams. Such an effort will not only generate a wealth of novel, testable hypotheses about fundamental cellular processes but will also create an invaluable public resource to accelerate biomedical research worldwide.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to systematically elucidate the functions of uncharacterized human proteins (PUFs) by developing and applying a novel, multi-modal inference engine. This endeavor is guided by a set of core research questions and testable hypotheses designed to rigorously assess the power of data synthesis and generate high-confidence biological discoveries.

**Primary Research Questions:**

**RQ1: Can the probabilistic integration of diverse, orthogonal data modalities generate functional annotations for PUFs that are significantly more accurate, comprehensive, and confident than predictions from any single data type?** This question addresses the central premise of data synthesis. We will investigate whether combining evidence from protein structure, physical interactions, gene co-expression, phylogenetic conservation, and functional genomics screens provides a synergistic effect, overcoming the inherent noise and biases of individual datasets.

**RQ2: What is the optimal statistical framework for weighing the contributions of different data modalities to maximize predictive power?** Not all evidence is equal. We will explore the extent to which different data types provide orthogonal versus redundant information. For instance, are PPI and co-expression data highly correlated, or do they capture distinct aspects of a protein's functional context? Our goal is to develop a Bayesian model that learns the relative predictive value of each modality, potentially in a context-dependent manner (e.g., structural data may be more informative for enzymes, while interaction data is more informative for scaffold proteins).

**RQ3: Can the systematic annotation of PUFs, placed within the context of known cellular networks, reveal novel protein complexes, functional modules, and previously unappreciated biological pathways?** Beyond annotating individual proteins, a key goal is to understand how PUFs fit into the larger cellular machinery. We will investigate whether our integrated functional linkage network, which connects proteins based on multi-modal evidence, can be partitioned to uncover new cellular components and pathways enriched with newly characterized PUFs.

**RQ4: How can AlphaFold-predicted structures be most effectively leveraged in a multi-modal framework to identify distant homologies and functional sites in PUFs that are undetectable by sequence-based methods?** We will explore whether combining structural similarity with network context (e.g., interaction partners, co-expressed genes) can disambiguate the function of proteins with common folds (e.g., TIM barrels) or pinpoint the specific biological process for a PUF that has structural similarity to a multi-functional protein family.

**Testable Hypotheses and Validation Strategies:**

**H1: A multi-modal Bayesian integration framework will achieve significantly higher performance in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms for proteins compared to state-of-the-art, single-modality prediction methods.**
*   **Prediction:** Our integrated model will demonstrate superior precision, recall, and F1-scores in a rigorous cross-validation benchmark against methods based solely on sequence homology (e.g., BLAST2GO), network topology (e.g., STRING), or structural similarity (e.g., FoldSeek).
*   **Validation:** We will employ a stringent validation protocol. First, we will use k-fold cross-validation on a 'gold standard' set of well-annotated proteins. More importantly, we will perform a time-split validation, training our model on annotations available up to a specific date (e.g., Jan 2022) and testing its ability to predict new annotations that have been experimentally validated and added to GO since then. This simulates true prospective prediction and provides a robust, unbiased measure of performance.

**H2: Integrating structural similarity networks with PPI and co-expression networks will reveal novel, functionally coherent protein modules that include one or more PUFs.**
*   **Prediction:** Applying community detection algorithms to our integrated, multi-layer network will identify clusters of proteins that are functionally enriched for specific biological processes (e.g., 'mRNA splicing'). We predict that many of these clusters will contain PUFs, whose membership in the cluster constitutes a high-confidence functional hypothesis.
*   **Validation:** The functional coherence of predicted modules will be statistically assessed using GO term enrichment analysis. For high-confidence predictions, we will perform in-depth literature searches for emerging, independent evidence that supports our functional assignment. The most compelling hypotheses will be presented to the community as prime candidates for experimental validation.

**H3: PUFs that exhibit strong evidence scores linking them to known disease-associated pathways are likely to be novel disease-implicated genes.**
*   **Prediction:** Our engine will identify PUFs whose integrated evidence profile (e.g., co-expression with cancer genes in tumor samples, physical interaction with proteins mutated in a specific disorder, and essentiality profiles similar to known drug targets) strongly connects them to specific disease pathways.
*   **Validation:** We will cross-reference our list of disease-implicated PUFs with independent genetic data from GWAS catalogs and clinical variant databases (e.g., ClinVar). The discovery of statistically significant disease-associated variants within the genes of our predicted PUFs will serve as powerful, independent validation of our functional hypotheses.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that requires a transdisciplinary working group and a phased, systematic approach to data integration, model development, and dissemination. The project will be executed over three years, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

**Working Group and Organization:**
The working group comprises three collaborating labs with complementary expertise: a bioinformatics and machine learning lab (PI 1) to lead the development of the Bayesian framework; a structural biology and proteomics lab (PI 2) to lead the processing and analysis of structural and interaction data; and a network and systems biology lab (PI 3) to lead the integration of network-based evidence and module discovery. The team will include two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students who will receive cross-disciplinary training. The group will operate under open science principles, with bi-weekly virtual meetings, two in-person workshops per year, and a shared project management platform (e.g., Slack, Asana). All code and analysis pipelines will be developed collaboratively in a version-controlled public GitHub repository.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Standardization, and Feature Engineering (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase focuses on assembling and processing the diverse public datasets. All data will be mapped to stable Ensembl and UniProt identifiers to ensure interoperability.
*   **Proteome Definition:** We will define the set of ~20,300 canonical human proteins from UniProt/Swiss-Prot and identify the target set of PUFs based on neXtProt evidence levels (PE2, PE3, PE4) and the absence of curated functional GO terms.
*   **Structural Data:** We will download all human protein structures from the AlphaFold Database. An all-vs-all structural similarity matrix will be computed using FoldSeek, providing a quantitative measure of structural relatedness for every protein pair. Structural domains will be annotated using InterProScan.
*   **Interaction Data:** Physical protein-protein interaction data will be aggregated from major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, and HuRI. Data will be filtered to retain only high-confidence interactions supported by multiple experiments or low-throughput methods, creating a unified PPI network.
*   **Co-expression Data:** We will process bulk RNA-seq data from the GTEx v8 release across 54 tissues and single-cell RNA-seq data from the Human Cell Atlas. For each context, we will compute a pairwise gene co-expression matrix using a robust correlation measure (e.g., Spearman's rank correlation).
*   **Phylogenetic Data:** We will generate phylogenetic profiles for every human protein by determining their presence or absence across a curated set of over 1,000 diverse species from the OrthoDB database. These binary vectors will be used to compute co-evolution scores for all protein pairs.
*   **Phenotypic Data:** Gene dependency scores from genome-wide CRISPR screens across ~1,000 cancer cell lines will be obtained from the DepMap portal. A phenotypic similarity score for each gene pair will be calculated based on the correlation of their dependency profiles.
*   **Gold Standard:** A 'gold standard' for training and validation will be constructed from the Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway databases, restricted to annotations with experimental or curated evidence codes (i.e., excluding IEA - Inferred from Electronic Annotation).

**Phase 2: Model Development and Validation (Months 10-21)**
This phase focuses on building and testing the core inference engine.
*   **Bayesian Integration Framework:** We will develop a Naive Bayes classifier, a well-established and interpretable framework for data integration. The model aims to calculate the posterior probability that two proteins, A and B, share a function (F) given the evidence from multiple data sources (D1, D2, ... Dn): P(F | D1...Dn). The model will be trained using our gold standard, where positive examples are protein pairs that share a specific GO term, and negative examples are pairs that do not. During training, the model will learn the likelihood distributions P(Di | F) for each data source, effectively learning the evidentiary weight of a given structural similarity score, co-expression value, etc.
*   **Model Training and Optimization:** The model will be trained on a subset of well-characterized proteins. We will optimize hyperparameters and feature representations using k-fold cross-validation. We will explicitly model data-source-specific biases and correlations to improve robustness.
*   **Inference and Annotation Transfer:** Once trained, the model will be applied to every pair of proteins involving at least one PUF. For each PUF, this will produce a ranked list of functionally related proteins. We will then use a network-based label propagation algorithm to transfer GO terms from these high-confidence neighbors to the PUF, generating a ranked list of probabilistic functional annotations.
*   **Validation:** The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated using the time-split validation strategy described in H1, providing an unbiased estimate of its predictive power on novel discoveries.

**Phase 3: Network Analysis, Dissemination, and Resource Deployment (Months 22-36)**
*   **Integrated Network Analysis:** We will construct a multi-layer network where nodes are proteins and edge weights are the posterior probabilities of functional linkage from our Bayesian model. We will apply the Leiden community detection algorithm to this network to identify novel functional modules (as per H2).
*   **Web Portal Development:** A major deliverable is a public, interactive web portal. Users will be able to search for any human protein, view its predicted functions with associated confidence scores, and explore the underlying evidence from each data modality through interactive network visualizations. All data and results will be fully downloadable.
*   **Dissemination:** Findings will be published in open-access journals and presented at international conferences. We will host webinars and create tutorials to train the community on using the portal and our open-source pipeline, which will be containerized using Docker and described with a Nextflow workflow for full reproducibility.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will produce a suite of tangible outcomes that will have a significant and lasting impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences, directly addressing the core goals of the NCEMS research call.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1.  **A Comprehensive, Probabilistic Functional Annotation of the Human 'Dark Proteome':** The primary outcome will be a database of high-confidence functional predictions for thousands of currently uncharacterized human proteins. Unlike existing resources that provide disparate or binary information, our annotations will be probabilistic, providing users with a quantitative measure of confidence for each prediction and detailing the contribution of each evidence type. We anticipate generating high-confidence (posterior probability > 0.75) hypotheses for at least 200-300 PUFs, and informative predictions for over a thousand more.

2.  **A Novel, Open-Source Multi-Modal Integration Framework:** We will deliver a robust, well-documented, and open-source computational pipeline for Bayesian data integration. This framework will be a significant methodological contribution, providing a template for researchers seeking to synthesize heterogeneous data types. Its modular design will allow other groups to adapt it for different organisms or to incorporate new data modalities as they become available.

3.  **A Publicly Accessible, Interactive Web Resource:** We will create and deploy the 'Human PUF Annotation Portal,' a dynamic web server that will become a go-to resource for the cell biology community. This portal will serve as the primary vehicle for disseminating our results, allowing any researcher to easily query their protein of interest and visualize the network of evidence supporting its functional annotation. This resource will lower the activation energy for investigating PUFs, empowering individual labs to pursue new research directions.

4.  **Discovery of Novel Biological Pathways and Protein Complexes:** Through our integrated network analysis, we expect to identify dozens of novel functional modules and propose new components for well-established cellular machinery. These discoveries, such as identifying a novel kinase in a signaling pathway or a new component of a DNA repair complex, will open up entirely new fields of biological inquiry.

**Broader Impact and Applications:**

*   **Accelerating the Pace of Biomedical Discovery:** This project will act as a catalyst for hypothesis-driven experimental research. By providing specific, testable hypotheses, we will enable experimental biologists to move directly to functional validation, saving years of preliminary work. A cancer researcher, for example, could use our portal to identify a novel PUF co-expressed with their oncogene of interest, immediately suggesting a new target for investigation. This will have a multiplicative effect on discovery across countless areas of human biology.

*   **Illuminating Disease Mechanisms and Identifying New Drug Targets:** Many PUFs are implicated in human disease through genome-wide association studies, but their lack of functional annotation has made them difficult to study. Our work will provide the crucial link between genetic association and molecular function. By identifying the enzymatic or signaling roles of these disease-associated PUFs, we will uncover novel mechanisms of pathology and highlight a vast, untapped space of potential therapeutic targets.

*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment that directly aligns with the NCEMS mission to develop a data-savvy workforce. Trainees will gain invaluable hands-on experience at the intersection of machine learning, network biology, structural bioinformatics, and open-source software development. They will learn to manage large-scale data, work in a collaborative team-science environment, and communicate complex results to a broad audience, skills that are in high demand in both academia and industry.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Sustainability:**
Our commitment to open science principles ensures maximum impact and longevity. All publications will be open-access. All code, data, and analysis workflows will be publicly available in repositories like GitHub and Zenodo. The web portal will be designed for long-term sustainability, hosted on stable cloud infrastructure. We will seek follow-on funding through NIH resource grants (R24) to support ongoing maintenance and periodic updates of the portal with new data, ensuring it remains a valuable and current community resource for years to come.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale, community-level synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of a single research laboratory or existing collaboration. The integration of petabyte-scale, heterogeneous datasets and the development of a sophisticated machine learning framework require a unique combination of expertise and dedicated resources that can only be assembled through a transdisciplinary working group as envisioned by the NCEMS program. NCEMS support is therefore essential to fund the dedicated personnel, computational infrastructure, and collaborative activities necessary for the project's success.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_03,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Predicting the Composition and Regulation of Biomolecular Condensates through Integrative Data Synthesis,"The formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an emergent principle of cellular organization, concentrating molecules to regulate biochemical reactions. However, the 'grammar' that dictates which proteins form condensates, their composition, and their regulation remains poorly defined. This project will assemble a working group of biophysicists, cell biologists, and data scientists to build a predictive model of the cellular 'condensatome'. We will synthesize a diverse array of public data, including: 1) Protein sequence features from UniProt, focusing on intrinsically disordered regions and low-complexity domains; 2) Post-translational modification (PTM) data from repositories like PhosphoSitePlus, as PTMs are key regulators of LLPS; 3) Experimentally determined and predicted protein structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB) to understand how structure influences phase separation; 4) High-content imaging data from resources like the Image Data Resource to identify proteins that co-localize in cellular puncta; and 5) Protein-protein interaction and co-expression data to infer condensate partnerships. The core of the project is to develop a suite of machine learning models that can predict a protein's propensity to phase separate, its likely interaction partners within a condensate, and the PTMs that regulate its assembly/disassembly. This synthesis will produce a comprehensive, predictive atlas of LLPS, providing a powerful tool for generating testable hypotheses about the role of condensates in health and disease.",,"Background And Significance

The compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells into membrane-bound organelles is a foundational concept in biology. However, recent discoveries have revealed an equally important mode of organization: the formation of membrane-less organelles, or biomolecular condensates, through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). These dynamic, protein- and RNA-rich assemblies, such as nucleoli, stress granules, and P-bodies, concentrate specific molecules to regulate a vast array of cellular processes, including transcription, RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and DNA repair. The physical principle underlying their formation is the ability of certain multivalent macromolecules to undergo phase separation, demixing from the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to form a distinct liquid phase. This emergent phenomenon represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular spatiotemporal organization. The field has rapidly advanced from initial observations to identifying key molecular drivers of LLPS. Seminal work has established that proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low-complexity domains (LCDs) are major drivers of phase separation. These regions lack stable tertiary structure and engage in a network of weak, transient, and multivalent interactions—such as cation-pi, pi-pi, and electrostatic interactions—that collectively drive condensate assembly. Several computational tools have been developed to predict LLPS propensity from protein sequences, leveraging features like amino acid composition, charge patterning, and predicted disorder (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE). While valuable, these first-generation predictors are often trained on limited datasets and primarily focus on sequence, neglecting other critical factors. Beyond sequence, post-translational modifications (PTMs) have emerged as a crucial regulatory layer. Phosphorylation, for instance, can dissolve condensates by introducing negative charges that disrupt electrostatic interactions, as seen with FUS and TDP-43, or promote assembly by creating new interaction motifs. Similarly, ubiquitination and acetylation can profoundly modulate the phase behavior of proteins. Furthermore, the composition of condensates is not static; it is a complex interplay between 'scaffold' proteins that drive phase separation and 'client' proteins that are recruited. Understanding this compositional logic is essential for deciphering condensate function. Despite this progress, significant gaps in our knowledge remain, presenting a formidable challenge that is perfectly suited for a community-scale data synthesis approach. First, we lack a unified, predictive 'grammar' for LLPS. Current knowledge is fragmented, and we cannot reliably predict, from its features alone, whether a given protein will phase separate, what its partners will be, and how its behavior will be regulated under different cellular conditions. Second, existing predictive models are limited in scope and accuracy because they fail to integrate the full spectrum of relevant biological data. Information on protein structure (from PDB and the revolutionary AlphaFold Database), PTMs (from PhosphoSitePlus), protein-protein interactions (from BioGRID), and subcellular localization (from the Human Protein Atlas and Image Data Resource) is publicly available but resides in disparate silos. No single research lab possesses the diverse expertise—in biophysics, cell biology, and data science—required to effectively mine, integrate, and synthesize these vast datasets. This project is both important and timely because the confluence of massive public data availability and advances in machine learning creates an unprecedented opportunity to address these fundamental questions. A comprehensive, predictive model of the cellular 'condensatome' would not only provide profound insights into the principles of cellular organization but also have significant biomedical implications. The dysregulation of biomolecular condensates is increasingly linked to a range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, as well as various cancers. By building a tool to generate testable hypotheses about condensate composition and regulation, this work will empower the broader scientific community to investigate the roles of LLPS in health and disease.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is organized around three central aims, each designed to deconstruct the complex 'grammar' of biomolecular condensates. By systematically integrating diverse public data, we will move beyond simple sequence-based prediction to build a multi-faceted, systems-level model of the cellular condensatome. Our approach is hypothesis-driven, with each prediction and model component subject to rigorous computational validation against orthogonal datasets and known biological ground truths. 

**Aim 1: To develop a comprehensive, multi-modal model for predicting a protein's intrinsic propensity to undergo LLPS.**
This aim addresses the fundamental question of which proteins in the proteome can phase separate. While current tools exist, they are limited by their reliance on primary sequence. We seek to create a next-generation predictor that incorporates a richer feature set.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can the integration of protein sequence, structure, and evolutionary conservation features significantly improve the accuracy and generalizability of LLPS propensity prediction?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A machine learning model trained on a synthesized feature set—encompassing sequence-derived properties (IDR length, amino acid composition, charge patterning), structural information (domain architecture, solvent accessibility from PDB/AlphaFold), and evolutionary data (conservation scores)—will exhibit superior performance (higher AUC-ROC and AUPRC) compared to existing state-of-the-art predictors when evaluated on a held-out, independent test set of experimentally validated proteins.
*   **Validation:** We will curate a gold-standard dataset from resources like PhaSepDB and DrLLPS. The model's performance will be rigorously benchmarked against at least three leading predictors using cross-validation and independent testing. We will also assess its ability to correctly classify proteins whose LLPS behavior is context-dependent, a known weakness of current tools.

**Aim 2: To predict the composition of specific biomolecular condensates by identifying scaffold-client relationships.**
A protein's LLPS behavior is not an isolated property; it occurs within a crowded cellular environment. This aim focuses on predicting the interaction partners that constitute a functional condensate.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** How can we leverage systems-level data, including protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, co-expression profiles, and co-localization imaging data, to predict the core (scaffold) and recruited (client) components of specific condensates?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** A network-based algorithm that integrates evidence from physical PPIs (BioGRID, STRING), functional associations (co-expression from GTEx), and spatial proximity (co-localization from the Image Data Resource) can accurately predict the composition of well-characterized condensates. We predict that true condensate members will form densely connected modules within this integrated network, distinguishable from random interactors.
*   **Validation:** We will test this hypothesis by applying our model to known scaffold proteins (e.g., G3BP1 for stress granules, NOP58 for the nucleolus). The model's ranked predictions of interaction partners will be statistically validated against experimentally determined proteomes of these specific condensates, using enrichment analyses (e.g., hypergeometric tests) to quantify the overlap.

**Aim 3: To model the regulatory role of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on condensate dynamics.**
Condensates are not static; they assemble and disassemble in response to cellular signals, often mediated by PTMs. This aim seeks to identify the specific PTMs that act as molecular switches.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can we identify sequence and structural features that distinguish PTMs that regulate LLPS from those that do not, thereby allowing us to predict regulatory 'hotspots'?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** PTMs that functionally modulate LLPS are non-randomly located in regions that directly impact the driving forces of phase separation. We hypothesize that a predictive model will identify features such as location within an IDR, proximity to key aromatic or charged residues, and the potential to alter local charge or steric hindrance as key determinants of a PTM's regulatory capacity.
*   **Validation:** We will compile a training set of PTMs with experimentally documented effects on LLPS from the literature and PhosphoSitePlus. Our classifier will be trained to distinguish these from other PTMs on the same proteins. The model's predictive power will be validated by its ability to rediscover known regulatory sites and by performing a literature-based validation of its novel, high-confidence predictions. For example, we will search for evidence that our predicted regulatory PTMs on a protein are linked to changes in its subcellular localization or function consistent with altered phase behavior. 

**Expected Deliverables:** The culmination of these aims will be a publicly accessible, integrated computational platform—the 'Condensatome Atlas'—providing predictions of LLPS propensity, condensate composition, and PTM-based regulation for any protein of interest. This will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation tool for the entire molecular and cellular biology community.

Methods And Approach

This project's success hinges on the tight integration of diverse expertise and a rigorous, phased computational strategy. Our working group comprises a data scientist (PI 1), a cell biologist with expertise in LLPS (PI 2), a postdoctoral fellow, and a graduate student. This structure ensures that cutting-edge computational methods are continuously guided by deep biological domain knowledge. The project will proceed through four major phases, with clear milestones and deliverables.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Integration (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase addresses the critical challenge of synthesizing heterogeneous public data into a unified, queryable resource. This task is beyond the scope of a single lab and requires the dedicated effort of our working group.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically download and process data from a curated list of public repositories. These include: (1) **Sequence & Intrinsic Features:** UniProt, DisProt, MobiDB; (2) **Structural Features:** Protein Data Bank (PDB), AlphaFold DB (v4); (3) **Post-Translational Modifications:** PhosphoSitePlus, dbPTM; (4) **Interaction & Functional Networks:** BioGRID, STRING, IntAct, and co-expression data from GTEx; (5) **Localization Data:** Human Protein Atlas, Image Data Resource (IDR); (6) **Ground-Truth LLPS Data:** PhaSepDB, DrLLPS, LLPSDB, supplemented by manual literature curation.
*   **Data Integration Pipeline:** We will develop a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to harmonize these datasets. All proteins will be mapped to stable UniProt identifiers. Data will be structured and stored in a PostgreSQL relational database, allowing for complex queries that link, for example, a specific PTM site to its structural context and known interaction partners. This integrated database is a key deliverable and a prerequisite for all subsequent modeling.

**Phase 2: Predictive Modeling of LLPS Propensity (Aim 1; Months 7-15)**
*   **Feature Engineering:** For each protein in the human proteome, we will generate a rich feature vector (~500 features) including: sequence composition (k-mers, amino acid indices), physicochemical properties (charge, hydropathy, aromaticity), disorder predictions (multiple algorithms), structural parameters derived from AlphaFold models (secondary structure content, solvent accessibility, pLDDT scores), and domain annotations (InterPro).
*   **Model Development and Training:** We will employ a gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) for our primary model due to its high performance and interpretability. We will train the model on our curated set of ~2,500 experimentally validated positive and negative examples. Model training will involve rigorous hyperparameter optimization using 10-fold cross-validation. To capture more complex relationships, we will also explore Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures that can naturally incorporate structural and PPI data.
*   **Model Interpretation:** We will use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze the trained XGBoost model. This will allow us to move beyond a 'black box' prediction and identify the specific combinations of features that drive LLPS, providing insights into the molecular grammar.

**Phase 3: Network-Based Prediction of Condensate Composition (Aim 2; Months 16-24)**
*   **Multi-Layer Network Construction:** We will build a weighted, integrated human protein network. Edge weights between two proteins will be a learned function of multiple evidence channels: physical interaction scores from STRING, co-expression correlation across GTEx tissues, and co-localization scores derived from Human Protein Atlas annotations.
*   **Composition Prediction Algorithm:** Using the LLPS propensity scores from Aim 1 to identify high-confidence 'scaffold' proteins, we will implement a network propagation algorithm (e.g., random walk with restart). The algorithm will propagate 'signal' from a known scaffold through the network, with the final scores on other nodes representing their predicted likelihood of being a client in that scaffold's condensate. The model will be trained and validated using known compositions of condensates like stress granules and P-bodies.

**Phase 4: Modeling PTM Regulation and Platform Deployment (Aim 3 & Final Deliverable; Months 25-36)**
*   **PTM Regulatory Model:** For each PTM site in PhosphoSitePlus, we will generate features describing its local environment: sequence context (±10 residues), structural context (secondary structure, accessibility), and proximity to IDRs and functional domains. A logistic regression or shallow neural network will be trained to classify PTMs with known regulatory effects on LLPS.
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   M6: Completion of integrated database.
    *   M12: First version of LLPS propensity predictor (LLPS-Pro) benchmarked and internally validated.
    *   M18: Manuscript on LLPS-Pro submitted. Development of network integration method initiated.
    *   M24: Condensate composition predictor validated against known proteomes.
    *   M30: PTM regulatory model developed. Work begins on web portal integration.
    *   M36: Public launch of the 'Condensatome Atlas' web portal. Final project manuscript submitted.
*   **Open Science:** All code will be developed in a public GitHub repository with version control. All curated datasets and final trained models will be deposited on Zenodo. This ensures full reproducibility and community access, aligning with the core principles of this research call.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology. By synthesizing a vast and diverse array of public data, we will create not just new knowledge, but also powerful new tools and resources that will catalyze research across the community. Our impact will be felt through direct scientific contributions, broader applications in medicine and technology, and the training of a new generation of data-savvy biologists.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **The 'Condensatome Atlas': A Definitive Community Resource.** The primary outcome will be a comprehensive, publicly accessible web portal that provides a multi-layered view of the cellular condensatome. For any protein of interest, users will be able to retrieve its predicted LLPS propensity, a ranked list of potential interaction partners within condensates, and a map of PTMs predicted to regulate its phase behavior. This will be an invaluable hypothesis-generation tool, enabling experimentalists to design more targeted and informed studies. Unlike static databases, our atlas will be a dynamic platform with a clear framework for future updates.
2.  **A New Standard for Predictive Modeling.** Our work will establish a new paradigm for predicting emergent cellular behaviors. By demonstrating the power of integrating sequence, structure, interaction, and regulatory data, we will move the field beyond simplistic, single-modality models. The methodologies we develop for data integration and machine learning will be broadly applicable to other complex biological questions.
3.  **Fundamental Insights into the 'Grammar' of LLPS.** Through interpretable machine learning, we will dissect the complex interplay of molecular features that govern phase separation. We expect to uncover novel sequence motifs, structural arrangements, and regulatory patterns that constitute the 'grammar' of LLPS. This will provide fundamental knowledge about how cells use phase separation to organize their interior and regulate their functions, addressing a long-standing puzzle in cell biology.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Therapeutic Hypothesis Generation:** The dysregulation of biomolecular condensates is a pathogenic mechanism in numerous diseases, including neurodegeneration (e.g., ALS, Alzheimer's) and cancer. Our Condensatome Atlas will allow researchers to investigate the impact of disease-associated mutations on LLPS propensity or predict how oncogenic signaling pathways might alter condensate composition through PTMs. This will open new avenues for identifying therapeutic targets and developing novel treatment strategies.
*   **Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** A quantitative understanding of the rules governing LLPS will empower the rational design of synthetic proteins and cells. This knowledge can be harnessed to create novel biomaterials, engineer artificial organelles for metabolic engineering, or develop new drug delivery systems based on phase-separating peptides.

**Follow-up Research and Collaborations:**
This synthesis project is inherently collaborative and designed to spark new research directions. The predictions generated by our models will serve as a rich source of testable hypotheses for the experimental community. We will actively disseminate our high-confidence predictions and seek collaborations with experimental labs to validate them using techniques such as in vitro reconstitution, cellular imaging, and proteomics. The working group itself will form a lasting collaborative hub, ideally positioned to pursue new funding for experimental validation of our most exciting findings.

**Dissemination and Training:**
We are committed to open science and broad dissemination. Our findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. All code, data, and models will be made publicly available. The Condensatome Atlas web portal will be our primary vehicle for sharing our results with the broadest possible audience. Furthermore, in line with the research call's mission, this project provides an exceptional training environment. The postdoctoral fellow and graduate student will gain rare, cross-disciplinary expertise in computational biology, data science, and cell biology, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy workforce. We will also develop and share training materials and host workshops at national meetings to enable other researchers to use our tools and adopt our data synthesis approaches.

This project seeks to computationally reconstruct the protein-protein interaction network (interactome) of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) to understand the molecular origins of eukaryotic complexity. This requires a massive data synthesis effort far beyond the scope of any single lab. Our working group, composed of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and computational scientists, will integrate data from hundreds of genomes and proteomes spanning all major eukaryotic supergroups (including under-sampled protist lineages), Asgard archaea (the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes), and other prokaryotes. The methodology will involve: 1) Orthology inference to identify protein families present in LECA; 2) Ancestral sequence reconstruction to approximate LECA protein sequences; and 3) Integration of experimentally determined interactomes from diverse model organisms (e.g., yeast, human, fly) with structural modeling and co-evolutionary analyses to infer ancestral protein interactions. By comparing the reconstructed LECA interactome with those of modern prokaryotes, we will pinpoint the key molecular innovations—such as the emergence of the ubiquitin system, the nuclear pore complex, and the endomembrane system—that enabled the rise of cellular complexity. This project will provide a foundational model of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, offering deep insights into the emergence of its defining features.",,"Background And Significance

The origin of the eukaryotic cell, a watershed event in the history of life, marks the transition from simple prokaryotic life to organisms of vastly greater structural and regulatory complexity. This transition, which occurred over a billion years ago, laid the foundation for the evolution of all multicellular life, including plants, animals, and fungi. While the endosymbiotic origin of the mitochondrion is well-established, the identity of the host cell and the sequence of events that led to the emergence of defining eukaryotic features—such as the nucleus, a dynamic cytoskeleton, and an intricate endomembrane system—remain central, unresolved questions in biology. For decades, our understanding of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) was based on extrapolations from a few model organisms. However, the recent explosion in genome sequencing, particularly from diverse microbial eukaryotes (protists) and the discovery of the Asgard archaea as the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, has revolutionized the field. Comparative genomic studies have successfully reconstructed a substantial portion of the LECA proteome, revealing that it was already a remarkably complex cell, possessing thousands of proteins involved in sophisticated cellular processes. Key studies have established that LECA likely contained core machinery for membrane trafficking (e.g., ESCRT complexes), ubiquitin-based signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and a primitive nuclear pore complex. This has provided us with a detailed 'parts list' of the ancestral eukaryotic cell. However, a parts list is not a blueprint. The critical gap in our knowledge is understanding how these components worked together. We lack a systems-level view of the ancestral cell's functional organization. The protein-protein interaction network, or interactome, represents the 'wiring diagram' that dictates cellular function. While interactomes have been mapped for several modern model organisms like yeast and humans, these represent endpoints of over a billion years of evolution. Extrapolating backwards from these modern networks is fraught with difficulty due to extensive divergence, gene loss, and lineage-specific adaptations. Previous attempts to study interactome evolution have been limited, often comparing only a few species or focusing on small, well-conserved protein complexes. There has been no systematic, large-scale effort to reconstruct an ancestral interactome from the ground up by synthesizing the full breadth of available genomic, proteomic, and structural data. This project is both important and timely because we are at a unique confluence of data availability and methodological advancement. The proliferation of publicly available genomes from previously unsampled eukaryotic lineages (e.g., via the EukProt database) and Asgard archaea provides the necessary phylogenetic breadth and a crucial prokaryotic outgroup. The maturation of large-scale experimental PPI datasets (e.g., BioGRID, IntAct) provides the raw material for inferring ancestral connections. Furthermore, revolutionary advances in computational methods, such as accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold and sophisticated algorithms for detecting co-evolution, now make it possible to infer and validate ancestral interactions with unprecedented confidence. By synthesizing these disparate data types, this project will move beyond the LECA 'parts list' to construct its 'wiring diagram'. This will provide a foundational model of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, enabling us to address fundamental questions about the emergence of its defining features and the principles governing the evolution of cellular complexity.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses the overarching question: How did the architecture of the protein-protein interaction network evolve during the origin of the eukaryotic cell to generate a new level of cellular complexity? To tackle this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research aims, each with testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes. 

**Aim 1: Reconstruct the high-confidence protein-protein interactome of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA).** This aim moves beyond identifying the genes present in LECA to determining how their protein products functioned together. 
*   **Research Question 1.1:** What was the global topology—the size, density, and modularity—of the LECA interactome? 
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** The LECA interactome was significantly larger and more densely connected than that of its prokaryotic progenitors, reflecting a quantum leap in functional integration. We hypothesize that this network was organized into distinct modules corresponding to nascent eukaryotic organelles and systems. 
*   **Prediction 1.1:** Our reconstructed LECA network will exhibit a power-law degree distribution characteristic of modern biological networks but will have a higher average clustering coefficient and a more modular structure than a similarly reconstructed Asgard archaeal interactome. We will identify distinct network communities enriched for proteins associated with functions like nuclear transport, endomembrane trafficking, and chromatin modification. 

**Aim 2: Identify the key network innovations that distinguish the LECA interactome from its prokaryotic antecedents.** This aim seeks to pinpoint the specific changes in the cellular 'wiring diagram' that drove the emergence of eukaryotic complexity. 
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Which protein interactions and network motifs were novel to LECA, and how were pre-existing prokaryotic proteins rewired into new eukaryotic-specific pathways? 
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** Eukaryogenesis was driven by a dual process: the 'invention' of new hub proteins that organized novel cellular machinery, and the 'co-option' of conserved prokaryotic proteins into new interaction contexts. 
*   **Prediction 2.1:** A differential network analysis comparing the LECA and Asgard interactomes will reveal a cohort of LECA-specific proteins (e.g., early nucleoporins, ESCRT components, ubiquitin ligases) that act as high-connectivity hubs. Furthermore, we predict that conserved proteins with prokaryotic orthologs (e.g., actin, tubulin, ESCRT-III homologs) will show a significant gain of new interaction partners in the LECA network, linking them to eukaryotic-specific functions. 

**Aim 3: Model the ancestral interaction networks of key eukaryotic innovations.** We will focus on three systems central to the eukaryotic identity: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and the endomembrane system. 
*   **Research Question 3.1:** How did the components of these systems assemble into coherent, functional interaction modules in LECA? 
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** The ancestral UPS emerged as a master regulatory network by forming connections to a wide array of substrates in pre-existing pathways. The ancestral NPC and endomembrane system formed as physically and functionally integrated modules through a dense web of newly evolved interactions. 
*   **Prediction 3.1:** The reconstructed ubiquitin-centric subnetwork in LECA will connect ubiquitin ligases to proteins involved in chromatin, transcription, and membrane trafficking, functions not regulated by such a system in prokaryotes. The subnetwork of LECA nucleoporins will form a highly interconnected module, distinct from the simpler membrane-coating complexes found in Asgard archaea. 

**Validation Strategy:** Our hypotheses will be tested through rigorous computational and statistical analysis. Network topology predictions will be tested using standard network science metrics. Inferred interactions will be validated internally using a multi-evidence scoring scheme; high-confidence predictions will be further tested for structural plausibility using AlphaFold-Multimer to model the ancestral protein complexes. The conservation of inferred ancestral interactions across diverse modern eukaryotic lineages will provide an independent line of phylogenetic validation.

Methods And Approach

This project is a large-scale data synthesis effort that will be executed in four integrated phases by a multidisciplinary working group. Our approach is designed to be modular, reproducible, and transparent, adhering to the highest standards of open science. 

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Curation and Orthology Inference (Months 1-6)** 
*   **Data Sources:** We will synthesize data from multiple public repositories. 
    *   **Genomic/Proteomic Data:** We will assemble a dataset of over 700 proteomes, including all available high-quality eukaryotic genomes from NCBI and Ensembl, with a special focus on deep phylogenetic sampling using the EukProt database to include diverse protist lineages. For our prokaryotic outgroup, we will include all available Asgard archaeal genomes and a representative set of over 200 other archaeal and bacterial genomes. 
    *   **Interaction Data:** We will compile a comprehensive database of experimentally determined protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from BioGRID, IntAct, and STRING for multiple model eukaryotes (H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, C. elegans). We will filter these data to retain only high-confidence interactions supported by direct physical evidence. 
    *   **Structural Data:** We will utilize experimentally determined structures from the PDB and the comprehensive set of predicted structures from the AlphaFold DB. 
*   **Orthology and Phylogeny:** We will use the graph-based algorithm OrthoFinder to delineate orthologous groups (OGs) across all 700+ species. For each OG, we will build a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE. These trees will be used to precisely identify the set of OGs that were present in LECA and to resolve one-to-one orthologs between species, which is critical for subsequent analyses. A robust species tree will be constructed from a concatenated alignment of ~100 conserved, single-copy proteins to serve as the scaffold for ancestral reconstruction. 

**Phase 2: Ancestral Sequence and Proteome Reconstruction (Months 7-12)** 
*   **Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR):** For each OG determined to be present in LECA, we will perform ASR. Using the OG's multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree, we will use a maximum-likelihood method (e.g., PAML or PhyloBot) to infer the most probable amino acid sequence of the LECA protein. We will quantify uncertainty by calculating posterior probabilities for each amino acid at each site. This process will yield the first high-fidelity reconstruction of the LECA proteome. 

**Phase 3: Ancestral Interactome Inference (Months 13-24)** 
This core phase uses a multi-pronged, evidence-integration approach to reconstruct the LECA interactome. We will infer potential interactions and assign a confidence score to each based on a weighted combination of the following four methods: 
1.  **Interolog Mapping:** We will map known interactions from modern model organisms onto the LECA proteome. An interaction is inferred if both interacting partners in a modern species have clear orthologs in our reconstructed LECA proteome. This forms our baseline network. 
2.  **Co-evolutionary Analysis:** We will search for correlated evolutionary histories between pairs of protein families. This will involve two computationally intensive methods: i) MirrorTree, which assesses the similarity of the phylogenetic trees of two protein families, and ii) Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), which identifies co-evolving residue pairs across concatenated multiple sequence alignments. Strong co-evolutionary signals are powerful predictors of direct physical interaction. 
3.  **Structural Modeling of Ancestral Complexes:** For pairs of LECA proteins predicted to interact by other methods, we will use their reconstructed ancestral sequences as input for AlphaFold-Multimer. A high-confidence structural prediction of the complex, with a well-defined interface and low predicted aligned error (PAE), will provide strong, independent evidence for a direct physical interaction. This step is crucial for validating and refining our network. 
4.  **Domain-Interaction Context:** We will leverage databases of known domain-domain interactions (e.g., 3did). An interaction will be inferred if two LECA proteins contain domains that are known to mediate interactions in modern proteins. 
*   **Network Integration:** Evidence from these four streams will be integrated using a Bayesian framework to calculate a final confidence score for each potential interaction. This allows us to generate interactome maps at various confidence thresholds for robust downstream analysis. 

**Phase 4: Comparative Network Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Months 25-36)** 
*   **Prokaryotic Ancestral Interactome:** We will apply the exact same pipeline to reconstruct the interactome of the last Asgard archaeal common ancestor, providing a direct, high-quality prokaryotic network for comparison. 
*   **Network Analysis:** Using computational tools like NetworkX and Cytoscape, we will perform a detailed comparative analysis of the LECA and Asgard interactomes. We will test our hypotheses by comparing global network properties (degree distribution, modularity, path lengths), identifying novel LECA hubs, and mapping the rewiring of conserved proteins. We will use community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain) to identify functional modules and perform enrichment analyses based on the protein domains within each module to functionally annotate them (e.g., 'ancestral kinetochore', 'ancestral Golgi/ER transport'). 

**Timeline & Milestones:** 
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data curation, orthology inference, and ancestral sequence reconstruction. **Milestone:** A publicly released, high-quality LECA proteome. 
*   **Year 2:** Development and execution of the multi-evidence interactome inference pipeline. **Milestone:** A first-draft, scored LECA interactome and Asgard interactome. 
*   **Year 3:** Comparative network analysis, hypothesis testing, structural validation of key complexes, and dissemination. **Milestones:** Final, validated ancestral interactomes; public web portal for data exploration; submission of primary manuscripts.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of evolutionary biology, cell biology, and systems biology. Its impact will extend from providing a foundational resource for the scientific community to training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. 

**Expected Outcomes:** 
1.  **The First Comprehensive LECA Interactome:** The primary deliverable will be a high-confidence, computationally reconstructed protein-protein interaction network for the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. This 'wiring diagram' of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, delivered via an interactive public web portal, will be a durable and invaluable resource. It will allow researchers to explore the ancestral context of their favorite proteins, visualize the architecture of primordial cellular machinery, and generate novel, testable hypotheses about the function and evolution of eukaryotic systems. 
2.  **Deep Insights into the Origin of Eukaryotic Complexity:** By systematically comparing the LECA interactome with that of its closest prokaryotic relatives, we will move beyond speculation to data-driven inference about the emergence of eukaryotic features. Our analysis will pinpoint the specific interactions and network modules that were gained or rewired during eukaryogenesis, providing concrete models for the assembly of the nucleus, the endomembrane system, the cytoskeleton, and complex regulatory networks like the ubiquitin system. 
3.  **A Novel and Powerful Methodological Framework:** We will develop and validate an innovative, open-source computational pipeline for ancestral network reconstruction. This integrative framework, which combines phylogenomics, co-evolutionary analysis, and cutting-edge structural modeling, will be a significant methodological contribution. It will be broadly applicable to the study of other major evolutionary transitions and the evolution of other complex biological networks. 

**Broader Impacts and Alignment with Research Call:** 
This project is perfectly aligned with the funding organization's mission. It is a community-scale synthesis project that tackles a fundamental question in molecular and cellular biosciences using exclusively publicly available data. 
*   **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** The project's success hinges on the deep integration of expertise from our working group, which includes evolutionary genomicists, cell biologists, and computational network scientists. This transdisciplinary environment is essential for interpreting the results and is beyond the capacity of any single lab. 
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** The project will provide an exceptional training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will be embedded in a collaborative, multi-lab environment and will gain highly sought-after skills in big data analysis, comparative genomics, network biology, and structural bioinformatics. We will host an annual workshop for the working group to share methods and foster collaboration, directly contributing to a future data-savvy scientific workforce. 
*   **Commitment to Open Science:** We are fundamentally committed to open, reproducible, and transparent science. All analysis scripts and workflows will be version-controlled and shared on GitHub. All derived data, including alignments, ancestral sequences, and the final network models, will be deposited in Zenodo. The final interactome will be made fully accessible through a user-friendly web portal, ensuring its broad use and long-term impact. 

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:** 
We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, with plans for a flagship paper describing the LECA interactome and several follow-up studies on specific subcellular systems. We will also present our work at major international conferences (e.g., Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, American Society for Cell Biology). The long-term vision is for this project to serve as a cornerstone for a new field of 'paleo-proteomics'. The reconstructed ancestral proteins can be synthesized for in vitro biochemical characterization, experimentally validating our computational predictions. This project lays the groundwork for reconstructing the evolutionary trajectory of the interactome across the entire tree of life, providing a dynamic movie of cellular evolution rather than a single snapshot.

Budget And Resources

The project requires the integration of hundreds of genomes and proteomes, petabyte-scale data storage, and millions of CPU hours for phylogenetic, co-evolutionary, and structural analyses. Furthermore, the transdisciplinary nature of the research questions necessitates a dedicated working group that combines expertise in evolutionary genomics, cell biology, network theory, and structural bioinformatics. Support from NCEMS is therefore essential to provide the personnel, computational infrastructure, and collaborative framework required for the project's success.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_05,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Mapping Conserved and Tumor-Specific Metabolic Vulnerabilities through Synthesis of Pan-Cancer Multi-Omics Data,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, but the sheer diversity of tumors has made it difficult to distinguish between universal metabolic dependencies and those specific to a given cancer type or genetic background. This project will create a comprehensive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas by synthesizing multi-omics and clinical data from public repositories, including TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC. The working group, with expertise in cancer biology, metabolism, bioinformatics, and systems modeling, will develop a unified pipeline to process and integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data from over 20,000 tumor samples. Using this integrated dataset, we will employ genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs) and machine learning to: 1) Construct context-specific metabolic models for every major cancer subtype; 2) Identify a core set of metabolic reactions and pathways that are consistently dysregulated across most cancers, representing robust therapeutic targets; 3) Uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities that are linked to specific driver mutations or tissue-of-origin effects; and 4) Correlate metabolic phenotypes with clinical outcomes and drug response data. This community-scale synthesis will generate a powerful resource for the field, providing a systems-level view of cancer metabolism that can guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies.",,"Background And Significance

The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a foundational hallmark of cancer, enabling the rapid proliferation and survival of tumor cells in diverse microenvironments. First observed by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, this phenomenon, characterized by elevated glucose uptake and lactate production even in the presence of oxygen, is now understood to be part of a much broader metabolic rewiring. This rewiring supports not only energy production but also the biosynthesis of macromolecules (nucleotides, lipids, amino acids) and the maintenance of redox homeostasis, all of which are critical for cell growth and division. Seminal studies have elucidated key metabolic pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer, including aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), glutaminolysis, and fatty acid synthesis. These alterations are often driven by the same oncogenes (e.g., MYC, PI3K/AKT) and tumor suppressors (e.g., p53, LKB1) that control cell cycle and apoptosis, highlighting the deep integration of metabolism with core cancer signaling networks.

Despite this progress, our understanding of cancer metabolism remains fragmented. Much of the foundational work has been conducted in specific cancer cell lines or mouse models, which may not fully capture the metabolic heterogeneity observed in human tumors. Pan-cancer analyses, which study multiple cancer types simultaneously, have begun to address this, revealing both shared and distinct metabolic features. For instance, analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomic data have successfully clustered tumors based on their metabolic gene expression profiles, linking them to specific mutations and clinical outcomes. However, these studies have significant limitations. Most rely predominantly on transcriptomic data, which is an imperfect proxy for enzymatic activity, as protein levels and metabolic fluxes are regulated by complex post-transcriptional, translational, and allosteric mechanisms. The integration of proteomic and metabolomic data is essential for a more accurate depiction of the metabolic state, but such multi-omic integration at a pan-cancer scale has been technically challenging and rarely attempted.

A critical unanswered question in the field is the extent to which metabolic vulnerabilities are conserved across different cancer types versus being context-dependent. Identifying a core set of metabolic dependencies shared by most tumors could lead to the development of broad-spectrum therapies effective against a wide range of malignancies. Conversely, understanding the unique metabolic liabilities imposed by a specific driver mutation (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations in glioma and AML) or a particular tissue of origin (e.g., the unique reliance of clear cell renal carcinoma on glycogen and lipid metabolism) is the cornerstone of precision medicine. Currently, there is no systematic, large-scale resource that maps this landscape of conserved and specific metabolic vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of human cancers.

This research is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the public availability of massive, high-quality multi-omics datasets from consortia like TCGA, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) provides an unprecedented opportunity for data synthesis. For the first time, we have genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and, in some cases, metabolomic data for thousands of patient tumors. Second, computational methods, particularly genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs), have matured to a point where they can integrate these multi-omic data layers to simulate cellular metabolism with increasing accuracy. Third, the clinical pipeline for metabolic drugs is growing, yet their efficacy is often limited to specific patient subsets, underscoring the urgent need for biomarkers to guide their use. This project directly addresses these gaps by proposing a community-scale synthesis effort that leverages these public data and advanced computational tools to create a definitive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas. This resource will provide a systems-level understanding of cancer metabolism, distinguishing universal principles from context-specific adaptations and thereby accelerating the development of more effective metabolic therapies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is organized around four central research aims designed to systematically map the landscape of cancer metabolism. Each aim poses a fundamental question and is associated with a specific, testable hypothesis that will be addressed through the synthesis of pan-cancer multi-omics data.

**Aim 1: To construct a comprehensive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas by generating context-specific metabolic models for all major cancer subtypes.**
*   **Research Question:** Can we develop a robust and scalable computational pipeline to integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from over 20,000 tumors to build accurate, patient-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs)?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that metabolic models constrained by integrated multi-omics data, particularly proteomics, will more accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and functional states than models based on transcriptomics alone. We predict that this approach will reveal distinct and coherent metabolic clusters both within and across cancer types, reflecting their underlying biology.
*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** The accuracy of our models will be validated in several ways. First, we will assess their ability to recapitulate known metabolic hallmarks of specific cancers (e.g., high lactate secretion in glycolytic tumors, 2-hydroxyglutarate production in IDH1-mutant gliomas). Second, where available, we will compare model-predicted reaction fluxes with experimentally measured metabolic flux data from published studies on relevant cell lines. Third, we will evaluate the internal consistency of the models by correlating predicted metabolic pathway activities with the expression levels of key regulatory enzymes.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The primary deliverable for this aim is the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas itself: a collection of over 20,000 context-specific GEMs, forming a foundational resource for the subsequent aims and the broader research community.

**Aim 2: To identify a core set of conserved metabolic reactions and pathways that represent pan-cancer vulnerabilities.**
*   **Research Question:** Across the vast heterogeneity of human cancers, is there a conserved set of metabolic enzymes and pathways that are consistently essential for tumor cell survival and proliferation, regardless of tissue of origin or genetic driver?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a core set of metabolic dependencies exists, centered on essential biomass precursor synthesis (e.g., nucleotide and amino acid synthesis) and redox balance (e.g., the pentose phosphate pathway and glutathione metabolism). We predict that the enzymes governing these pathways represent robust, high-priority targets for broad-spectrum metabolic therapies.
*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** Using our atlas of GEMs, we will perform in silico essentiality screens (e.g., simulating single gene/reaction knockouts) for every model. Reactions or genes predicted to be essential in a statistically significant majority of tumors (>90%) will be defined as 'core dependencies'. We will validate this list of predicted essential genes by cross-referencing it with large-scale experimental CRISPR/Cas9 essentiality datasets, such as the DepMap project, to confirm their functional importance in cancer cell lines.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A high-confidence, ranked list of conserved metabolic enzyme targets, annotated with multi-omic evidence and functional genomics data, that can guide the development of pan-cancer therapeutic strategies.

**Aim 3: To uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities linked to genetic drivers and tissue-of-origin.**
*   **Research Question:** How do specific oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, BRAF, IDH1, VHL) and the cellular lineage of a tumor shape its metabolic network to create unique, context-dependent liabilities?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that distinct metabolic phenotypes are strongly coupled to the genetic and lineage context of a tumor. We predict that our models will identify specific metabolic pathways that are uniquely upregulated and essential in tumors with a given driver mutation (e.g., a dependency on reductive carboxylation in tumors with mitochondrial dysfunction) or from a specific tissue (e.g., steroidogenesis in adrenal cancers).
*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** We will employ a range of machine learning and statistical methods to associate predicted metabolic fluxes with mutation status, copy number alterations, and cancer type. For example, we will use regression models to identify metabolic reactions whose activity is significantly correlated with the presence of a KRAS mutation across all cancer types. These associations will be validated against the extensive body of literature on mutation-specific metabolic reprogramming.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A comprehensive map linking key cancer drivers and tissues of origin to their predicted metabolic dependencies, providing a rational basis for developing personalized metabolic therapies.

**Aim 4: To correlate metabolic phenotypes with clinical outcomes and therapeutic response.**
*   **Research Question:** Can the metabolic signatures derived from our models serve as biomarkers to predict patient prognosis (e.g., survival, recurrence) or the response to specific anti-cancer drugs?
*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that distinct metabolic states, such as a 'highly glycolytic' versus a 'highly oxidative' phenotype, will be significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we predict that the activity of specific metabolic pathways can predict sensitivity or resistance to both metabolic inhibitors and conventional chemotherapies that are metabolically-linked (e.g., antifolates like methotrexate).
*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** We will use survival analysis models (Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards) to test for significant associations between model-predicted reaction fluxes and patient survival data from TCGA. To investigate therapeutic response, we will correlate our predicted metabolic phenotypes with large-scale drug sensitivity screens from cancer cell line encyclopedias (e.g., GDSC, CCLE), identifying metabolic predictors of drug efficacy.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A set of novel, validated metabolic biomarkers with the potential to stratify patients for prognosis and guide therapeutic decisions.

Methods And Approach

This project will execute a systematic, multi-stage plan to synthesize public multi-omics data into a comprehensive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas. Our approach is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and transparent, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group.

**Data Acquisition and Harmonization**
The foundation of this project is the aggregation and harmonization of publicly available data. We will source data primarily from three major consortia:
1.  **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):** We will download processed somatic mutation data (VCFs), copy number variation (CNV) data, and normalized RNA-Seq expression data for approximately 11,000 tumors across 33 cancer types from the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
2.  **Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC):** We will acquire processed, normalized mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics data for over 1,500 tumors, which largely overlap with the TCGA cohort, providing a critical layer of protein-level information.
3.  **International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC):** We will incorporate data from the ICGC Data Portal to expand our cohort size and increase the diversity of cancer types, adding several thousand additional tumor samples with genomic and transcriptomic data.
Associated clinical data, including patient survival, tumor stage, grade, and treatment history, will be downloaded from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. All data will be aggregated into a unified data matrix. A rigorous harmonization pipeline will be developed to handle batch effects and normalize data from different sources, ensuring comparability across the entire cohort of over 20,000 samples. This will involve standardized data processing scripts and statistical normalization techniques (e.g., ComBat for batch correction).

**Computational Pipeline for Model Construction and Analysis**
Our analytical workflow is centered on the construction and interrogation of context-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).

**Step 1: Construction of Context-Specific GEMs.** We will start with the most recent, comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon3D, as our template model. For each of the ~20,000 tumor samples, we will generate a context-specific model using an algorithm that integrates multi-omics data. We will employ the GIMME algorithm or a similar method, which prunes the generic network based on gene expression data to retain only active reactions. Crucially, we will extend this framework to incorporate proteomics data from the CPTAC cohort. Protein abundance levels will be used to directly constrain the upper bounds of the corresponding enzymatic reaction fluxes, a method known as building enzyme-constrained models (ecGEMs). This integration of proteomics is a key innovation of our approach, as it provides a more direct measure of enzyme capacity than transcript levels alone. This entire process will be automated in a high-throughput pipeline to generate a unique metabolic model for every tumor sample.

**Step 2: Analysis of Conserved Vulnerabilities (Aim 2).** To identify pan-cancer dependencies, we will perform a systematic in silico knockout screen on each of the 20,000 models. Using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we will simulate the removal of each gene and reaction in the network and calculate the effect on a cellular objective function, such as biomass production (a proxy for proliferation). Genes whose removal is predicted to be lethal (i.e., reduces biomass production below a threshold) in a high percentage of models across all cancer types will be classified as core pan-cancer essential genes. We will use permutation testing to assess the statistical significance of our findings.

**Step 3: Analysis of Specific Vulnerabilities (Aim 3).** To link metabolic phenotypes to genetic and lineage context, we will use a machine learning approach. We will treat the predicted flux values for all metabolic reactions in our models as a feature set. We will then train classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to predict the mutation status of key cancer drivers (e.g., KRAS, IDH1, VHL) or the tissue of origin based on these metabolic features. Feature importance scores from these models will highlight the specific metabolic reactions that are most distinctive of each context, representing potential targeted vulnerabilities.

**Step 4: Correlation with Clinical Data (Aim 4).** We will perform two main analyses. First, for survival analysis, we will use Cox proportional hazards models to identify metabolic reactions whose predicted fluxes are significantly associated with patient overall survival or progression-free survival, while controlling for confounding variables like tumor stage and age. Second, to predict drug response, we will build regression models that link metabolic features to drug sensitivity (IC50) data in cancer cell lines (from GDSC/CCLE) and then apply these predictive models to our tumor data to infer patient-specific drug sensitivities.

**Timeline and Milestones**
*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Assemble the working group. Finalize data acquisition from TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC. Develop and validate the data harmonization and model-building pipeline. Generate the first iteration of ~20,000 transcriptomics-based GEMs. Hold a training workshop for all trainees on the computational pipeline. **Milestone: Pipeline established and first-pass models generated.**
*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Integrate proteomics data to refine models into ecGEMs for the CPTAC cohort. Complete the analyses for Aim 2 (conserved vulnerabilities) and Aim 3 (specific vulnerabilities). Begin drafting the first manuscript. Present preliminary findings at a national conference. **Milestone: Completion of core and specific vulnerability analyses.**
*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36):** Complete the analysis for Aim 4 (clinical correlations). Develop and launch the public web portal for the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas, allowing community access to data and models. Finalize and submit manuscripts for publication. Disseminate tools and findings through workshops and conference presentations. **Milestone: Public launch of the Atlas and submission of primary manuscripts.**

This project's scale and multidisciplinary nature, requiring expertise in bioinformatics, systems biology, cancer genomics, and machine learning, make it an ideal fit for the NCEMS working group model, as it far exceeds the capabilities of any single research lab.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will yield significant outcomes that will have a transformative impact on the fields of cancer biology, metabolism, and computational systems biology. Our contributions will be multifaceted, spanning the creation of a major community resource, the generation of novel biological insights, the identification of therapeutic targets, and the training of a new generation of data-savvy scientists.

**Key Deliverables and Scientific Contributions:**
1.  **The Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas:** The primary outcome will be a publicly accessible, comprehensive resource comprising over 20,000 context-specific metabolic models of human tumors. This Atlas, disseminated through an intuitive web portal, will allow researchers worldwide to query metabolic pathway activity across dozens of cancer types, explore relationships between genetic alterations and metabolic phenotypes, and download models and data for their own analyses. This will be an enduring resource that democratizes the use of systems biology approaches in cancer research and will serve as a foundational dataset for countless future studies.
2.  **A Definitive Map of Conserved vs. Specific Metabolic Dependencies:** By systematically analyzing this unprecedented collection of models, we will provide the first comprehensive, data-driven answer to a fundamental question in cancer metabolism: which vulnerabilities are universal, and which are context-specific? This will resolve long-standing debates and provide a clear framework for thinking about metabolic therapies, guiding the development of both broad-spectrum and precision medicine strategies.
3.  **High-Confidence Therapeutic Targets and Biomarkers:** Our project will generate concrete, actionable lists of novel therapeutic targets. The identified core metabolic dependencies will represent high-priority targets for pan-cancer drug development. The context-specific vulnerabilities will provide a roadmap for personalized medicine, suggesting which patients might benefit from targeting a particular metabolic pathway based on their tumor's genetic makeup or tissue of origin. Furthermore, the metabolic signatures correlated with clinical outcomes will serve as novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers, with the potential for future clinical translation.

**Broader Impacts and Alignment with NCEMS Goals:**
This project is perfectly aligned with the mission of the NCEMS research call. It is a community-scale synthesis project that exclusively uses publicly available data to address a fundamental question in cellular biosciences. The project's success hinges on the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team, bringing together expertise that would not be found in a single lab. 
*   **Training the Next Generation:** A core component of our plan is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will be deeply embedded in this collaborative environment, gaining hands-on experience in large-scale data analysis, bioinformatics pipeline development, systems modeling, and machine learning. They will participate in regular working group meetings, workshops, and collaborative coding sessions, developing the cross-disciplinary skills essential for the future data-savvy workforce.
*   **Promoting Open Science:** We are fully committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science. All computational pipelines and analysis scripts will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub. All generated data, metabolic models, and results will be deposited in public repositories and shared through our project web portal under permissive licenses, adhering to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
Our dissemination strategy is designed for maximum impact. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. We will present our work at major international conferences, such as the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB). We will also organize workshops to train the broader research community on how to use the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas and our computational tools. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to become a living resource, continuously updated as new public datasets (e.g., from single-cell omics studies) become available. It will serve as a hypothesis-generating engine, sparking new avenues of experimental research and fostering collaborations between computational modelers, cancer biologists, and clinicians to validate our findings and translate them into improved patient care.

Budget And Resources

The integration of massive datasets from disparate sources, the development of a sophisticated multi-omic analysis pipeline, and the required synergy between experts in cancer biology, metabolism, and computational science make this project a perfect exemplar of a community-scale initiative.",,
ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_06,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,A Cross-Species Synthesis of Host-Virus Interactomes to Identify Conserved Antiviral Defenses and Viral Evasion Strategies,"The constant battle between viruses and their hosts has driven the evolution of sophisticated molecular arms races. Understanding the general principles of these conflicts is crucial for predicting and combating emerging viral threats. This project will synthesize all publicly available data on host-virus interactions to build a unified, cross-species map of this evolutionary battlefield. A collaborative team of virologists, immunologists, evolutionary biologists, and network scientists will integrate: 1) Host-virus protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from numerous studies and organisms; 2) Transcriptomic data (e.g., from GEO) detailing the host cellular response to infection across a wide range of viruses; and 3) Protein structural data to analyze the physical interfaces of host-virus interactions. By analyzing this integrated network, we will: a) Identify 'host defense hubs'—cellular proteins that are frequently targeted by diverse viruses, highlighting their central role in innate immunity; b) Uncover conserved viral strategies for manipulating these hubs; and c) Use signatures of rapid evolution (antagonistic co-evolution) in both host and viral proteins to pinpoint the high-conflict interfaces. This synthesis will reveal the fundamental rules of engagement in host-virus conflicts, creating a framework for predicting which cellular pathways a novel virus is likely to target and informing the design of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.",,"Background And Significance

The dynamic interplay between viruses and their hosts represents a powerful engine of molecular evolution, shaping the genomes and proteomes of both entities in a perpetual 'arms race'. Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, must commandeer host cellular machinery for their replication while simultaneously evading sophisticated host immune defenses. In response, hosts evolve diverse antiviral mechanisms to detect and neutralize viral threats. Understanding the fundamental principles governing these molecular conflicts is one of the most pressing challenges in modern biology, with profound implications for public health, particularly in an era of increasing pandemic risk. The recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a stark reminder of our vulnerability to emerging viral pathogens and underscored the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies that are effective against entire viral families or novel threats.

The current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data generated from reductionist, single-system studies. Over the past two decades, high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), and proximity-labeling techniques (e.g., BioID) have enabled the mapping of host-virus protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for numerous individual viruses, including influenza, HIV, dengue, and coronaviruses. These efforts have produced invaluable parts lists, identifying hundreds of host factors that physically associate with viral proteins. Concurrently, transcriptomic profiling (RNA-seq, microarrays) has provided a global view of the host cellular response to infection, revealing stereotyped responses like the activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) as well as virus-specific transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, the field of paleovirology, pioneered by researchers like Harmit Malik and Michael Emerman, has demonstrated how signatures of positive selection (antagonistic co-evolution) in host genes can be used to uncover ancient and ongoing host-virus conflicts.

Despite this explosion of data, a major limitation persists: the data remains highly fragmented and siloed. Interaction maps are typically generated for a single virus in a single host cell type, and data resides in disparate databases (e.g., BioGRID, IntAct, VirusMentha) and hundreds of individual publications. This fragmentation prevents the scientific community from discerning the general principles that transcend specific host-virus pairs. Key questions remain unanswered: Are there universal 'host defense hubs' that are convergently targeted by many different viruses? Do unrelated viruses evolve common strategies to subvert these hubs? Can we identify the precise molecular interfaces under the strongest evolutionary pressure? Answering these questions requires a large-scale data synthesis approach that integrates PPIs, transcriptomics, protein structures, and evolutionary data across a wide phylogenetic range of viruses and hosts. Such an endeavor is beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory, demanding a collaborative, transdisciplinary effort that combines expertise in virology, immunology, computational network biology, and evolutionary genetics. This project is therefore perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission to catalyze community-scale synthesis projects that address fundamental questions by integrating publicly available data. By unifying this fragmented knowledge, we can move from a descriptive, virus-by-virus understanding to a predictive framework of host-virus interactions, which is critical for developing next-generation antiviral therapies and preparing for future viral outbreaks.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research proposal is structured around three primary aims, each designed to address a fundamental question about the conserved nature of host-virus conflicts. By systematically integrating diverse public datasets, we will test a series of specific, interconnected hypotheses that, taken together, will build a comprehensive model of the molecular arms race.

**Aim 1: Identify Conserved Host Defense Hubs through Integrated Network Analysis.** This aim seeks to define the core cellular machinery that constitutes the front lines of antiviral defense.
*   **Research Question 1:** Are there specific host proteins or cellular pathways that are disproportionately and convergently targeted by a wide range of evolutionarily diverse viruses across different host species?
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** We hypothesize that a discrete set of host proteins, which we term 'host defense hubs,' function as central nodes in intrinsic and innate immunity and are therefore repeatedly targeted by unrelated viruses as a common strategy to disable host defenses. These hubs are not merely abundant or 'sticky' proteins but are functionally critical for antiviral responses.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** We predict that these hubs will be significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways related to immunity and viral lifecycle interference, such as ubiquitination, RNA processing, nuclear transport, and interferon signaling. Furthermore, we predict they will exhibit high centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness) within the integrated host-virus interactome.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will construct a comprehensive host-virus interaction network and employ permutation-based statistical tests to identify host proteins with a significantly greater number of unique viral family interactors than expected by chance. The functional importance of identified hubs will be validated by cross-referencing our list with orthogonal data from published genome-wide CRISPR screens that identify host dependency and restriction factors. Hubs that are both frequently targeted and identified as critical in functional screens will be considered high-confidence candidates.

**Aim 2: Uncover Conserved Viral Evasion Strategies by Analyzing Viral Protein Targeting Patterns.** This aim focuses on the viral side of the conflict, seeking to identify a 'playbook' of common viral tactics.
*   **Research Question 2:** Do phylogenetically distinct viruses evolve functionally analogous proteins that engage the same host hubs or pathways to achieve similar outcomes, such as immune evasion or replication support?
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** We hypothesize that viral proteins can be clustered into functional 'orthogroups' based on their shared host interaction profiles, even when they lack detectable sequence or structural homology. These clusters will represent convergent evolutionary solutions to common problems faced by all viruses.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** We predict that for a given host hub, the physical binding interfaces for proteins from different viruses will frequently overlap or be allosterically coupled, indicating that viral evolution is constrained to target specific functional sites on the host protein.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will use community detection algorithms on a bipartite network of viral proteins and their host targets to identify clusters of viral proteins with similar interaction 'fingerprints'. The biological relevance of these clusters will be assessed by analyzing the functions of their common host targets. For hubs with available structural data (from PDB or AlphaFold), we will perform structural alignments of their complexes with different viral proteins to statistically test for significant overlap in their binding interfaces.

**Aim 3: Pinpoint High-Conflict Interfaces using Signatures of Antagonistic Co-evolution.** This aim will add an evolutionary dimension to our static interaction map, highlighting the most dynamic and contested molecular interfaces.
*   **Research Question 3:** Can the integration of evolutionary rate analysis with interaction data pinpoint the specific amino acid residues at the heart of the host-virus arms race?
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** We hypothesize that host defense hubs and their direct viral protein interactors will exhibit significantly elevated rates of positive selection (dN/dS > 1) compared to the rest of the proteome, reflecting recurrent adaptation and counter-adaptation.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** We predict that the specific codons identified as being under positive selection in a host hub will be non-randomly distributed and will map disproportionately to the structurally-defined interaction interface with its viral antagonist.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will compile alignments of orthologous sequences for high-confidence interacting pairs. Using phylogenetic software like PAML and HyPhy, we will calculate dN/dS ratios and identify sites under positive selection. We will then map these sites onto protein structures and use a robust statistical test (e.g., a 3D clustering algorithm) to determine if these 'evolutionary hotspots' are significantly co-localized with the physical interaction interface.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a transdisciplinary Working Group composed of three Principal Investigators and their trainees, bringing together expertise in virology, network biology, and evolutionary genetics. The project is organized into three phases: Data Acquisition and Integration, Multi-modal Analysis, and Dissemination. This structure ensures a logical progression from data foundation to knowledge generation, directly addressing the research call's emphasis on synthesis, collaboration, and open science.

**Working Group Composition and Roles:**
*   **PI 1 (Virology & Immunology):** Dr. Jane Smith (University of Virology). Expertise in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. Role: Guide biological interpretation, curate virus-specific datasets, and lead manuscript preparation.
*   **PI 2 (Computational & Network Biology):** Dr. John Doe (Institute for Systems Biology). Expertise in bioinformatics, data integration, and network analysis. Role: Lead the development of the integrated database, perform all network analyses (Aim 1 & 2), and manage the project's computational infrastructure.
*   **PI 3 (Evolutionary Genetics):** Dr. Emily Stone (State University, Dept. of Genetics). Expertise in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. Role: Lead all evolutionary analyses (Aim 3), including sequence acquisition and positive selection modeling.
*   **Trainees (2 Postdocs, 2 Graduate Students):** Trainees will be central to the project's execution, providing dedicated effort for data curation, analysis, and tool development. They will benefit from co-mentorship by all PIs, participate in all group meetings, and receive cross-disciplinary training, fulfilling the NCEMS goal of training a data-savvy workforce.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Integration (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase focuses on building the comprehensive, multi-layered dataset that will power our analyses.
1.  **Data Sources:** We will systematically gather data from a wide array of public repositories. 
    *   **Host-Virus PPIs:** We will query BioGRID, IntAct, HPIDB, VirusMentha, and P-HIPSTer. This will be supplemented by text mining of the full-text biomedical literature using natural language processing (NLP) tools to capture newly published or un-curated interactions.
    *   **Host Transcriptomics:** We will download and uniformly process raw RNA-seq and microarray data from GEO and ArrayExpress for hundreds of studies involving viral infection of mammalian cells. A standardized pipeline (e.g., using Kallisto for RNA-seq) will be used to generate comparable differential expression profiles.
    *   **Protein Structures:** We will retrieve experimental structures from the PDB and leverage the comprehensive, high-quality predicted structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database for both host and viral proteins.
    *   **Orthologous Sequences:** We will obtain protein-coding sequences and pre-computed orthology groups from databases like OrthoDB, Ensembl, and NCBI RefSeq.
2.  **Data Integration Framework:** A key innovation of this project is the creation of a unified data model. All entities (proteins, genes, viruses, interactions) will be mapped to stable identifiers (e.g., UniProt, Ensembl, NCBI TaxID). We will develop a confidence scoring system for PPIs based on the number of independent experimental methods and publications supporting them. All curated and processed data will be loaded into a Neo4j graph database, which is optimized for storing and querying complex network relationships.

**Phase 2: Multi-modal Network and Evolutionary Analysis (Months 10-24)**
1.  **Aim 1 Analysis (Months 10-15):** We will construct the integrated host-virus interactome. To identify 'host defense hubs', we will calculate a 'viral convergence score' for each host protein, defined as the number of distinct viral families it interacts with. Statistical significance will be assessed using a permutation test that controls for protein length, expression level, and overall interaction degree (to avoid known biases). The resulting list of hubs will be functionally annotated using enrichment analysis (g:Profiler) and cross-validated against CRISPR screen data (from sources like Project Achilles).
2.  **Aim 2 Analysis (Months 16-20):** We will construct a bipartite graph of viral proteins and their host targets. We will apply the Louvain community detection algorithm to this network to identify modules of viral proteins that share similar host interaction profiles. For structurally characterized hubs, we will use tools like ProBis and ChimeraX to predict and compare binding interfaces for different viral partners, quantifying spatial overlap to test for convergent targeting of specific functional sites.
3.  **Aim 3 Analysis (Months 16-24):** For high-confidence interacting pairs identified in Aim 1, we will create multiple sequence alignments of orthologs. We will use the codeml program in the PAML package to fit codon-based models of evolution and perform likelihood ratio tests to detect positive selection along specific lineages. To identify individual sites, we will use empirical Bayes methods (in PAML) and complementary approaches like MEME (in HyPhy). The spatial coordinates of positively selected sites will be mapped onto protein structures, and we will use a custom Python script to test for their statistical enrichment at the PPI interface compared to the rest of the protein surface.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and database construction (M9). First version of the integrated network and preliminary identification of host defense hubs (M12). First annual in-person Working Group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Complete viral strategy clustering and structural interface analysis (M18). Complete evolutionary analysis for the top 100 candidate interacting pairs (M24). Submit database/resource manuscript. Second annual meeting.
*   **Year 3:** Finalize all analyses and interpretation. Submit manuscripts for Aims 2 and 3. Launch public web portal for data exploration. Final meeting to plan follow-on proposals and ensure long-term sustainability of the resource.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce a transformative shift in our understanding of host-virus interactions, moving from a collection of individual case studies to a unified, predictive framework. The expected outcomes will have a profound and lasting impact on molecular and cellular biosciences, with direct applications in public health and pandemic preparedness.

**Expected Outcomes and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Centralized, Integrated Community Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the Cross-Species Host-Virus Interactome (CS-HVI), a publicly accessible database and web portal. This resource will be the first of its kind to integrate PPI, transcriptomic, structural, and evolutionary data across hundreds of viruses and multiple host species. By breaking down existing data silos, the CS-HVI will serve as a foundational resource for the virology, immunology, and systems biology communities, enabling countless new hypotheses to be generated and tested by researchers worldwide. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be made available under open-source licenses, adhering to the highest standards of reproducible science as mandated by the NCEMS call.
2.  **A Data-Driven Catalog of Core Antiviral Machinery:** Our analysis will produce a high-confidence, ranked list of 'host defense hubs'—the key proteins and pathways that form the central battleground of host-virus conflicts. This provides a host-centric 'vulnerability map' of the cell, highlighting the machinery that is most critical for antiviral defense and therefore most frequently targeted by viruses. This will fundamentally reorient research priorities toward understanding these core cellular defense systems.
3.  **A Novel Functional Classification of Viral Proteins:** By clustering viral proteins based on their host-targeting patterns, we will create a new functional taxonomy that is independent of viral sequence homology. This will reveal convergent evolutionary strategies employed by disparate viruses to solve common problems, such as evading interferon signaling or hijacking the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This functional map will be invaluable for predicting the roles of uncharacterized proteins from newly discovered viruses.
4.  **High-Resolution Maps of Molecular Arms Races:** The integration of evolutionary analysis will pinpoint the specific amino acid residues at host-virus interfaces that are under intense selective pressure. This provides direct, dynamic evidence of molecular conflict and validates the functional importance of these interactions, moving beyond the static picture provided by PPI data alone.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Informing Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Development:** Host-directed therapies represent a promising strategy for combating viral diseases, as they are thought to be less susceptible to the evolution of viral resistance. Our catalog of host defense hubs provides a rationalized list of high-value targets for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that could be effective against entire families of viruses or even novel pathogens.
*   **Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness:** The framework developed in this project can be used to rapidly generate hypotheses about the mechanisms of a novel emerging virus. Upon sequencing the genome of a 'Virus X', its proteins can be structurally modeled and compared to the functional clusters in our CS-HVI database to predict which host pathways it is likely to manipulate. This can accelerate the scientific response, guiding experimental work and the search for therapeutic interventions.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. The four trainees will become experts in a rare combination of virology, computational biology, and evolutionary genetics. They will gain hands-on experience in large-scale data management, network analysis, collaborative science, and open research practices, preparing them to be leaders in the data-intensive biosciences of the future.

**Dissemination Plan:** We will pursue a multi-pronged dissemination strategy. We anticipate at least three high-impact publications in journals like Cell, Nature, or Science. Findings will be presented at key international conferences (e.g., ASV, ISMB, SMBE). The most important dissemination tool will be the CS-HVI web portal, which will provide intuitive tools for data visualization, querying, and bulk download, ensuring the project's outputs are maximally useful to the global research community.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the scope of a single research lab or existing collaboration. It requires the dedicated, coordinated effort of a multidisciplinary team and significant computational resources that are not available through standard individual investigator awards. NCEMS support is therefore essential to provide the personnel, collaborative infrastructure, and computational power needed to integrate these vast and disparate public datasets and extract novel biological principles. The budget is requested for a three-year period and is designed to maximize the project's impact and ensure the successful training of next-generation scientists.

**Budget Justification:** The primary costs are for personnel who will perform the intensive work of data curation, analysis, and resource development.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_07,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,The Epigenetic Echo: Identifying Conserved Mechanisms of Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance Across Species,"The concept that an organism's experiences can induce epigenetic changes inherited by subsequent generations is a revolutionary, yet controversial, idea in biology. A key barrier to progress is the lack of a systematic, cross-species synthesis of the available evidence. This project will form a working group to perform the first large-scale meta-analysis of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI) by integrating public data from diverse model organisms. The team, with expertise in epigenetics, developmental biology, toxicology, and bioinformatics, will collate and re-analyze datasets from C. elegans, Drosophila, mice, and plants where parental generations were exposed to environmental stimuli (e.g., diet, stress, toxicants) and epigenetic changes were profiled in unexposed F2 or F3 descendants. We will integrate data on DNA methylation, histone modifications (ChIP-seq), and small RNA populations (sRNA-seq). The primary goal is to search for conserved epigenetic signatures and molecular pathways that mediate TGEI. By comparing results across different species, stimuli, and inherited phenotypes, we aim to identify universal principles, such as the potential role of specific small RNA pathways or histone marks in carrying epigenetic information through the germline. This project will bring clarity to a contentious field, establish a rigorous framework for future studies, and address the fundamental question of how environmental information can be encoded and transmitted across generations.",,"Background And Significance

The inheritance of acquired characteristics, a concept once dismissed as Lamarckian, has re-emerged as a frontier in modern biology under the framework of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI). TGEI posits that environmental exposures can induce molecular changes to the epigenome that are not only stable within an organism's lifetime but can also be transmitted through the germline to subsequent, unexposed generations. This phenomenon fundamentally challenges the Modern Synthesis of evolutionary theory, which holds that inheritance is mediated almost exclusively through the DNA sequence. The significance of TGEI lies in its potential to act as a mechanism for rapid adaptation and its profound implications for human health, suggesting that parental life experiences, such as diet, stress, or toxicant exposure, could influence disease susceptibility in their descendants.

The field of TGEI is rich with compelling, yet often isolated, examples across diverse taxa. In the nematode *C. elegans*, starvation in the F0 generation has been shown to induce heritable changes in small RNA expression that regulate gene expression and influence longevity for at least three generations. Similarly, viral infection can trigger an inherited RNA interference (RNAi) response that confers protection to progeny. In *Drosophila*, heat stress has been linked to heritable chromatin state alterations that affect eye color. Seminal work in mammals, though controversial, has suggested that F0 exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin can cause reproductive defects in F3 generation males, correlated with altered DNA methylation in sperm. More recent studies on paternal stress or diet in mice have demonstrated effects on offspring metabolism and behavior, linked to changes in sperm small RNAs. In plants like *Arabidopsis thaliana*, which exhibit less extensive germline epigenetic reprogramming, stress-induced DNA methylation patterns can be stably inherited for multiple generations.

Despite these tantalizing findings, the field faces significant challenges that have prevented the formation of a unified theory of TGEI. A primary limitation is the fragmentation of research efforts. Studies are typically confined to a single model organism, a specific environmental stimulus, and a particular epigenetic mark. This siloed approach makes it impossible to discern whether observed phenomena represent species-specific curiosities or manifestations of a deeply conserved biological principle. Furthermore, methodological inconsistencies abound, including varying definitions of 'transgenerational' (e.g., F2 vs. F3 analysis, which is critical for excluding direct gamete exposure in mammals), different data analysis techniques, and a lack of standardized reporting. This has led to conflicting results and a persistent skepticism about the prevalence and mechanistic basis of TGEI, particularly in mammals where two major waves of epigenetic reprogramming in the germline and early embryo are thought to erase most epigenetic marks.

This research is both important and timely because we are at a critical inflection point. The explosion of publicly available epigenomic and transcriptomic data from numerous TGEI studies, housed in repositories like GEO and SRA, provides an unprecedented opportunity for a large-scale synthesis. For the first time, it is feasible to systematically collate, re-analyze, and integrate these disparate datasets to search for conserved patterns that are invisible at the level of individual studies. By leveraging this wealth of existing data, our proposed working group can address the key gaps in knowledge: Are there universal epigenetic carriers of inherited information? Are certain genomic regions evolutionarily predisposed to heritable epigenetic modification? Do different environmental stimuli converge on common molecular pathways across species? Answering these questions through a rigorous, cross-species meta-analysis will bring clarity to a contentious field, establish a robust framework for future research, and illuminate a fundamental mechanism by which the environment can leave a lasting echo across generations.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The central goal of this project is to move beyond anecdotal evidence and establish a quantitative, cross-species understanding of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Our research is guided by the overarching question: Are there conserved molecular signatures and mechanistic pathways of TGEI across divergent eukaryotic lineages? To address this, we have formulated four specific, interrelated research questions (RQs) that will structure our investigation.

**RQ1: The Nature of the Heritable Epigenetic Mark.** What are the commonalities and differences in the types of epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications, small non-coding RNAs) that are stably transmitted to F2/F3 generations following parental environmental exposure across *C. elegans*, *Drosophila*, *M. musculus*, and *A. thaliana*? While each of these marks has been implicated in TGEI in specific contexts, it is unknown if one modality serves as a primary, conserved information carrier, or if different species utilize distinct mechanisms.

**RQ2: The Genomic Context of Heritable Epigenetic Change.** Do specific classes of genes or genomic regions consistently serve as targets for heritable epigenetic modifications across species? We will investigate whether loci such as transposable elements (TEs), pericentromeric heterochromatin, developmental regulatory genes, or genes involved in metabolic pathways are disproportionately affected by TGEI, suggesting an inherent susceptibility or functional importance.

**RQ3: The Conservation of TGEI Pathways.** Can we identify conserved molecular pathways that are enriched for genes showing heritable epigenetic alterations? Identifying such pathways would provide strong evidence for a common mechanistic basis for TGEI and point to the core cellular machinery involved in writing, maintaining, and reading heritable epigenetic information across generations.

**RQ4: The Influence of Germline Biology on TGEI Fidelity.** How does the extent of germline epigenetic reprogramming influence the stability and scope of TGEI? By comparing species with extensive reprogramming (mice) against those with less complete erasure (invertebrates, plants), we can assess whether this process acts as a differential filter, allowing only certain types of epigenetic information to pass to the next generation.

To systematically address these questions, we will test three primary, falsifiable hypotheses:

**Hypothesis 1 (The Conserved Carrier Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) are a deeply conserved carrier of epigenetic information through the germline. We predict that a cross-species meta-analysis of sRNA-seq data from F2/F3 descendants will reveal specific classes of sncRNAs (e.g., piRNAs, endo-siRNAs) that are consistently and significantly altered following parental exposure. Furthermore, we predict that the predicted gene targets of these heritable sncRNAs will themselves show concordant changes in expression or epigenetic state (e.g., increased H3K27me3) and that the enzymatic machinery of these RNA pathways (e.g., Argonaute family proteins) will emerge as a conserved hub in our network analysis.

**Hypothesis 2 (The Genomic Loci Susceptibility Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that transposable elements and other repetitive DNA are evolutionarily conserved hotspots for the establishment of heritable epigenetic states. We predict that across all four species, genomic regions exhibiting heritable changes in repressive marks (e.g., DNA methylation, H3K9me3) will be significantly enriched for TEs compared to the genomic background. We will validate this by testing whether the distance to the nearest TE is a significant predictor of a gene's likelihood of undergoing a heritable epigenetic change.

**Hypothesis 3 (The Stimulus-Response Convergence Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that while the specific genes affected by TGEI are stimulus-dependent, these responses converge on conserved biological pathways across species. We predict that parental exposure to metabolic stressors (e.g., high-fat diet, starvation) will lead to heritable epigenetic changes in orthologous genes within conserved metabolic pathways (e.g., insulin/IGF-1 signaling, TOR signaling) in descendants across mice, flies, and worms. Similarly, we predict that toxicant exposures will heritably alter genes in conserved detoxification and stress-response pathways (e.g., cytochrome P450s, heat shock proteins). Testing this requires a multi-level analysis integrating stimulus classification with cross-species pathway enrichment analysis.

Methods And Approach

This project is designed as a community-scale synthesis effort, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group in epigenetics, developmental biology, and computational biology to integrate publicly available data. Our approach is organized into three sequential phases, underpinned by a commitment to open and reproducible science.

**Phase 1: Systematic Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-6)**
Our first objective is to build a comprehensive, curated database of TGEI studies. We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), for relevant datasets.
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** A study will be included if it meets the following criteria: (1) involves a defined environmental exposure in the P0/F0 generation in *C. elegans*, *D. melanogaster*, *M. musculus*, or *A. thaliana*; (2) includes molecular profiling of an unexposed F2 or later generation (F3 for mammals to rigorously exclude direct germline exposure); (3) provides publicly available raw sequencing data for at least one relevant modality (e.g., BS-seq, ChIP-seq, sRNA-seq, RNA-seq); and (4) includes a concurrently maintained, unexposed control lineage.
*   **Metadata Schema:** For each included study, we will extract and standardize a rich set of metadata, including species, strain, stimulus type, dose, duration, sex of exposed parent, tissue type, and sequencing technology. This curated metadata will be essential for subsequent stratified analyses and will be made publicly available.

**Phase 2: Standardized Multi-Omic Re-analysis Pipelines (Months 4-15)**
A critical flaw in previous narrative reviews is the comparison of results generated with different bioinformatics methods. To overcome this, we will re-process all raw sequencing data from scratch using a suite of standardized, state-of-the-art analysis pipelines.
*   **Reproducible Workflows:** We will develop and implement a series of containerized (Docker/Singularity) workflows using Nextflow, a portable and scalable workflow manager. This ensures absolute reproducibility and allows for efficient deployment on both local high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and cloud infrastructure. Separate pipelines will be optimized for each data type:
    *   **BS-seq/WGBS:** Quality control (FastQC/TrimGalore), alignment and methylation calling (Bismark), and identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using a consistent statistical model (e.g., methylKit).
    *   **ChIP-seq:** QC, alignment (BWA-MEM), peak calling (MACS2), and differential binding analysis (DiffBind) to identify regions with significant changes in histone modifications.
    *   **sRNA-seq:** QC, adapter trimming, alignment to the genome and RNA databases (miRBase, piRNAdb), quantification of known and novel small RNAs, and differential expression analysis (DESeq2).
    *   **RNA-seq:** QC, alignment (STAR), gene/transcript quantification (RSEM), and differential expression analysis (DESeq2).
*   **Open Source Commitment:** All analysis pipelines, scripts, and associated documentation will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub from the project's inception.

**Phase 3: Cross-Species Integrative Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Months 12-24)**
This phase represents the core synthesis effort, where we will integrate the harmonized analysis results to test our hypotheses.
*   **Orthology Mapping:** To enable direct cross-species comparisons, we will map genes between the four species using the OrthoDB database, focusing on one-to-one orthologs to ensure high confidence.
*   **Testing H1 (Conserved Carrier):** We will search for conserved classes of sncRNAs that are differentially expressed in F2/F3 generations across species. We will then use target prediction algorithms (e.g., TargetScan, miRanda) to determine if these heritable sncRNAs are predicted to regulate orthologous genes that also show heritable changes in expression or chromatin state, thereby linking the carrier to its putative target.
*   **Testing H2 (Genomic Loci):** Using TE annotations from RepeatMasker, we will perform permutation-based enrichment tests to determine if DMRs or differential ChIP-seq peaks are significantly co-localized with specific TE families. This analysis will be performed for each species and then compared across species to identify conserved associations.
*   **Testing H3 (Stimulus-Response):** We will classify all experimental stimuli into broad categories ('Metabolic', 'Toxicant', 'Psychological Stress', etc.). For each category, we will perform Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses on the sets of orthologous genes showing heritable changes. A significant overlap in enriched pathways across species for a given stimulus category would support our hypothesis.
*   **Network-Based Integration:** We will construct multi-layered networks where nodes are orthologous genes and edges represent different types of evidence for TGEI (e.g., differential expression, differential methylation). We will use network analysis algorithms to identify conserved modules and hub genes that represent the core machinery of TGEI.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data curation and metadata database (M6); Deployment of all analysis pipelines and completion of pilot re-analyses (M9); Completion of all single-species re-analyses (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Completion of cross-species orthology mapping and initial integrative analyses (M18); Final hypothesis testing, network analysis, and manuscript drafting (M21); Public launch of data portal and submission of primary manuscript (M24).
*   **Collaboration:** The working group will meet in person twice annually, supplemented by monthly video conferences to ensure tight integration, troubleshoot challenges, and provide training opportunities for junior members.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to the field of epigenetics and our broader understanding of inheritance. The expected outcomes are designed to provide not only novel scientific insights but also lasting resources for the entire research community, directly aligning with the NCEMS mission to catalyze synthesis in the molecular and cellular biosciences.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary outcome will be the first-ever systematic, quantitative synthesis of the molecular evidence for TGEI across major eukaryotic model organisms. This will elevate the field from a collection of disparate observations to a data-driven science. We will produce a definitive, cross-species catalog of the genes, pathways, and genomic regions that are hotspots for heritable epigenetic change. By identifying conserved molecular signatures—such as specific small RNA pathways or histone modifications on transposable elements—we will provide a robust, mechanistic framework for TGEI. This will resolve long-standing debates about the existence and nature of epigenetic inheritance and provide a concrete foundation for future, hypothesis-driven experimental work. Furthermore, our development and dissemination of standardized, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines will establish a new gold standard for rigor in the field, enhancing the reliability of future studies.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The implications of this research extend far beyond basic science. In **public health**, understanding the mechanisms of TGEI is critical for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm. Our findings could reveal how parental exposures to environmental factors like malnutrition, pollution, and stress are molecularly encoded and transmitted, potentially influencing offspring risk for chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders. This knowledge could inform novel public health interventions and preventative strategies aimed at breaking intergenerational cycles of disease. In **toxicology and environmental risk assessment**, our work could provide the scientific basis for incorporating transgenerational effects into regulatory frameworks for chemical safety, which currently do not consider heritable impacts beyond direct DNA mutation. In **evolutionary biology**, this project will provide crucial evidence for a non-genetic mode of inheritance that could facilitate rapid adaptation to changing environments, a topic of intense interest in the context of global climate change.

**Dissemination, Data Sharing, and Open Science:**
We are deeply committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science. All analysis pipelines and code will be shared via a public GitHub repository. The central deliverable of this project, beyond publications, will be the creation of a **TGEI Synthesis Data Portal**. This publicly accessible web resource will serve as a lasting legacy, providing the community with:
1.  A searchable, curated database of TGEI studies and their experimental metadata.
2.  Access to all harmonized, re-analyzed data, including differential expression/methylation lists and browser tracks.
3.  Interactive visualization tools to explore conserved genes, pathways, and epigenetic signatures across species and stimuli.
Our findings will be disseminated through high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at major international conferences (e.g., Gordon Research Conference on Epigenetics, CSHL Meetings), and a final project workshop aimed at training the broader community on our methods and data portal.

**Training and Collaboration:**
This working group is an ideal environment for training the next generation of data-savvy biologists. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the project, gaining invaluable cross-disciplinary experience in computational biology, data integration, and collaborative team science. They will lead sub-projects, co-author papers, and present their work, preparing them for leadership roles in modern, data-intensive biological research. The collaborative structure of the working group, bringing together experts from different institutions, career stages, and scientific backgrounds, is essential for the project's success and embodies the spirit of the NCEMS research call.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory and requires the dedicated, coordinated effort of a multidisciplinary team. The need to collate, curate, and uniformly re-analyze hundreds of complex sequencing datasets from four different species necessitates a level of focused personnel time and computational infrastructure that cannot be supported by traditional R01-type funding mechanisms. This project is fundamentally about integration and synthesis, making it an ideal fit for the NCEMS Working Group program. The budget is designed to support the personnel, collaborative activities, and computational resources essential for achieving our ambitious goals over a two-year period.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_08,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,"A Multi-Scale Atlas of Cellular Senescence Integrating Molecular, Imaging, and Spatial Omics Data","Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest, is a complex emergent phenotype implicated in aging and numerous diseases. However, senescence is highly heterogeneous, and a unified understanding of its core features and context-dependent variations is missing. This project will create a comprehensive, multi-scale 'Senescence Atlas' by synthesizing diverse public data types. A working group of gerontologists, cell biologists, computer vision experts, and computational biologists will integrate: 1) Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data (e.g., from Tabula Muris Senis, ENCODE) to define molecular subtypes of senescent cells; 2) Proteomic data to characterize the composition of the pro-inflammatory Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP); 3) High-resolution imaging data from resources like the Image Data Resource and Cell Image Library to build machine learning models that can identify senescent cells based on their unique morphology; and 4) Emerging spatial transcriptomics datasets to map the interactions between senescent cells and their tissue microenvironments. By integrating these disparate scales of information—from chromatin state to tissue architecture—we will develop a holistic model of senescence. This atlas will serve as a central resource for the aging research community, enabling the identification of robust biomarkers and the development of more precise senolytic therapies.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, is a fundamental biological process with a paradoxical role in health and disease. Initially described as a limit to cellular proliferation in vitro, it is now recognized as a critical tumor suppression mechanism and an essential component of tissue repair and embryonic development. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age is also a major driver of organismal aging and a contributor to a wide range of age-related pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. This dual functionality highlights the complexity and context-dependency of the senescent phenotype, an emergent property arising from intricate molecular networks. The canonical markers used to identify senescent cells—such as senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, expression of cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p21CIP1, and the formation of DNA damage foci—are often inconsistent and lack specificity. Furthermore, a key feature of many senescent cells is the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a complex secretome of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases that can profoundly alter the tissue microenvironment. The composition of the SASP is highly variable, depending on the cell type and the senescence-inducing stressor. This heterogeneity is the central challenge in the field. Recent large-scale data generation efforts have provided tantalizing glimpses into this complexity. Projects like the Tabula Muris Senis have generated single-cell transcriptomic data across the lifespan of mice, revealing age-associated shifts in cell populations that are likely related to senescence. Similarly, proteomic studies have begun to catalog the diversity of the SASP, while high-content imaging screens have documented the profound morphological changes that accompany the senescent transition. However, these valuable datasets remain largely siloed. Transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging, and epigenomic data are typically analyzed in isolation, preventing a holistic understanding of the senescent state. We lack a systematic framework to connect a cell's gene expression program to its morphology, its secretome, and its spatial interactions within a tissue. This fragmentation of knowledge represents a major gap in the field. It prevents the identification of robust, universal biomarkers of senescence and hampers the rational design of senotherapeutics—drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells. The lack of an integrated model means we cannot reliably distinguish between potentially beneficial and pathogenic senescent cells, a critical distinction for therapeutic intervention. This research is both important and timely. With global populations aging rapidly, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging is a paramount public health challenge. Senolytics are already advancing into clinical trials, yet our incomplete understanding of senescence heterogeneity poses a significant risk, as indiscriminate removal of all senescent cells could have unintended negative consequences. The recent explosion in publicly available multi-omics and imaging data, coupled with advances in machine learning and data integration algorithms, creates an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge. A community-scale synthesis effort, as proposed here, is now feasible and necessary to unify these disparate data streams into a coherent model. This project directly addresses the emergent nature of senescence by integrating data across biological scales, a task beyond the scope of any single lab and perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to solve fundamental questions in biosciences.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to construct a multi-scale, integrated 'Senescence Atlas' that systematically defines the core principles and context-dependent heterogeneity of cellular senescence. This atlas will serve as a predictive model of the senescent state, linking molecular programs to cellular morphology and tissue-level function. To achieve this, our working group will address four fundamental research questions.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can we establish a comprehensive molecular taxonomy of senescent cell subtypes by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data across diverse tissues, species, and senescence inducers?**
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Senescent cells can be classified into a finite set of distinct, transcriptionally-defined subtypes that represent core functional programs (e.g., 'pro-inflammatory,' 'pro-fibrotic,' 'immunosuppressive'), and these subtypes are conserved across different biological contexts.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** These transcriptional subtypes are governed by specific and recurring patterns of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, which serve as a stable epigenetic memory of the senescent state.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will apply unsupervised clustering algorithms to integrated single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets from public repositories. Subtypes will be defined by robust marker genes and regulatory elements. We will validate the taxonomy by training a machine learning classifier on a subset of the data and testing its ability to accurately classify cells in independent datasets. The expected deliverable is a hierarchical classification of senescence subtypes with detailed molecular signatures.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): Can deep learning models trained on high-resolution imaging data accurately identify senescent cells and do their morphological phenotypes correlate with defined molecular subtypes?**
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to distinguish senescent from non-senescent cells with high accuracy (>90%) based solely on morphological features (e.g., cell size, nuclear shape, organelle texture) extracted from microscopy images.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The quantitative morphological features learned by the CNN will correlate significantly with the molecular subtypes defined in RQ1, establishing a direct link between gene expression programs and the physical phenotype of the cell.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will curate and annotate a large image dataset of senescent and control cells from the Image Data Resource and other public sources. A CNN will be trained and rigorously validated using cross-validation. To test H2b, we will identify datasets with paired imaging and transcriptomic data, allowing us to directly correlate the model's morphological classifications with molecular profiles using statistical methods. The deliverable is a validated, open-source image analysis pipeline for senescence detection.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How does the composition of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) vary across molecular subtypes, and what are the core regulatory networks controlling its expression?**
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The SASP is not a single entity but comprises distinct modules of secreted factors, and the expression of these modules is tightly coupled to specific molecular subtypes of senescent cells.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** By integrating proteomic data of the secretome with transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we can identify key transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, C/EBPβ) and signaling pathways that act as master regulators for different SASP modules.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate public proteomic datasets of senescent secretomes with our molecular subtype definitions. We will use weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-secreted proteins and correlate them with subtypes. We will perform transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis on the regulatory regions of SASP genes to validate regulatory hypotheses. The outcome will be a comprehensive map linking SASP composition to cell subtype and its underlying regulatory network.

**Research Question 4 (RQ4): How are senescent cell subtypes spatially organized within tissues, and how do they interact with their microenvironment to drive emergent phenotypes like chronic inflammation?**
*   **Hypothesis 4a:** The spatial distribution of senescent cells in tissues is non-random, with specific subtypes preferentially localizing to distinct tissue niches or in proximity to particular cell types (e.g., immune cells).
*   **Hypothesis 4b:** The identity and spatial arrangement of senescent subtypes and their neighbors can predict the local tissue state (e.g., inflammation, fibrosis, immune surveillance), revealing the rules of their collective behavior.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will leverage public spatial transcriptomics datasets. Using our molecular signatures from RQ1, we will deconvolve the identity and location of senescent subtypes. We will then apply spatial statistics to test for non-random co-localization patterns and use ligand-receptor interaction modeling to map potential signaling networks in situ. The deliverable will be a set of 'interaction maps' detailing the social context of different senescent subtypes.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in computational biology, gerontology, computer vision, and spatial omics. The collaborative structure, facilitated by NCEMS, is essential for integrating the diverse data types and analytical approaches required. Our approach is organized around a 3-year timeline with clear milestones and deliverables, all adhering to open science principles.

**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** The project will be co-led by four PIs from different institutions, ensuring a diversity of perspectives. The team will include two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students who will work across labs, fostering a deeply collaborative and interdisciplinary training environment. Collaboration will be managed through weekly virtual meetings, quarterly in-person workshops hosted by NCEMS, a shared Slack channel for daily communication, and a centralized GitHub organization for all code and analysis pipelines. This structure demonstrates a clear need for NCEMS support to facilitate a level of interaction beyond a standard multi-PI grant.

**Data Acquisition and Curation (Milestone 1: Months 1-6):** Our first major task is to build a comprehensive, curated database of publicly available senescence-related data. We will systematically mine repositories including NCBI GEO, SRA, ENCODE, ProteomeXchange, Image Data Resource (IDR), and the Human Cell Atlas. A standardized metadata schema will be developed to capture critical experimental variables (species, tissue, cell type, senescence inducer, protocol). Datasets will include:
*   **Transcriptomics:** Over 100 single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets from aged or diseased tissues (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis) and numerous bulk RNA-seq datasets from in vitro senescence models.
*   **Epigenomics:** Publicly available scATAC-seq, CUT&RUN, and ChIP-seq data for key histone marks (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K9me3) and DNA methylation arrays from well-characterized senescent systems.
*   **Proteomics:** Mass spectrometry datasets of conditioned media from senescent cells cataloged in ProteomeXchange and other repositories.
*   **Imaging:** High-content microscopy screens from IDR and other sources, featuring morphological and marker-based staining of senescent cells.
*   **Spatial Omics:** Public Visium, MIBI-TOF, and MERFISH datasets from tissues known to accumulate senescent cells, such as fibrotic lung and aged skin.
*   **Deliverable:** A public, searchable catalog of all curated datasets with standardized metadata.

**Analytical Plan:**
*   **Aim 1: Molecular Subtype Definition (Milestone 2: Months 7-18):** We will develop and apply a standardized computational pipeline for processing all transcriptomic and epigenomic data. Data integration will be performed using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Harmony, Seurat v4) to correct for batch effects. We will then use graph-based clustering (e.g., Leiden) on the integrated latent space to identify putative senescent subtypes. These subtypes will be characterized by identifying differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns. The robustness of the subtypes will be validated across datasets and species.
*   **Aim 2: Morphological Phenotyping (Milestone 3: Months 7-24):** Images will be preprocessed using a pipeline built with CellProfiler and Python libraries. We will employ a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) on our annotated image dataset to classify cells. The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated. We will use explainable AI techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) to identify the key morphological features driving classification. These features will then be statistically correlated with the molecular subtypes from Aim 1 using datasets where both data types are available.
*   **Aim 3: SASP Characterization (Milestone 4: Months 12-30):** Proteomic data will be re-analyzed through a uniform pipeline to ensure comparability. We will map secreted proteins to their genes and test for the enrichment of specific protein sets within our transcriptomic subtypes. Regulatory network inference tools (e.g., SCENIC) will be applied to the integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic data to identify transcription factors that regulate subtype-specific SASP modules.
*   **Aim 4: Spatial Analysis (Milestone 5: Months 18-36):** We will use our molecular subtype signatures as a reference to deconvolve the spatial locations of senescent cells in spatial transcriptomics data using tools like cell2location. Following deconvolution, we will apply a suite of spatial statistics tools (e.g., from the `squidpy` library) to analyze neighborhood compositions, cell-cell interactions, and niche organization. Ligand-receptor modeling will predict signaling pathways active between senescent cells and their microenvironment.

**Timeline and Open Science:**
*   **Year 1:** Data curation, pipeline development, initial molecular subtype definition, and image model training.
*   **Year 2:** Refinement of subtypes, integration with proteomics and imaging, and initial spatial analysis.
*   **Year 3:** Final multi-modal integration, construction of the interactive Senescence Atlas web portal, manuscript preparation, and community workshops.
All code will be developed openly on GitHub with version control. All processed data, analysis results, and trained models will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Model Zoo) with detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility and community reuse.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of aging biology, cell biology, and translational medicine. Its impact will be felt through the creation of a foundational public resource, the generation of novel biological insights, the development of new analytical tools, and the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **The Senescence Atlas:** The primary deliverable will be a first-of-its-kind, multi-scale 'Senescence Atlas,' delivered as an open-access, interactive web portal. This will not be a static repository but a dynamic knowledge base allowing researchers to explore the connections between genes, proteins, cell morphologies, and tissue locations across dozens of contexts. It will become an indispensable resource for the aging research community, analogous to resources like the Human Cell Atlas or the ENCODE portal.
2.  **A Data-Driven Taxonomy of Senescence:** We will replace the current ambiguous and qualitative descriptions of senescence with a robust, quantitative classification of senescent subtypes. This new taxonomy, based on the integration of thousands of data points, will provide a common language for the field, resolve long-standing controversies, and allow for the re-interpretation of previous studies in a new, more precise context.
3.  **Robust, Multi-Modal Biomarkers:** By identifying the core molecular and morphological features that are conserved across different senescent subtypes and contexts, this project will deliver a panel of validated, high-confidence biomarkers. This will overcome a major bottleneck in the field, enabling more reliable detection and quantification of senescent cells in both research and clinical settings.
4.  **A Novel Integrative Analytical Framework:** We will develop and disseminate a powerful, open-source computational workflow for synthesizing multi-modal biological data (genomics, proteomics, imaging, spatial-omics). This framework will be a valuable resource in itself, adaptable by other researchers to study different complex biological phenomena characterized by heterogeneity and emergent properties.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Senotherapeutics:** Our findings will have a direct and immediate impact on the development of drugs targeting senescent cells. By defining subtype-specific vulnerabilities and SASP profiles, the atlas will enable the design of next-generation, precision senolytics that can target pathogenic senescent cells while sparing those with beneficial functions. This will lead to more effective and safer therapies for a host of age-related diseases.
*   **Enhancing Diagnostics:** The machine learning models for image-based senescence detection have the potential to be translated into digital pathology tools. This could provide clinicians with a quantitative, automated method to assess senescent cell burden in patient biopsies, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of treatment response.
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is intrinsically designed to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interface of biology, data science, and machine learning. Through the NCEMS working group model, trainees will gain invaluable experience in large-scale data analysis, collaborative team science, and open-source software development, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-driven biomedical workforce.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
Our commitment to open science will ensure maximum impact. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. The Senescence Atlas web portal will be our primary means of dissemination to the research community. We will actively promote its use through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., GSA, ASCB, ISMB) and by hosting hands-on workshops to train users. The atlas is envisioned as a living resource, designed with a flexible architecture to incorporate new public datasets as they become available. We will seek follow-on funding to ensure its long-term maintenance and expansion, establishing a permanent, community-driven resource that will catalyze research and discovery in aging biology for many years to come.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_09,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,Decoding the Functional Grammar of the Non-Coding Transcriptome,"While thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed from the human genome, the functional roles of the vast majority remain enigmatic. This project proposes a large-scale computational synthesis to create a 'functional grammar' for lncRNAs, enabling the prediction of their biological roles. A multidisciplinary working group will integrate several key public datasets: 1) The comprehensive FANTOM and ENCODE compendia of lncRNA expression and chromatin states across cell types; 2) eCLIP and RIP-seq data identifying the proteins that bind to lncRNAs; 3) Chromatin interaction data (Hi-C, ChIA-PET) to link lncRNAs to their potential gene targets in 3D space; and 4) RNA secondary structure predictions and probing data. The team will develop a multi-layered network model where lncRNAs, proteins, and target genes are nodes connected by different types of functional evidence. By applying network propagation algorithms and machine learning, we will: a) Cluster lncRNAs into functional modules based on shared properties (e.g., binding proteins, subcellular localization, target pathways); b) Predict whether a lncRNA acts as a 'scaffold', 'guide', 'decoy', or 'enhancer'; and c) Generate high-confidence hypotheses for thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs. This will produce a foundational resource, the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' to guide experimental research into the non-coding genome.",,"Background And Significance

The central dogma of molecular biology has long focused on the flow of genetic information from DNA to protein. However, the completion of the human genome project and subsequent large-scale transcriptomic studies, such as those by the ENCODE and FANTOM consortia, revealed a surprising reality: the vast majority of the genome is pervasively transcribed, yet less than 2% codes for proteins. This discovery unveiled a massive, uncharted territory of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among the most abundant and enigmatic of these are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with no significant protein-coding potential. Tens of thousands of lncRNAs have been annotated, and their expression is often highly specific to cell type, developmental stage, and disease state, strongly implying functional relevance. Seminal studies on a few select lncRNAs have provided tantalizing glimpses into their diverse molecular roles. For instance, *XIST* orchestrates X-chromosome inactivation by coating the chromosome and recruiting silencing complexes. *HOTAIR* acts as a molecular scaffold, bridging polycomb repressive complexes to target gene loci to regulate chromatin state. *MALAT1* functions within nuclear speckles to modulate alternative splicing, while *GAS5* acts as a 'decoy' by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor to prevent its action on DNA. These examples establish four key mechanistic archetypes—guide, scaffold, decoy, and enhancer—demonstrating that lncRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression at multiple levels. Despite these advances, a monumental gap in our knowledge persists. Fewer than 1% of annotated human lncRNAs have been functionally characterized. This knowledge gap represents a major bottleneck in understanding genome function, cellular physiology, and the molecular basis of human disease. Current computational approaches to predict lncRNA function are often limited in scope. Many rely on a 'guilt-by-association' principle, inferring function from co-expression with protein-coding genes. Others focus on genomic context, such as proximity to known genes. While useful, these methods fail to integrate the rich, multi-modal data that describe the molecular life of a lncRNA—whom it binds, where it localizes, its 3D genomic context, and its structure. There is no systematic framework to synthesize these disparate data types to understand the underlying 'rules' or 'grammar' that govern lncRNA function. The research community lacks a comprehensive resource that provides high-confidence, mechanistically-grounded hypotheses for the thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs. This project is both important and timely because we are at a unique confluence of data availability and analytical capability. The explosion of publicly available datasets—including genome-wide maps of RNA-protein interactions (eCLIP), 3D chromatin architecture (Hi-C), and chromatin states—provides an unprecedented opportunity for data synthesis. This project proposes to seize this opportunity by assembling a multidisciplinary working group to integrate these datasets into a unified computational framework. By doing so, we will move beyond simple correlation to build a predictive model of lncRNA function. This work is critical for prioritizing experimental studies, uncovering novel biological pathways, and ultimately understanding the role of the non-coding genome in health and disease, directly addressing the core mission of this research call to solve fundamental puzzles in molecular biology through community-scale data synthesis.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that systematically deciphers the functional grammar of human lncRNAs by integrating multi-modal genomic and transcriptomic data. To achieve this, we will address three central research questions, each associated with specific, testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: Can lncRNAs be systematically classified into functional modules based on the integrated signatures of their molecular interactions, expression patterns, and genomic context?**
This question addresses the fundamental principle of biological organization, where molecules with related functions often operate in coordinated modules. We hypothesize that lncRNAs do not function in isolation but as part of larger ribonucleoprotein complexes and regulatory networks.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** LncRNAs that share similar sets of interacting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), exhibit correlated expression patterns with specific protein-coding genes, and share subcellular localizations will participate in common biological pathways or cellular processes.
*   **Prediction:** Our multi-layered network model, which integrates these data types, will reveal distinct, statistically significant clusters (modules) of lncRNAs, proteins, and genes. We predict that the protein-coding genes within a given module will show significant enrichment for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways, thereby imputing a putative function to the co-clustered, uncharacterized lncRNAs.
*   **Validation:** We will validate these module assignments by assessing their consistency with existing knowledge. We will test whether the few well-characterized lncRNAs within a module have functions consistent with the module's overall enrichment score. Furthermore, we will use external datasets, such as phenotype data from lncRNA knockdown screens, to check if perturbing lncRNAs from the same predicted module results in similar cellular phenotypes.

**Research Question 2: Can a predictive model be developed to classify the primary molecular mechanism of uncharacterized lncRNAs into established archetypes (scaffold, guide, decoy, enhancer)?**
This question moves from 'what' a lncRNA does (its biological process) to 'how' it does it (its molecular mechanism). We aim to define the quantitative features that distinguish different functional classes.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Different lncRNA functional archetypes possess distinct, quantifiable multi-omic features. For example, 'scaffold' lncRNAs will have a high degree of RBP binding complexity and specific structural motifs; 'guide' lncRNAs will show strong interactions with chromatin-modifying enzymes and co-localize with their genomic targets in 3D space; 'decoy' lncRNAs will bind specific proteins (like transcription factors) with high affinity but lack other features; and 'enhancer' lncRNAs will originate from regions with active enhancer chromatin marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) and physically loop to target gene promoters.
*   **Prediction:** A machine learning classifier trained on a feature set derived from our integrated network can accurately assign uncharacterized lncRNAs to one of these mechanistic classes.
*   **Validation:** We will curate a 'gold standard' training set of well-characterized lncRNAs with established mechanisms. The performance of our classifier will be rigorously evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, measuring metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall. The model's feature importance scores will reveal which data types are most informative for predicting each mechanism, providing insights into the functional grammar itself.

**Research Question 3: How can the cis- and trans-acting gene targets of lncRNAs be accurately predicted on a genome-wide scale?**
Identifying the downstream genes regulated by a lncRNA is crucial for understanding its ultimate biological impact.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The true regulatory targets of a lncRNA are identifiable through the convergence of multiple independent lines of evidence, including genomic proximity (for cis-acting lncRNAs), significant 3D chromatin looping interactions (from Hi-C/ChIA-PET), and robust expression correlation across diverse cellular contexts.
*   **Prediction:** A network propagation algorithm initiated from a specific lncRNA node in our multi-layered network will identify high-confidence protein-coding gene targets. We predict that these computationally-derived targets will be significantly enriched for genes whose expression changes following experimental perturbation of the source lncRNA, based on publicly available CRISPRi/knockdown screen data.
*   **Validation:** We will benchmark our predictions against curated databases of experimentally validated lncRNA-target interactions (e.g., LncTarD). We will also perform a systematic analysis using data from projects like DECODE, testing whether our predicted targets show the expected expression changes upon lncRNA depletion. This provides a large-scale, albeit indirect, validation of our approach.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed in three distinct but interconnected phases, leveraging a transdisciplinary approach to data integration, network modeling, and machine learning. Our methodology is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and fully aligned with open science principles.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Processing, and Harmonization (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase focuses on assembling and standardizing the diverse public datasets required for our synthesis. All data will be uniformly mapped to the hg38 human genome assembly and GENCODE v38 gene annotations to ensure consistency.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically download data from major public repositories including ENCODE, FANTOM, GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics, and the 4D Nucleome portal. Key datasets include: 
    1.  **LncRNA Expression & Annotation:** RNA-seq data from ENCODE and GTEx across hundreds of cell types and tissues; CAGE-seq data from FANTOM5/6 for precise transcription start site identification.
    2.  **RNA-Protein Interactions:** All available eCLIP datasets from ENCODE (~200 RBPs) will be reprocessed using a uniform peak-calling pipeline (e.g., CLIPper) to generate a consistent map of RBP binding sites on lncRNA transcripts.
    3.  **Chromatin State & Accessibility:** Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for key histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) and ATAC-seq/DNase-seq data will be used to define the chromatin context of lncRNA loci.
    4.  **3D Chromatin Architecture:** High-resolution in situ Hi-C data will be processed using tools like Juicer to identify significant chromatin loops. Where available, targeted interaction data (ChIA-PET, HiChIP) will be used to map promoter-centric interactions.
    5.  **Subcellular Localization:** RNA-seq data from cellular fractionation experiments (e.g., nuclear, cytoplasmic, chromatin-associated) from ENCODE will be used to determine the primary location of each lncRNA.
*   **Data Harmonization:** A critical step will be the development of a standardized computational pipeline to process each data type, control for technical variability, and generate analysis-ready data matrices and interaction lists. This pipeline will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub.

**Phase 2: Construction of the Multi-Layered LncRNA Network (Months 7-12)**
We will construct a heterogeneous graph, a powerful data structure for representing complex biological relationships. The network will consist of three types of nodes (lncRNAs, proteins/RBPs, protein-coding genes) and multiple types of edges, each representing a different layer of biological evidence.
*   **Network Layers (Edge Types):**
    1.  **LncRNA-Protein Binding:** Weighted edges based on eCLIP peak significance.
    2.  **LncRNA-Gene Co-expression:** Weighted edges representing significant expression correlation across tissues/cell lines.
    3.  **LncRNA-Gene Chromatin Interaction:** Edges connecting lncRNA promoters to gene promoters via significant Hi-C loops.
    4.  **LncRNA-Gene Genomic Adjacency:** Edges connecting lncRNAs to their nearest neighboring genes in cis.
    5.  **Protein-Protein Interaction:** Edges from the STRING database to provide context on RBP complexes.
*   **Implementation:** The network will be implemented in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to allow for efficient querying and complex pattern analysis. Each edge will be annotated with its source evidence and confidence score.

**Phase 3: Network Analysis, Prediction, and Hypothesis Generation (Months 13-30)**
This phase involves applying computational algorithms to the integrated network to address our core research questions.
*   **Aim 1 (Functional Module Discovery):** We will employ community detection algorithms, such as the Louvain method, on the integrated network. This will partition the network into modules of densely interconnected nodes. For each module, we will perform functional enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways) on its constituent proteins and genes to assign a putative biological function to the entire module, including its uncharacterized lncRNAs.
*   **Aim 2 (Mechanistic Classification):** We will use a supervised machine learning approach. First, we will perform feature engineering, creating a rich feature vector for each lncRNA from the network and source data (e.g., RBP binding profile, network topology metrics, chromatin state signature, structural properties). Second, we will train a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model on our curated 'gold standard' set of lncRNAs with known mechanisms. The trained model will then be used to predict the mechanistic class for thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs.
*   **Aim 3 (Target Gene Prediction):** We will use a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm. Starting from a lncRNA node, the RWR simulates a 'walker' that traverses the network, with the final probability of landing on any given protein-coding gene node representing the predicted strength of the regulatory link. This method effectively integrates all paths and types of evidence connecting a lncRNA to a potential target.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and processing (M6); Construct and validate the multi-layered network (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Complete functional module discovery and analysis (M18); Develop and benchmark the mechanistic classifier and target prediction algorithms (M24); Launch beta version of the lncRNA Functional Atlas web portal.
*   **Year 3:** Generate genome-wide predictions (M30); Submit primary manuscripts for publication (M32); Public launch and dissemination of the lncRNA Functional Atlas (M34); Final reporting (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce a suite of transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of non-coding RNA biology and provide a lasting resource for the broader scientific community. The impact will span from generating fundamental knowledge about genome function to enabling new avenues of translational research.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **The lncRNA Functional Atlas:** The principal deliverable will be a comprehensive, publicly accessible web portal and data repository. This Atlas will be the first-of-its-kind resource, providing integrated, multi-evidence-based functional predictions for thousands of human lncRNAs. For any lncRNA of interest, a user will be able to retrieve its predicted biological process (from module analysis), its likely molecular mechanism (from the classifier), a ranked list of its putative gene targets, and a visualization of all supporting evidence (e.g., eCLIP peaks, Hi-C loops). This will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for researchers wishing to study lncRNAs, effectively providing a functional annotation for a large part of the non-coding genome.
2.  **A Validated Computational Framework:** We will deliver a robust, open-source, and reproducible computational pipeline for integrating multi-omic data to predict lncRNA function. This framework itself is a significant contribution, as it can be adapted by other researchers and extended to incorporate new data types or to study lncRNAs in other species.
3.  **A Catalog of High-Confidence Hypotheses:** The project will generate thousands of specific, mechanistically-grounded, and testable hypotheses. For example: 'lncRNA-A acts as a scaffold for splicing factors X and Y to regulate the alternative splicing of gene Z in neurons.' These high-confidence predictions will serve as a roadmap for the experimental community, allowing them to focus their low-throughput, resource-intensive validation efforts on the most promising candidates, thereby accelerating the pace of discovery.
4.  **New Insights into the 'Functional Grammar' of lncRNAs:** By analyzing which features are most predictive of specific functions, our work will uncover the underlying principles that govern how lncRNA sequence and structure translate into biological roles. This will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding the non-coding genome.

**Broader Impact and Applications:**
*   **Impact on Molecular and Cellular Biology:** This project addresses a fundamental question in biology: what is the function of the non-coding genome? By providing a systematic functional map, our work will enable the discovery of novel regulatory pathways and networks that govern cellular identity, differentiation, and response to stimuli.
*   **Translational and Clinical Relevance:** LncRNAs are increasingly implicated as key players in human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. The lncRNA Functional Atlas will provide immediate functional context for disease-associated lncRNAs identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or clinical sequencing. This can help pinpoint causal mechanisms and reveal novel points for therapeutic intervention, such as developing antisense oligonucleotides to target a lncRNA that scaffolds an oncogenic protein complex.
*   **Alignment with NCEMS Mission:** This project epitomizes the goals of the NCEMS research call. It is a community-scale synthesis project that uses only publicly available data to solve a long-standing puzzle. It requires a transdisciplinary team, promotes open science through its public Atlas and open-source code, and includes a clear plan for training graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge data science.

**Dissemination Plan:**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-pronged to ensure maximum impact. The lncRNA Functional Atlas will be our primary vehicle for broad community access. We will submit our findings for publication in high-impact, open-access journals. All code will be shared on GitHub with extensive documentation and tutorials. Finally, we will present our work at major international conferences (e.g., RNA Society, ISMB) and organize workshops to train the community on using our resources, ensuring the project's legacy and fostering future collaborations.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_gemini_10,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,gemini-2.5-pro,A Systems-Level Synthesis of Cellular Responses to Diverse Environmental Stressors,"Cells have evolved intricate networks to survive a wide range of environmental insults, from heat shock to nutrient deprivation. This project seeks to uncover the universal principles of the cellular stress response by synthesizing hundreds of publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. We hypothesize that beneath the stressor-specific responses lies a 'core' stress response network that integrates diverse signals and coordinates a general survival program. A working group of systems biologists, toxicologists, and data scientists will collate and rigorously normalize datasets from yeast, flies, worms, and human cells exposed to dozens of different stressors (e.g., oxidative, genotoxic, osmotic, metabolic). Using advanced analytical techniques, including dimensionality reduction, network inference, and comparative pathway analysis, we will: 1) Decompose the cellular response into conserved, core modules and stressor-specific peripheral modules; 2) Identify the key transcription factors and signaling hubs that orchestrate the core response; and 3) Build a predictive model that, given a new stressor, can forecast which response modules will be activated. This synthesis will provide a fundamental understanding of cellular resilience and the emergent property of stress adaptation, with broad implications for toxicology, disease biology, and aging research.",,"Background And Significance

The ability of a cell to sense, respond, and adapt to environmental stress is a fundamental property of life. From bacteria to humans, organisms are equipped with sophisticated molecular networks that mitigate damage and ensure survival in the face of insults such as temperature shifts, nutrient scarcity, oxidative damage, and exposure to toxins. For decades, molecular and cellular biology has successfully dissected individual stress response pathways in remarkable detail. Seminal research has elucidated the Heat Shock Response (HSR) governed by HSF1, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that monitors proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the DNA Damage Response (DDR) orchestrated by kinases like ATM and ATR, and the Oxidative Stress Response mediated by transcription factors like Nrf2/SKN-1. These studies have provided a deep, yet fragmented, understanding of cellular defense mechanisms. Typically, they focus on a single stressor, a single pathway, and often a single model organism. This reductionist approach, while powerful, has created a significant knowledge gap: we lack a holistic, systems-level understanding of how these distinct pathways are integrated to produce a coherent, robust cellular response. Early genomic studies, such as the landmark work by Gasch et al. (2000) in yeast, revealed a common 'Environmental Stress Response' (ESR), a shared transcriptional program activated by diverse stressors. This provided the first glimpse that beneath stressor-specific adaptations lies a more universal, core program. However, these early studies were limited by the available data and analytical tools. They could not fully decompose the response into its constituent parts, identify the master regulators coordinating the network across different stress types, or generalize these findings across diverse eukaryotic species. Today, we are at a critical juncture. Public data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and the Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE) have become vast digital libraries, housing hundreds of thousands of datasets from experiments probing cellular responses to a myriad of perturbations. Concurrently, advances in computational biology, data science, and machine learning have equipped us with powerful tools for data integration, network inference, and predictive modeling. The time is therefore ripe for a community-scale synthesis effort to integrate this wealth of existing data and address fundamental questions about the emergent property of cellular resilience. This research is critically important because a fragmented understanding of stress responses limits our ability to tackle complex biological problems. Chronic, unresolved cellular stress is a unifying feature of aging and a wide range of human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases (proteotoxic stress), cancer (genotoxic and metabolic stress), and cardiovascular disease (oxidative stress). A systems-level map of the stress response network would provide a powerful framework for understanding the common molecular underpinnings of these disparate diseases. Furthermore, in toxicology and environmental science, we need better methods to predict the cellular impact of the thousands of novel chemicals introduced into our environment. By uncovering the universal principles of stress adaptation, this project will not only solve a long-standing puzzle in fundamental cell biology but also provide actionable insights with broad translational and societal impact. This proposal directly aligns with the research call's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to synthesize public data, answer novel questions about emergence phenomena, and train the next generation of data-savvy biologists.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This research project is designed to transition the study of cellular stress from a collection of individual pathways to an integrated, systems-level science. Our central goal is to define the universal organizational principles of the eukaryotic stress response by synthesizing a massive corpus of public transcriptomic and proteomic data. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research questions, each with a corresponding testable hypothesis. 

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can the global cellular response to diverse environmental stressors be computationally decomposed into a conserved, 'core' functional program and a set of stressor-specific 'peripheral' modules?**
We hypothesize that a substantial and identifiable component of the molecular response is common across a wide array of stressors, constituting a 'Core Stress Response' (CSR). This CSR represents a general survival strategy. We predict this core module will be highly conserved across yeast, flies, worms, and human cells and will be functionally enriched for fundamental processes such as protein quality control (chaperones, proteasome), metabolic reprogramming towards conservation and repair, broad-spectrum detoxification, and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, we hypothesize that 'peripheral' modules will be activated by smaller, specific subsets of stressors and will be enriched for functions that directly counteract a particular insult, such as specific DNA repair enzymes for genotoxins or osmolyte transporters for osmotic shock. To test this, we will apply matrix factorization methods to our integrated multi-species expression dataset. The successful identification of a large, functionally coherent module activated across the majority of stress conditions, alongside smaller, functionally specific modules activated by distinct stressor classes, would validate our hypothesis. The primary deliverable for this aim will be a comprehensive catalog of core and peripheral stress response modules, functionally annotated and conserved across species.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the key regulatory hubs, such as transcription factors and signaling kinases, that orchestrate the Core Stress Response and integrate signals from diverse stress-sensing pathways?**
We hypothesize that the CSR is not a simple aggregation of independent pathways but is coordinated by a limited set of master regulatory hubs that function as signal integrators. We predict that these hubs will include well-established stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) like HSF1, ATF4, and p53, as well as key signaling nodes like the MAPK and TOR pathways. Our hypothesis states that these factors will be identified by network inference algorithms as having high centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness) and connectivity specifically to the genes within the CSR module. To test this, we will construct a global regulatory network from our expression data. We will then validate our computationally predicted hubs by cross-referencing with orthogonal public data, such as ChIP-seq databases (e.g., ENCODE) and kinase-substrate databases. We expect to find significant enrichment of the binding motifs for our predicted hub TFs in the promoter regions of CSR genes, providing strong evidence for their direct regulatory role. The expected outcome is a high-confidence map of the core regulatory circuit governing cellular resilience.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can a predictive model be built to accurately forecast the cellular response profile—specifically, the pattern of core and peripheral module activation—to a novel, uncharacterized stressor?**
We hypothesize that the cellular response signature is a predictable, emergent property determined by the type of damage a stressor inflicts. Therefore, a machine learning model can learn the relationship between a stressor's physicochemical properties or known mode of action and the resulting transcriptional and proteomic fingerprint. We predict that a model trained on our large, diverse dataset can forecast which specific combination of our previously defined modules will be activated by a new chemical or environmental insult. To test this, we will train a multi-label classification model (e.g., a random forest or neural network) using stressor features as input and the module activation state as output. We will rigorously evaluate the model's predictive power using a leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation strategy. Success will be defined by the model's ability to achieve high accuracy (e.g., AUC > 0.8) in predicting the activation profile for held-out stressors. The deliverable will be a validated, open-source computational tool for in silico toxicogenomics and stress response prediction.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary Working Group comprising a systems biologist (PI 1), a cell biologist/toxicologist (PI 2), and a data scientist (PI 3), along with their trainees. This structure ensures that deep expertise in computational analysis, biological interpretation, and statistical rigor are integrated at every stage. The project is organized into a logical progression of five phases with clear milestones.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Curation (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase focuses on assembling the comprehensive dataset required for synthesis. We will perform systematic, keyword-based searches of public repositories, primarily NCBI GEO, EBI ArrayExpress (transcriptomics), and PRIDE/MassIVE (proteomics). Our search will target datasets from four key eukaryotic models: *S. cerevisiae*, *D. melanogaster*, *C. elegans*, and human cell lines (*H. sapiens*). Inclusion criteria are stringent: studies must contain appropriate unstressed controls, provide accessible raw or processed data, and have sufficient metadata to characterize the perturbation. We aim to collate over 500 individual datasets, encompassing more than 50 distinct stressors (e.g., heat shock, sodium arsenite, tunicamycin, doxorubicin, UV radiation, glucose starvation). A team of trainees, supervised by the PIs, will manually curate all relevant metadata into a standardized, machine-readable format. This curated metadata catalog will be a key project deliverable.

**Phase 2: Unified Data Processing and Normalization (Months 4-9)**
To enable meaningful integration, data from disparate sources must be processed through a single, uniform pipeline to minimize technical artifacts and batch effects. For all RNA-seq datasets, we will download the raw FASTQ files and process them using a standardized workflow (e.g., STAR for alignment, featureCounts for quantification). For microarray data, raw files will be processed using platform-specific standardized methods (e.g., RMA). Proteomics data will be re-analyzed from raw spectra using a consistent search engine (e.g., MaxQuant). Following initial processing, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq) to the combined expression matrices. The success of our normalization will be rigorously assessed using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), ensuring that biological variance (stressor type, cell type) dominates over technical variance (study of origin). Finally, to facilitate cross-species comparisons, all gene and protein identifiers will be mapped to ortholog groups using the OrthoDB database.

**Phase 3: Decomposing the Stress Response (Aim 1; Months 10-18)**
With the normalized, integrated data matrix, we will address RQ1. We will employ Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an unsupervised machine learning technique well-suited for identifying component parts in complex biological data. NMF will decompose the expression matrix into a set of co-regulated gene modules and their corresponding activation patterns across all experimental conditions. We will determine the optimal number of modules using consensus clustering and model stability metrics. Each resulting module will be subjected to extensive functional annotation using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) against GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway databases. A module will be classified as 'core' if its activation pattern is significant across a high percentage (>75%) of diverse stress conditions; otherwise, it will be classified as 'peripheral'.

**Phase 4: Inferring the Core Regulatory Network (Aim 2; Months 15-24)**
To identify the regulators of the Core Stress Response (CSR), we will apply network inference algorithms. We will use methods like ARACNE or GENIE3, which can infer regulatory relationships (e.g., transcription factor to target gene) from large-scale expression data. We will build a global regulatory network and identify hub proteins by calculating network centrality measures. To validate these computationally-derived hubs, we will perform two orthogonal analyses. First, we will test for the statistical enrichment of known transcription factor binding motifs (from databases like JASPAR) in the promoter regions of genes within the CSR module. Second, we will cross-reference our inferred regulatory links with experimentally-verified interactions from public ChIP-seq and protein-protein interaction databases.

**Phase 5: Developing a Predictive Model (Aim 3; Months 20-30)**
To address RQ3, we will build a predictive model. For chemical stressors, we will generate a feature vector describing their physicochemical properties using tools like RDKit (e.g., Morgan fingerprints, molecular weight). We will then train a multi-label random forest classifier. The input to the model will be the stressor's feature vector, and the output will be a binary vector indicating the activation state ('on' or 'off') of each of our previously identified stress modules. The model's performance will be assessed using a rigorous leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation scheme, measuring metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall. A high-performing model will demonstrate that the cellular response is a predictable emergent property of the stressor's characteristics.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on biomedical research and environmental science. Our contributions will be both conceptual and practical, providing new knowledge, powerful resources, and a new generation of trained scientists.

**Intellectual and Scientific Contributions:**
The primary outcome will be a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular stress. By moving beyond the study of isolated pathways, we will deliver the first **Unified Map of the Eukaryotic Stress Response Network**. This map will detail the components of a conserved **Core Stress Response (CSR)** and a diverse array of stressor-specific peripheral modules. This provides a concrete, data-driven definition of cellular resilience, an emergent property that has been conceptually important but difficult to define mechanistically. Our identification of the **master regulatory hubs** that orchestrate the CSR will pinpoint the critical integration nodes in the cell's decision-making circuitry, revealing how diverse threat signals are channeled into a coherent survival program. These findings will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, fundamentally altering textbook models of cell biology.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The knowledge and tools generated will have significant translational potential. In **disease biology**, our framework will illuminate the common molecular underpinnings of aging and chronic diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration, which share a foundation of unresolved cellular stress. The regulatory hubs of the CSR represent novel therapeutic targets for developing 'resilience-enhancing' drugs that could broadly protect against age-related cellular decline. In **toxicology and drug development**, our predictive model (Aim 3) will constitute a powerful new **in silico screening tool**. It will enable the rapid prediction of a novel chemical's cellular impact and mode of action from its structure alone, reducing costs, accelerating safety testing, and aligning with the '3Rs' goal of reducing animal testing.

**Open Science and Community Resources:**
In alignment with the research call's principles, all outcomes will be made openly available to the scientific community. We will develop a **publicly accessible web portal** that will serve as a central resource. This portal will provide interactive access to our integrated, normalized dataset, the defined gene/protein modules, the inferred regulatory networks, and our predictive model. This will empower researchers worldwide to explore our data, test their own hypotheses, and accelerate their research. All analytical code, pipelines, and workflows will be meticulously documented and shared on a public GitHub repository with a permissive open-source license, ensuring full reproducibility and reusability.

**Training and Workforce Development:**
This project is intrinsically designed as a training platform. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the Working Group, receiving immersive, hands-on training at the intersection of cell biology, data science, and systems biology. They will gain invaluable skills in managing large-scale data, developing robust computational pipelines, and working within a collaborative, multidisciplinary team—precisely the skills needed for the future biomedical workforce. We will foster their development through regular joint lab meetings, an annual in-person 'data-thon' workshop, and co-mentorship from all PIs. This project will thus directly contribute to training the next generation of leaders in data-intensive biological research.

**Long-Term Vision:**
This project will lay the foundation for a long-term, sustainable research program. The created data resource and analytical framework will be extensible, allowing for the future incorporation of new data types (e.g., metabolomics, epigenomics) and new organisms. The collaborative network established through this Working Group will foster follow-up projects, such as experimentally validating novel hub regulators or applying our predictive model in partnership with environmental agencies or pharmaceutical companies.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_grok_01,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,grok-4,Emergent Resilience in Cellular Stress Responses: Synthesizing Proteomic and Genomic Data,"This working group proposes a community-scale synthesis project to investigate emergent resilience in cellular stress responses by integrating publicly available proteomic and genomic datasets from repositories such as ProteomeXchange, ArrayExpress, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Emergence here refers to how individual molecular adaptations under stress conditions, like heat shock or oxidative damage, collectively give rise to robust cellular survival mechanisms that are not predictable from isolated components. The project tackles a fundamental question: How do transient molecular perturbations evolve into stable, emergent stress-tolerant states across diverse cell types and organisms? By synthesizing data from yeast, mammalian cells, and plant models, we will develop novel analytical strategies, including Bayesian network modeling and temporal pattern recognition algorithms, to map these emergent transitions and predict vulnerability points in stress pathways.

This initiative differs substantially from existing ideas by focusing exclusively on stress-induced resilience rather than signaling networks, microbial communities, epigenomics, protein interactions, single-cell heterogeneity, viral evolution, organelle interactions, metabolic networks, stem cell differentiation, or biomolecular condensates. It explores a unique angle of temporal dynamics in stress adaptation, emphasizing non-disease contexts like environmental stressors, unlike pathology-focused ideas.

The collaboration unites experts in stress biology, genomics, computational modeling, and environmental physiology from at least four labs across North America, Europe, and Asia, including early-career researchers from minority-serving institutions. This transdisciplinary team is necessary due to the vast, heterogeneous datasets and the need for specialized tools in time-series analysis, which exceed single-lab capacities. NCEMS support will enable cloud-based data integration platforms, virtual hackathons, and mentorship programs for trainees, ensuring inclusive participation and adherence to open science principles.

Key activities include harmonizing stress-response datasets, applying machine learning to identify emergent motifs in resilience networks, and validating models with independent public data. This will solve long-standing puzzles, such as the molecular basis of hormesis, and foster innovative strategies like predictive simulations of stress outcomes. All synthesized data, code, and workflows will be shared via open repositories like Figshare and GitHub, promoting FAIR principles and reproducible science. Graduate students and postdocs will lead sub-analyses, gaining hands-on training in collaborative data synthesis and cross-disciplinary communication, thus building a data-savvy workforce. This project aligns with the funding organization's mission by catalyzing multidisciplinary teams to address emergence in molecular biosciences through public data synthesis, tapping diverse talent, and advancing fundamental insights into cellular adaptability.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular stress responses represent a cornerstone of molecular biology, enabling organisms to adapt to environmental challenges such as heat shock, oxidative damage, nutrient deprivation, and chemical toxins. These responses involve intricate networks of molecular interactions that maintain homeostasis and promote survival. At the core of these mechanisms are proteomic and genomic adaptations, where proteins and genes are dynamically regulated to mitigate stress-induced damage. For instance, heat shock proteins (HSPs) act as molecular chaperones to refold denatured proteins, while transcription factors like HSF1 orchestrate genome-wide changes in gene expression. Genomic responses often include upregulation of stress-responsive genes, such as those involved in antioxidant defenses or DNA repair pathways. Proteomic shifts, on the other hand, encompass post-translational modifications, protein turnover, and complex assembly, which collectively buffer cellular perturbations.

The concept of emergence in biology posits that complex behaviors arise from interactions among simpler components, yielding properties not evident in isolated parts. In the context of cellular stress, emergent resilience refers to how transient, localized molecular changes coalesce into stable, system-level tolerance. This phenomenon is exemplified by hormesis, where low-level stress enhances resistance to subsequent higher stressors, a process observed across taxa from yeast to mammals. Publicly available data repositories have amassed vast amounts of proteomic and genomic information, including mass spectrometry-based proteomes from ProteomeXchange and microarray/RNA-seq data from ArrayExpress and GEO. These datasets capture stress responses in diverse models: Saccharomyces cerevisiae under heat stress, human cell lines exposed to oxidative agents, and Arabidopsis thaliana facing drought.

A comprehensive literature review reveals significant advancements in understanding individual components of stress responses. Seminal works by Lindquist (1986) elucidated the role of HSPs in protein folding, while Gasch et al. (2000) mapped genome-wide transcriptional responses in yeast to environmental stresses using microarrays. More recent studies, such as those by Richter et al. (2010), have integrated proteomics to reveal dynamic protein abundance changes during oxidative stress. Computational approaches have also progressed; for example, Bayesian networks have been employed by Pe'er et al. (2001) to infer regulatory relationships from genomic data, and time-series analyses by Bar-Joseph et al. (2012) have identified temporal patterns in gene expression. In plant biology, studies like those by Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki (2006) highlight genomic adaptations to abiotic stresses, paralleling animal models.

Despite these advances, key gaps persist. Most studies focus on static snapshots or isolated pathways, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of emergence. For instance, while proteomic data reveal protein-level changes, integration with genomic data is rare, limiting insights into how gene expression drives protein network reconfiguration over time. Long-standing puzzles, such as the molecular basis of hormesis, remain unresolved: why do low-dose stressors prime cells for resilience, and how do these effects manifest across evolutionary divergent organisms? Limitations include data heterogeneity—datasets vary in formats, experimental conditions, and quality—making synthesis challenging for single labs. Moreover, existing research often emphasizes disease contexts, like cancer or neurodegeneration, overlooking non-pathological environmental adaptations crucial for ecology and evolution.

This research is important and timely because climate change and environmental pollution are amplifying cellular stresses globally, affecting agriculture, biodiversity, and human health. Understanding emergent resilience could inform strategies for engineering stress-tolerant crops or therapeutics. The explosion of public data, coupled with advances in AI and cloud computing, makes now an opportune moment for synthesis. By addressing these gaps through multidisciplinary collaboration, this project aligns with the funding organization's mission to tackle emergence phenomena, fostering novel insights that transcend individual disciplines. It promises to resolve puzzles like the transition from transient perturbations to stable tolerance, potentially revealing universal principles of cellular adaptability. This work is distinct from related fields, such as signaling networks (e.g., MAPK pathways) or microbial communities, by exclusively probing temporal emergence in stress resilience across eukaryotes, emphasizing synthesis over new data generation. In an era of big data, such integrative efforts are essential to unlock deeper biological understanding and train a workforce adept at transdisciplinary synthesis. (712 words)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses a fundamental question in molecular and cellular biosciences: How do transient molecular perturbations under stress evolve into stable, emergent stress-tolerant states across diverse cell types and organisms? To dissect this, we pose three specific, interrelated research questions that guide our synthesis efforts.

First, what are the key molecular motifs and temporal patterns that characterize the transition from initial stress responses to emergent resilience? This question focuses on identifying recurring patterns in proteomic and genomic data, such as feedback loops or oscillatory behaviors, that underpin resilience. For example, in yeast under heat shock, we aim to trace how initial upregulation of HSP genes leads to proteome-wide stabilization.

Second, how do these emergent properties vary across evolutionary divergent models, such as yeast, mammalian cells, and plants, and what conserved mechanisms underlie cross-species resilience? This explores universality versus specificity, questioning whether motifs like chaperone-mediated protein refolding are conserved or adapted differently in response to stressors like oxidative damage or drought.

Third, can we predict vulnerability points in stress pathways where emergent resilience fails, and how might these inform interventions for enhancing cellular tolerance? This targets predictive modeling, identifying nodes where perturbations disrupt resilience, such as bottlenecks in antioxidant gene networks.

To address these, we formulate testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Emergent resilience arises from Bayesian-inferred network motifs involving time-delayed feedback between genomic transcription and proteomic modifications, predicting that disrupting these motifs (via simulated perturbations) will abolish tolerance in models. We expect to identify 5-10 core motifs, such as HSP-HSF1 loops, that recur across datasets, with temporal lags of 30-120 minutes post-stress.

Hypothesis 2: Conserved emergent mechanisms, like redox-sensitive transcription factors, will dominate in oxidative stress responses across models, while species-specific adaptations (e.g., plant-specific dehydration-responsive elements) will modulate heat stress. Predictions include >70% overlap in core resilience genes between yeast and mammals, but <50% with plants, validated by meta-analysis of GEO datasets.

Hypothesis 3: Vulnerability points correspond to low-redundancy nodes in synthesized networks, where simulated knockdowns reduce resilience by >50%, as measured by survival metrics derived from public viability assays. We predict that targeting these points could enhance hormesis, with models forecasting 20-30% improved tolerance under low-dose pre-stress.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive atlas of emergent resilience motifs, predictive models for stress outcomes, and open-source tools for temporal pattern recognition. Deliverables encompass: (1) harmonized datasets integrating >500 proteomic and genomic entries; (2) Bayesian networks mapping transitions; (3) validated predictions of vulnerability points; and (4) training modules for trainees.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative data synthesis and validation. For Hypothesis 1, we will apply temporal pattern recognition algorithms to time-series data, using cross-validation to assess motif robustness. Hypothesis 2 involves phylogenetic comparative analyses on synthesized datasets, with statistical tests (e.g., Fisher's exact test) for conservation. Hypothesis 3 employs in silico perturbations via network simulations, validated against independent public datasets not used in model building, ensuring generalizability. Validation metrics include accuracy scores (>80% for predictions) and reproducibility checks via shared workflows. If hypotheses are falsified, we will refine models, e.g., incorporating additional data modalities. This approach ensures scientific rigor, leveraging collaborative expertise to yield novel insights into emergence, with outcomes advancing fundamental knowledge and practical applications in biotechnology.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on existing publicly available data, integrating proteomic and genomic datasets to investigate emergent resilience without generating new experimental data. We will draw from major repositories: ProteomeXchange for mass spectrometry-based proteomic data (e.g., PRIDE archive entries on stress-induced proteomes in yeast and human cells); ArrayExpress for microarray data on gene expression under heat and oxidative stress; and GEO for RNA-seq time-series datasets, including those from mammalian fibroblasts, Arabidopsis under drought, and yeast under various stressors. Selection criteria include datasets with temporal resolution (e.g., samples at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes post-stress), coverage of at least three model organisms (yeast, mammals, plants), and metadata on stress types (heat shock, oxidative damage, etc.). We anticipate synthesizing >500 datasets, totaling ~10 TB, prioritized for quality (e.g., high replicate numbers, standardized annotations) via automated filtering scripts.

Analytical methods will combine computational modeling and machine learning for data integration and insight generation. First, data harmonization: We will use ontology-based mapping (e.g., Gene Ontology terms for stress pathways) and normalization techniques (e.g., quantile normalization for expression data, label-free quantification for proteomics) to create unified datasets. Tools like MultiQC and custom R/Python pipelines will ensure quality control, addressing batch effects with ComBat or surrogate variable analysis.

Core approaches include Bayesian network modeling to infer causal relationships between genomic and proteomic variables. Using bnlearn in R, we will construct dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) that capture temporal dependencies, incorporating priors from literature (e.g., known HSP interactions). For temporal pattern recognition, we will develop algorithms based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs, via TensorFlow) to identify motifs like oscillatory gene expression or delayed protein accumulation. Machine learning will identify emergent motifs: unsupervised clustering (e.g., t-SNE for dimensionality reduction) followed by supervised classification (e.g., random forests) to predict resilience states from molecular features. Vulnerability points will be simulated using network perturbation analyses in Cytoscape, with robustness tested via bootstrap resampling.

Although no new experiments are conducted, our 'experimental design' analog involves in silico controls: baseline models using non-stress datasets for comparison, and negative controls by randomizing temporal orders to test motif specificity. Replicates are inherent in meta-analysis, aggregating multiple independent studies for statistical power. Validation uses hold-out datasets (20% of total) not involved in model training, with cross-model comparisons (e.g., yeast-derived motifs tested on plant data).

The project timeline spans 36 months, divided into phases with milestones. Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and harmonization (Milestone: Integrated database on cloud platform, deliverable: Shared repository with >300 datasets). Virtual kickoff meeting and trainee onboarding. Year 2 (Months 13-24): Model development and motif identification (Milestone: Bayesian networks and ML algorithms implemented, deliverable: Preliminary atlas of resilience motifs, including 5-10 key patterns). Bi-annual virtual hackathons for collaborative analysis, with trainees leading sub-tasks. Year 3 (Months 25-36): Validation, prediction, and refinement (Milestone: Validated models with >80% accuracy, deliverable: Predictive simulations and vulnerability maps). Final synthesis workshop and dissemination.

Statistical analysis plans include hypothesis testing with adjusted p-values (Benjamini-Hochberg for multiple comparisons), effect sizes (Cohen's d for motif significance), and confidence intervals for predictions. Power analyses will ensure sufficient dataset size (e.g., n>100 per stress type for robust inference). All analyses adhere to reproducible practices, with code versioned on GitHub and workflows containerized via Docker.

This approach requires transdisciplinary collaboration across four labs: stress biology (USA), genomics (Europe), computational modeling (Asia), and environmental physiology (Canada), including minority-serving institutions. NCEMS support is essential for cloud resources (e.g., AWS for data storage/processing) and virtual platforms, exceeding single-lab capabilities. Trainees (4 graduate students, 2 postdocs) will participate in all phases, gaining skills in data synthesis and cross-disciplinary communication through mentorship programs. (862 words)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will yield several key contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences, foremost a comprehensive atlas of emergent resilience motifs derived from synthesized proteomic and genomic data. This atlas will map temporal transitions from transient perturbations to stable tolerance states, revealing novel patterns such as time-delayed feedback loops in HSP networks and conserved redox motifs across organisms. We anticipate solving puzzles like the molecular underpinnings of hormesis, demonstrating how low-dose stressors prime emergent resilience through specific genomic-proteomic interactions. Deliverables include predictive models that forecast stress outcomes, identifying vulnerability points for potential interventions, and open-source analytical tools (e.g., Bayesian network pipelines) that advance methodological strategies in synthesis research.

Broader impacts extend beyond academia. Insights into cellular adaptability could inform biotechnology applications, such as engineering stress-resistant crops for agriculture amid climate change, or developing therapeutics that enhance cellular resilience in non-disease contexts like aging or environmental exposure. By emphasizing non-pathological stressors, this work fills a gap in ecology and evolutionary biology, potentially guiding conservation efforts for organisms facing habitat stress. The project's focus on diverse models (yeast, mammals, plants) promotes generalizable principles, fostering interdisciplinary applications in fields like synthetic biology and environmental science.

Potential for follow-up research is substantial. Validated models could inspire hypothesis-driven experimental studies (e.g., CRISPR-based validation of predicted vulnerabilities), while the synthesized datasets provide a foundation for expanded syntheses incorporating additional omics layers (e.g., metabolomics). Collaborations may extend to new partners, such as industry labs for applied resilience engineering, or international consortia for global stress data integration. The transdisciplinary team, including early-career researchers from minority-serving institutions, will seed long-term networks, promoting inclusive science.

Dissemination plans emphasize open science: All data, code, and workflows will be deposited in repositories like Figshare, GitHub, and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We will publish findings in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature Communications for synthesis overviews, PLOS Computational Biology for methods), aiming for 4-6 peer-reviewed articles over the project duration. Outreach includes presentations at conferences (e.g., ASMB, ISMB), webinars, and public datasets for community use. Training outcomes will be disseminated via open educational resources, such as online modules on data synthesis, benefiting the broader scientific workforce.

The long-term vision is to establish a sustainable framework for emergence research in biosciences, where synthesis becomes a standard tool for tackling complex questions. By training a data-savvy generation through hands-on involvement—trainees leading sub-analyses and hackathons—we build capacity for future multidisciplinary efforts. Sustainability is ensured through open resources that enable replication and extension, potentially attracting further funding for scaled-up initiatives. Ultimately, this project catalyzes a paradigm shift, demonstrating how public data synthesis can unlock fundamental insights into cellular resilience, with ripple effects on science, society, and education.

Cellular polarity is a fundamental property of eukaryotic cells, enabling critical functions such as directed migration, asymmetric cell division, and tissue organization. It refers to the spatial organization of cellular components, where molecules, organelles, and structures are asymmetrically distributed to create functional gradients within the cell. This asymmetry is not inherent but emerges from initially symmetric states through a process known as symmetry breaking. Symmetry breaking in cellular polarity is an emergent phenomenon, where local molecular interactions and feedback loops amplify small fluctuations, leading to large-scale organizational changes. Understanding this process is essential for unraveling how cells respond to environmental cues, maintain homeostasis, and contribute to multicellular development.

The current state of the field has been shaped by decades of research, beginning with seminal studies on model organisms like yeast and Dictyostelium. For instance, in budding yeast, the landmark work by Chant and Herskowitz (1991) identified the role of Cdc42 GTPase in establishing polarity axes during bud formation, highlighting how GTPase cycling creates positive feedback loops that break symmetry. In mammalian cells, similar mechanisms involve Rho family GTPases, such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, which regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane trafficking. Studies by Wedlich-Soldner et al. (2003) demonstrated that stochastic fluctuations in membrane-associated proteins can initiate polarity in yeast, emphasizing the role of noise in emergence.

Advancements in imaging technologies have provided high-resolution insights into polarity dynamics. Live-cell imaging using fluorescent probes has revealed spatiotemporal patterns of polarity markers, such as PAR proteins in epithelial cells, which partition the cell into apical and basolateral domains (Goldstein and Macara, 2007). Transcriptomic profiling, particularly through RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, has uncovered gene expression gradients associated with polarity, linking molecular cues to phenotypic outcomes. Public repositories like the Allen Cell Explorer offer 3D imaging data of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), capturing polarity in various cellular contexts, while the Image Data Resource (IDR) hosts microscopy datasets from diverse experiments, and GEO provides transcriptomic data from polarity-related studies.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on isolated components of polarity, such as specific GTPases or cytoskeletal elements, without integrating multimodal data to model emergence holistically. For example, while imaging reveals spatial distributions, it often lacks molecular depth, and transcriptomics provides gene expression but misses spatial context. This silos approach limits understanding of how symmetric molecular distributions transition to asymmetric states. A key limitation is the oversight of emergent properties arising from feedback loops and noise. Theoretical models, like those based on reaction-diffusion systems proposed by Turing (1952) and adapted by Jilkine and Edelstein-Keshet (2011) for polarity, suggest that diffusion-limited reactions can generate patterns, but these have not been rigorously tested against large-scale, integrated datasets from multiple cell types.

Long-standing puzzles include the role of intrinsic noise in initiating symmetry breaking. In neurons, axon specification involves symmetry breaking, where one neurite becomes the axon while others remain dendrites (Barnes and Polleux, 2009). However, the molecular cues triggering this in uniform environments remain elusive. Similarly, in epithelial cells, the establishment of front-rear polarity during migration relies on feedback between PI3K signaling and actin polymerization, but how these integrate with transcriptomic changes is unclear (Ridley et al., 2003). Existing models often rely on simplified assumptions, ignoring cell-type variability and environmental perturbations.

This research is important because cellular polarity underpins essential biological processes, and its dysregulation is implicated in diseases like cancer, where loss of polarity leads to metastasis (Muthuswamy and Xue, 2012), and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism linked to polarity defects in neuronal migration (Reiner and Sapir, 2013). By synthesizing publicly available data, we can uncover universal principles of emergence without generating new data, aligning with open science and resource efficiency.

The timeliness stems from the explosion of public datasets and computational tools. With advances in AI and simulation, integrating imaging and transcriptomics is now feasible, enabling transdisciplinary insights. This project addresses the need for community-scale synthesis, as individual labs lack the expertise to handle massive datasets or develop complex models. By focusing on symmetry breaking, distinct from related fields like signaling networks or epigenetics, we fill a niche, potentially revealing how emergent phenomena drive cellular complexity. This could transform molecular and cellular biosciences, providing frameworks for predicting polarity responses in health and disease, and fostering innovative strategies for data integration.

In summary, the field has progressed from descriptive studies to mechanistic insights, but integration across data types and disciplines is lacking. Our synthesis approach will bridge these gaps, offering deeper understanding of emergence and its implications for biology and medicine. (Word count: 752)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is driven by a central overarching question: What molecular cues and feedback loops drive the emergence of polarized states from initially uniform cellular environments? To address this, we break it down into specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) that leverage integrated imaging and transcriptomic data to uncover principles of symmetry breaking in cellular polarity. These questions are designed to be addressed through data synthesis, without generating new experimental data, and will guide the development of spatiotemporal models.

RQ1: How do spatial distributions of key polarity regulators, such as Rho GTPases and PAR proteins, evolve from symmetric to asymmetric states in diverse cell types? This question focuses on identifying patterns in high-resolution imaging data from epithelial cells and neurons. We hypothesize that initial stochastic fluctuations in membrane localization of Cdc42 and PAR-3 amplify through positive feedback loops, leading to stable polarity axes. Predictions include observable gradients in fluorescence intensity over time, with asymmetry emerging within 10-30 minutes in migratory cells, as supported by preliminary data from the Allen Cell Explorer. Expected outcomes are curated datasets of polarity trajectories and quantitative metrics of symmetry breaking onset.

RQ2: What transcriptomic changes correlate with symmetry breaking events, and how do they reinforce molecular feedback loops? Here, we integrate GEO transcriptomic profiles with imaging to map gene expression dynamics. Our hypothesis is that genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling (e.g., ACTB, MYO genes) and signaling (e.g., PIK3CA) are upregulated asymmetrically during polarity initiation, creating reinforcement loops that stabilize asymmetry. Predictions posit that differential expression analysis will reveal enrichment of feedback-related pathways, such as Rho signaling, in polarized versus symmetric states. Deliverables include integrated spatio-transcriptomic maps and correlation networks linking genes to spatial patterns.

RQ3: What role does intrinsic noise play in initiating and propagating symmetry breaking, and how does it interact with deterministic cues across cell types? This explores variability in datasets, hypothesizing that noise in molecular concentrations acts as a trigger, amplified by nonlinear feedback, leading to robust polarity in noisy environments but failure in low-noise conditions. Predictions include simulation results showing that noise levels above a threshold (e.g., 10-20% variance in GTPase activity) are necessary for breaking symmetry, validated against IDR imaging perturbations. Outcomes will be agent-based models quantifying noise thresholds and their universality.

RQ4: Can universal principles of polarity emergence be derived from integrated models, and how do perturbations affect these principles? We hypothesize that partial differential equation (PDE) models, parameterized by fused data, will reveal conserved mechanisms like reaction-diffusion instabilities across cell types. Predictions include model simulations predicting polarity reversal under simulated perturbations (e.g., actin depolymerization), matching observed data patterns. Deliverables encompass validated models and a framework for predicting emergent behaviors.

These hypotheses are testable through computational synthesis. Validation will involve cross-dataset comparisons: for RQ1, deep learning-based segmentation of imaging data to quantify asymmetry metrics (e.g., polarity index = (max - min intensity)/mean), tested for statistical significance using bootstrapping. For RQ2, differential expression tools like DESeq2 will identify significant genes (adjusted p < 0.05), correlated with spatial features via Pearson coefficients. RQ3 will use stochastic simulations to compare noise-amplified versus deterministic models, validating against empirical variance in datasets. RQ4 employs PDE solving (e.g., via finite element methods) and sensitivity analysis to test perturbation effects, with goodness-of-fit metrics (e.g., RMSE < 0.1) ensuring model accuracy.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A comprehensive database of integrated polarity data; (2) Novel simulation tools for symmetry breaking; (3) Peer-reviewed publications on emergent principles; (4) Training modules for trainees. These will resolve puzzles like noise's role in initiation, providing predictive insights. By focusing on well-defined questions, this approach ensures scientific rigor, with hypotheses grounded in literature (e.g., Altschuler et al., 2008 on noise in polarity) and validated through reproducible workflows. The transdisciplinary nature will yield broader insights, such as applications to tissue engineering, where controlling polarity could enhance organoid formation. Overall, this framework advances molecular biosciences by synthesizing data to test emergence hypotheses systematically. (Word count: 712)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on publicly available data, integrating high-resolution imaging and transcriptomic datasets to model emergent symmetry breaking in cellular polarity. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with the call's emphasis on community-scale synthesis. The approach involves a collaborative working group of polarity biologists, imaging specialists, mathematicians, and bioinformaticians from institutions in the US (e.g., University of California), Africa (e.g., University of Cape Town), and Australia (e.g., University of Melbourne), ensuring diverse expertise and perspectives.

Data sources include: (1) Allen Cell Explorer, providing 3D fluorescence microscopy of iPSCs and epithelial cells with polarity markers (e.g., actin, tubulin); datasets encompass over 10,000 images of live-cell dynamics. (2) Image Data Resource (IDR), hosting microscopy from polarity studies (e.g., IDR0001 for yeast budding, IDR0052 for neuronal axonogenesis), including time-lapse series of symmetry breaking. (3) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), with transcriptomic datasets like GSE134379 (epithelial polarity RNA-seq) and GSE145191 (neuronal differentiation), totaling >500 samples. Additional sources may include BioImage Archive for supplementary imaging. Data selection criteria prioritize datasets with spatial (imaging) or temporal (transcriptomic) resolution relevant to polarity, filtered for quality (e.g., high signal-to-noise ratio >10).

Analytical methods begin with data curation and integration. We will standardize formats using tools like Bio-Formats for imaging and FastQC for transcriptomics, ensuring compatibility. Integration fuses spatial imaging with transcriptomic data via spatial transcriptomics emulation: deep learning models (e.g., U-Net architecture) will segment imaging to extract features like protein localization gradients, then map these to gene expression profiles using correlation-based alignment (e.g., canonical correlation analysis). For pattern detection in symmetry breaking, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on labeled datasets will identify asymmetry onset, quantifying metrics such as eccentricity and orientation entropy.

Computational modeling employs two complementary approaches. First, partial differential equations (PDEs) to model reaction-diffusion systems: equations like ∂u/∂t = D∇²u + f(u,v) for activator-inhibitor pairs (e.g., Cdc42 as activator, RhoA as inhibitor) will simulate spatiotemporal evolution. Parameters will be fitted to integrated data using optimization algorithms (e.g., least-squares minimization via SciPy). Second, agent-based simulations (ABM) using platforms like NetLogo or custom Python code, where agents represent molecules with rules for diffusion, binding, and feedback. Noise will be incorporated via stochastic terms (e.g., Langevin equations), allowing perturbation simulations (e.g., varying noise levels or 'knocking down' genes virtually).

The experimental design is computational, with 'virtual experiments' testing hypotheses. Controls include baseline symmetric states from datasets, compared to perturbed conditions (e.g., simulated inhibitor addition). Replicates are achieved through bootstrapping (n=1000) on dataset subsets for robustness. Sensitivity analyses will assess model stability under parameter variations (±10%).

Statistical analysis plans include: (1) Descriptive statistics for data characterization (means, variances). (2) Inferential tests: t-tests or ANOVA for comparing symmetry metrics across cell types (α=0.05, power=0.8). (3) Machine learning validation: cross-validation (k=5) with accuracy metrics (F1-score >0.85). (4) Model fitting: Bayesian inference for parameter estimation, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to quantify uncertainty.

Timeline spans 36 months, divided into phases with milestones:

- Months 1-6: Team assembly and data curation. Milestone: Curated database of 50+ integrated datasets, hosted on Zenodo.

- Months 7-12: Development of deep learning tools for pattern detection. Milestone: Trained CNN models with validation reports, shared via GitHub.

- Months 13-18: PDE and ABM model construction and parameterization. Milestone: Initial simulations of symmetry breaking in epithelial cells, with preliminary results presented at a virtual workshop.

- Months 19-24: Perturbation analyses and cross-cell type comparisons. Milestone: Comprehensive models for neurons, including noise role quantification.

- Months 25-30: Validation, integration, and tool refinement. Milestone: Unified framework for polarity emergence, validated against independent datasets.

- Months 31-36: Dissemination and training. Milestone: Open-access publications, tools, and trainee-led webinars.

Quarterly virtual meetings and two in-person workshops (supported by NCEMS) will facilitate collaboration. Trainees (4 graduate students, 2 postdocs) will lead sub-tasks, gaining skills in data synthesis. All workflows will be reproducible, using Jupyter notebooks and Docker containers. This approach ensures rigorous, transdisciplinary synthesis, addressing the project's scale beyond single-lab capabilities. (Word count: 912)

(3) Innovative analytical tools, including deep learning algorithms for detecting asymmetry patterns, distributed as open-source software on GitHub, fostering new research strategies in spatial biology.

The project's impact extends beyond academia. By uncovering mechanisms of polarity emergence, it will inform biomedical applications, such as cancer therapies targeting polarity loss in metastatic cells or regenerative medicine for directing stem cell polarity in tissue engineering. Broader societal benefits include enhanced understanding of developmental disorders linked to polarity defects, potentially guiding diagnostic tools. The transdisciplinary collaboration will stimulate innovation, bridging biology, mathematics, and informatics, and promoting diverse talent from underrepresented regions (Africa, Australia).

Potential for follow-up research is substantial. Validated models could be extended to in silico drug screening, simulating how compounds disrupt polarity feedback loops. Collaborations may expand to include physicists for advanced simulations or clinicians for disease modeling, leveraging NCEMS networks. Long-term, this could seed larger initiatives, like a global polarity data consortium, sustaining synthesis efforts.

Dissemination plans emphasize open science. Findings will be published in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature Cell Biology, eLife) with preprints on bioRxiv. We aim for 4-6 papers: one on data integration, two on models, one on noise roles, and synthesis reviews. Tools and datasets will be deposited in BioImage Archive and GEO, with workflows in Protocol Exchange. Public engagement includes webinars, a project website, and conference presentations (e.g., ASCB meetings). Trainees will co-author outputs and lead workshops, building their careers in data-savvy science.

The long-term vision is to establish synthesis as a cornerstone for studying emergence in biosciences, creating a paradigm where integrated data drives discovery. Sustainability will be ensured through open resources, encouraging community contributions and adaptations. By training the next generation in collaborative, reproducible methods, the project cultivates a workforce equipped for complex biological questions. Overall, this aligns with the call by advancing fundamental knowledge, fostering partnerships, and maximizing public data's value, with ripple effects in education, innovation, and health.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_grok_03,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,grok-4,Emergent Collective Behavior in Molecular Motors: Synthesizing Kinetics and Structural Data,"This proposal outlines a synthesis project to examine emergent collective behavior in molecular motors by integrating publicly available kinetic, structural, and simulation data from databases like PDB, KinetiX, and BioModels. Emergence in this context involves how individual motor proteins, such as kinesins and myosins, coordinate to produce amplified, directional forces in cellular transport and contraction. The project addresses: How do local motor interactions scale up to emergent macroscopic movements, like vesicle trafficking or muscle contraction? Using data from in vitro and in vivo studies across species, we will develop multiscale models incorporating stochastic simulations and graph-based analyses to predict collective motor dynamics.

Distinct from existing ideas, this focuses on motor protein collectives and kinetics, steering clear of omics integrations, microbial ecology, gene regulation, networks, heterogeneity, evolution, organelles, metabolism, differentiation, or condensates. It pioneers a kinetics-structural synthesis for mechanical emergence, a fresh domain.

Collaboration involves biophysicists, structural biologists, kinetic modelers, and engineers from labs in Europe, South America, and the Middle East, including underrepresented groups. The project's scale demands shared expertise in high-dimensional data fusion, necessitating NCEMS support for computational clusters, virtual reality visualization tools, and trainee workshops.

Core tasks include dataset harmonization, applying reinforcement learning to model motor cooperation, and testing predictions against public benchmarks. This will illuminate puzzles like motor jamming and yield novel tools for simulating emergent mechanics. All outputs will be shared openly on GitLab and Dryad, promoting team science. Postdocs and students will co-develop models, honing skills in collaborative research. This initiative catalyzes multidisciplinary synthesis, resolves fundamental questions in cellular mechanics, and builds a diverse, data-proficient workforce, embodying the funding mission.",,"Background And Significance

Molecular motors are essential nanoscale machines that convert chemical energy into mechanical work, powering critical cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and muscle contraction. Proteins like kinesins, dyneins, and myosins operate along cytoskeletal filaments, including microtubules and actin, to generate directed motion. Individually, these motors exhibit well-characterized behaviors: kinesins, for instance, walk processively along microtubules in 8-nm steps, hydrolyzing ATP to produce force on the order of piconewtons. Myosins, similarly, interact with actin to facilitate muscle shortening or vesicle movement. However, the true complexity arises when these motors function collectively, giving rise to emergent behaviors that cannot be predicted solely from single-molecule properties.

Emergence in biological systems refers to the phenomenon where complex patterns and functionalities arise from the interactions of simpler components. In the context of molecular motors, emergent collective behavior manifests as coordinated actions that amplify forces, enable directional transport against loads, or result in self-organized structures. For example, in vesicle trafficking, multiple kinesins and dyneins cooperate to transport cargo over long distances, often switching directions or overcoming obstacles through tug-of-war mechanisms. In muscle contraction, thousands of myosin heads interact with actin filaments to produce macroscopic force, exhibiting phenomena like synchronization and load-sharing. These collective dynamics are crucial for cellular homeostasis, yet our understanding remains fragmented due to the challenges in bridging scales from single molecules to ensembles.

The current state of the field has advanced significantly through single-molecule studies and small-scale ensembles. High-resolution structural data from techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have elucidated motor conformations, such as the nucleotide-bound states of kinesin-1 (PDB ID: 1BG2) and myosin II (PDB ID: 1DFK), revealing how ATP binding and hydrolysis drive conformational changes. Kinetic studies, including stopped-flow experiments and optical tweezers, have quantified rates of motor attachment, stepping, and detachment. For instance, research by Block et al. (2003) in Nature demonstrated that kinesin processivity increases under load, while Howard's group (1997) in Annual Review of Physiology modeled myosin force generation. Simulation data from molecular dynamics (MD) and coarse-grained models further simulate these processes, as seen in works by Karplus and McCammon (2002) in Nature Structural Biology.

Despite these advances, key gaps persist. Most studies focus on isolated motors or small groups, failing to capture how interactions scale to large collectives. For example, in vitro gliding assays show motors propelling filaments, but they often ignore stochastic fluctuations and heterogeneity in real cellular environments. Long-standing puzzles include motor jamming, where high densities lead to traffic jams on cytoskeletal tracks, as observed in fungal hyphae (Konishi et al., 2018, PNAS) and axonal transport (Reis et al., 2012, Biophysical Journal). Another limitation is the disconnect between structural snapshots and kinetic time series; structural data provide static views, while kinetics offer dynamic rates, but integrating them to model emergence is rare. Existing models, such as mean-field approximations by Klumpp and Lipowsky (2005) in PNAS, predict bidirectional transport but oversimplify spatial arrangements and force feedback.

Furthermore, cross-species comparisons are underexplored. Data from model organisms like yeast, Drosophila, and mammals reveal variations in motor kinetics—e.g., human kinesin-1 has a velocity of ~800 nm/s versus ~50 nm/s in fungal counterparts (Visscher et al., 1999, Nature)—yet synthetic analyses across these are lacking. This fragmentation hinders a unified understanding of how local rules govern global emergence, akin to flocking in birds or swarming in bacteria, but at the molecular level.

This research is important and timely because emergent behaviors underpin diseases like neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, where kinesin jamming disrupts axonal transport; Stokin et al., 2005, Science) and muscular dystrophies (linked to myosin dysfunction; Laing and Nowak, 2005, Nature Reviews Genetics). With the explosion of publicly available data—PDB now hosts over 200,000 structures, KinetiX aggregates kinetic parameters, and BioModels provides simulation repositories—synthesis projects can now address these gaps without new experiments. The NCEMS call emphasizes multidisciplinary synthesis to tackle such fundamental questions, making this proposal ideally aligned. By integrating kinetics and structures, we can develop predictive models of collective dynamics, offering insights into cellular mechanics that individual labs cannot achieve due to expertise silos. This is timely amid advances in AI-driven modeling, enabling high-dimensional data fusion to reveal principles of mechanical emergence, potentially inspiring bioengineering applications like synthetic motors or drug targets for motor-related pathologies.

In summary, while the field has detailed single-motor mechanics, the synthesis of collective emergence remains a puzzle. This project fills this void by leveraging diverse data sources and expertise, promising to advance molecular and cellular biosciences through a transdisciplinary lens. (Word count: 752)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is driven by well-defined research questions that probe the emergent collective behavior of molecular motors, focusing on how individual kinetics and structures give rise to macroscopic phenomena. By integrating publicly available data, we aim to address fundamental gaps in understanding motor coordination across scales. The questions are designed to be novel, leveraging synthesis to generate insights unattainable by single-lab efforts, and align with the NCEMS emphasis on compelling scientific questions in molecular and cellular biology.

The primary research question is: How do local interactions among molecular motors, governed by their kinetic and structural properties, scale up to produce emergent collective behaviors such as amplified force generation and directional transport in cellular systems? This overarching question breaks down into three specific sub-questions, each with associated testable hypotheses, predictions, and validation strategies.

Sub-question 1: What kinetic parameters determine the transition from individual motor stepping to collective synchronization in ensembles, and how do these vary across motor types (e.g., kinesins vs. myosins) and species? Hypothesis 1: Synchronization emerges when motor attachment rates exceed detachment rates by a factor of 2:1 under load, leading to cooperative force amplification; this threshold is lower in myosins due to their higher duty ratios compared to kinesins. Predictions: In simulated ensembles, kinesin collectives will exhibit jamming at densities >10 motors per micron of microtubule when detachment rates are high (e.g., >1 s⁻¹), while myosins will maintain synchronization up to densities of 50 motors per micron of actin, resulting in 5-10 fold force amplification. Expected outcomes: Quantitative thresholds for synchronization, visualized through phase diagrams mapping kinetic parameters to collective states. Deliverables include a database of harmonized kinetic parameters and predictive models for motor synchronization.

Sub-question 2: How do structural conformations influence collective dynamics, particularly in scenarios of motor-motor interference or tug-of-war? Hypothesis 2: Structural rigidity in motor neck-linkers (e.g., kinesin's coiled-coil domain) promotes jamming by restricting conformational flexibility, whereas flexible linkers in dyneins enable adaptive cooperation, reducing jamming probability by 30-50% in bidirectional transport. Predictions: Multiscale models integrating PDB structures will show that rigid kinesin ensembles jam at loads >5 pN, halting transport, while flexible dynein-kinesin pairs achieve net velocities of 200-500 nm/s against opposing forces. Cross-species analysis will reveal that mammalian motors, with more rigid structures, are prone to jamming compared to invertebrate counterparts. Expected outcomes: Structural-kinetic maps linking conformational states to emergent behaviors, with simulations predicting jamming hotspots in cellular transport pathways. Deliverables: Graph-based models of motor interactions and validation against public in vivo datasets.

Sub-question 3: Can reinforcement learning algorithms, trained on integrated kinetic-structural data, predict emergent behaviors like traffic flow optimization in crowded cytoskeletal environments? Hypothesis 3: Reinforcement learning models will outperform traditional stochastic simulations by adapting motor strategies (e.g., adjusting stepping rates) to minimize jamming, achieving 20-40% higher transport efficiency in high-density scenarios. Predictions: Trained models will simulate vesicle trafficking with reduced stall times (from 10-20 s to <5 s) by learning cooperative detachment rules, matching empirical data from axonal transport studies. Expected outcomes: Novel analytical tools for predicting collective dynamics, including open-source software for multiscale simulations. Deliverables: A reinforcement learning framework and benchmarked predictions against datasets like those in BioModels.

These hypotheses will be tested through data synthesis and computational modeling, without generating new data. Validation involves cross-referencing model outputs with independent public benchmarks, such as in vitro gliding assay data from repositories like KinetiX and simulation validations from BioModels. Statistical measures, including goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and sensitivity analyses, will assess model robustness. If hypotheses are supported, we expect to resolve puzzles like motor jamming by identifying kinetic-structural determinants; if not, alternative mechanisms (e.g., environmental factors) will be explored iteratively.

Overall, the expected outcomes include multiscale models that bridge molecular details to cellular functions, delivering actionable insights into emergent mechanics. These will be disseminated via open repositories, fostering further research. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with hypotheses grounded in existing literature (e.g., Hendricks et al., 2010, Current Biology on jamming; Arpağ et al., 2014, Cell on tug-of-war) and predictions testable against diverse datasets. By addressing these questions, the project will advance understanding of cellular mechanics, training a new generation in data synthesis and collaborative science. (Word count: 712)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on publicly available data, integrating kinetic, structural, and simulation datasets to model emergent collective behavior in molecular motors. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with NCEMS guidelines. The approach emphasizes multidisciplinary collaboration among biophysicists, structural biologists, kinetic modelers, and engineers from labs in Germany (Europe), Brazil (South America), and Israel (Middle East), including underrepresented groups such as women and researchers from low-resource institutions. This team composition ensures diverse perspectives, with virtual meetings facilitated by NCEMS resources.

Data sources include: (1) Protein Data Bank (PDB) for structural data, accessing over 1,000 entries for motors like kinesin-1 (e.g., PDB: 3KIN), myosin V (PDB: 1W7J), and dynein (PDB: 3VKH), covering conformations from apo to ATP-bound states across species (human, yeast, Drosophila). (2) KinetiX database for kinetic parameters, including attachment/detachment rates, stepping velocities, and force-velocity curves from in vitro studies (e.g., kinesin velocity ~0.8 μm/s, stall force ~6 pN; myosin duty ratio ~0.05-0.2). (3) BioModels repository for simulation data, incorporating MD trajectories and stochastic models of motor dynamics (e.g., Model ID: BIOMD0000000452 for kinesin transport). Additional sources like UniProt for sequence data and public repositories (e.g., Zenodo) for in vivo transport datasets from optical tracking experiments will be used. Datasets span in vitro (single-molecule) and in vivo (cellular) studies across species, ensuring comprehensiveness.

Analytical methods begin with dataset harmonization. We will standardize formats using Python libraries (Pandas, Biopython) to align structural coordinates with kinetic rates. For instance, structural data will be processed via PyMOL and VMD for conformational analysis, extracting features like neck-linker flexibility. Kinetic data will be curated into a unified database, addressing inconsistencies (e.g., normalizing rates to standard conditions like 25°C, 1 mM ATP). Integration will employ graph-based analyses, where motors are nodes, interactions (e.g., force coupling) as edges, using NetworkX to model ensembles.

Core computational approaches include: (1) Multiscale modeling, combining agent-based stochastic simulations (using Gillespie algorithm in StochPy) for individual motor kinetics with coarse-grained MD (via GROMACS) for structural dynamics. Models will scale from single motors to collectives (10-1000 motors) on cytoskeletal tracks, incorporating noise and load feedback. (2) Reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate motor cooperation, implemented in TensorFlow or PyTorch. Agents (motors) will learn optimal strategies (e.g., detachment timing) to maximize transport efficiency, trained on harmonized data with rewards based on velocity and jamming avoidance. Hyperparameters will be optimized via grid search, with training on NCEMS computational clusters handling high-dimensional data (e.g., 10^6 simulations). (3) Graph-based analyses for emergent patterns, using spectral clustering to identify synchronization clusters and percolation theory to predict jamming transitions.

Although no new experiments are conducted, the 'experimental design' analog involves in silico controls: baseline models without interactions (independent motors) versus interactive ensembles, with 'replicates' as Monte Carlo runs (n=100-1000) for statistical robustness. Sensitivity analyses will vary parameters (e.g., ±20% in rates) to test stability. Validation uses public benchmarks, such as comparing simulated velocities to empirical data from Howard (2001) or Lipowsky models.

Timeline and milestones span 36 months: Months 1-6: Team assembly, data curation, and harmonization (Deliverable: Integrated database on GitLab). Months 7-18: Model development, including stochastic simulations and RL training (Deliverable: Preliminary models and interim report). Months 19-30: Analysis of emergent behaviors, hypothesis testing, and validation (Deliverable: Predictive tools and manuscripts). Months 31-36: Refinement, trainee workshops, and dissemination (Deliverable: Final models, open repositories).

Statistical analysis plans include ANOVA for comparing model outputs across conditions, regression models to correlate kinetic parameters with emergent metrics (e.g., force amplification), and bootstrapping for confidence intervals. Bayesian inference will update model parameters based on data fits, ensuring rigor. All workflows will be reproducible, with code versioned on GitLab.

NCEMS support is essential for computational resources (e.g., GPU clusters for RL training, processing terabytes of data) beyond single-lab capabilities, VR tools for visualizing 3D motor ensembles, and workshops for trainees (graduate students and postdocs) to co-develop models, fostering skills in data fusion and team science. This collaborative, transdisciplinary approach will yield innovative strategies for synthesizing molecular data, advancing cellular biosciences. (Word count: 912)

The long-term vision is to establish a sustainable paradigm for synthesis research in cellular mechanics, where integrated data platforms become community resources. This could evolve into a consortium for motor dynamics, securing ongoing funding from sources like NSF or EU Horizon programs. Sustainability is ensured through modular, open-source tools that users can adapt, reducing barriers to entry and encouraging global contributions. Ultimately, this initiative will catalyze multidisciplinary synthesis, yielding deeper insights into life's mechanical foundations and empowering the next generation to tackle complex biological questions through data-driven approaches.

In terms of societal impact, by illuminating motor dysfunction in pathologies, the research could indirectly support drug development, such as modulators of motor kinetics to alleviate jamming in neurodegenerative diseases. Economically, training in computational synthesis will equip trainees for careers in biotech and academia, addressing workforce needs in data-intensive sciences. Overall, the project's outcomes will not only advance scientific knowledge but also embody the NCEMS mission by promoting collaborative, inclusive, and open research that resolves puzzles in molecular biology.

The key question is: How do global physicochemical properties induce emergent phase behaviors that regulate cellular compartmentalization and function? We will integrate data from crowding experiments and simulations to build thermodynamic models predicting phase diagrams and transitions.

This idea differentiates by targeting broad cellular phase transitions and thermodynamics, not condensates, signaling, microbes, epigenomics, PPIs, single-cells, viruses, organelles, metabolism, or stem cells. It employs a unique physicochemical lens, contrasting biological network approaches.

Aligning with the call, it advances emergence understanding through synthesis, collaboration, and education.",,"Background And Significance

The phenomenon of phase separation in cellular environments has emerged as a critical area of study in molecular and cellular biology, offering insights into how cells organize their internal structures without traditional membrane-bound compartments. Historically, research has focused on biomolecular condensates—dynamic, membraneless organelles formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids. These condensates, such as stress granules and nucleoli, have been extensively characterized for their roles in gene expression, signaling, and stress responses. Key studies, including those by Brangwynne et al. (2009) in Science, demonstrated that P granules in C. elegans embryos behave like liquid droplets, driven by weak multivalent interactions. Subsequent work by Hyman and Alberti (2017) in Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology expanded this to include intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) as key drivers of LLPS, with phase behavior modulated by factors like salt concentration, pH, and temperature.

However, the field has largely concentrated on these discrete condensates, often overlooking broader, emergent phase transitions that occur across the entire cellular milieu. Cellular environments are highly crowded, with macromolecules occupying 20-40% of the cytoplasmic volume, as quantified in seminal works by Ellis (2001) in Trends in Biochemical Sciences. This macromolecular crowding influences diffusion, reaction kinetics, and thermodynamic stability, leading to phase behaviors that extend beyond localized condensates. For instance, theoretical models from statistical physics, such as those by Flory-Huggins theory applied to polymer solutions, predict that crowding can induce phase separation into dilute and dense phases, but these have been underexplored in cellular contexts. Recent spectroscopic data, including NMR and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies from repositories like GEO, reveal anomalies in molecular mobility under crowded conditions, suggesting global phase transitions that regulate compartmentalization.

Thermodynamic perspectives further highlight this gap. Works by Sear (2008) in Physical Biology used mean-field theories to model crowding effects on protein stability, showing that excluded volume interactions can shift phase equilibria. Yet, integration with genomic data, such as protein expression profiles from UniProt, remains sparse. Genomic datasets indicate that cellular proteomes are tuned for specific physicochemical properties, like hydrophobicity and charge distribution, which could drive emergent phase behaviors. For example, analyses of yeast proteomes by Gsponer et al. (2008) in Science linked IDP abundance to phase separation propensity, but did not address how these properties manifest in crowded, non-condensate settings.

Despite these advances, significant limitations persist. Current models often treat cells as dilute solutions, ignoring the non-ideal, crowded nature that leads to emergent phenomena—behaviors arising from collective interactions not predictable from individual components. This is evident in puzzles like the 'speed limit' on enzymatic reactions in vivo, where crowding slows diffusion but enhances association rates, as discussed by Zhou et al. (2008) in Annual Review of Biophysics. Long-standing questions remain: How do global physicochemical properties, such as osmotic pressure and intermolecular potentials, induce phase transitions that affect nuclear and cytoplasmic organization? Existing studies on condensates, while informative, do not capture these broader transitions, as they focus on specific molecular assemblies rather than system-wide thermodynamics.

Moreover, methodological gaps hinder progress. Most research relies on reductionist approaches in isolated systems, with limited synthesis of diverse data types. Public repositories like ThermoFisher databases provide thermodynamic parameters (e.g., Gibbs free energies, enthalpies) for macromolecules, but these are rarely integrated with spectroscopic data (e.g., Raman spectra indicating conformational changes) or genomic data (e.g., mutation effects on phase behavior). This fragmentation prevents a holistic understanding of emergence in cellular phase separation.

This research is timely and important because it addresses the call for synthesizing publicly available data to tackle fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences. With the explosion of open data from high-throughput techniques, now is the opportune moment to apply a physicochemical lens to uncover emergent phase transitions. Such insights could revolutionize our understanding of cellular function, explaining phenomena like gene regulation in crowded nuclei or metabolic efficiency in dense cytoplasms. By moving beyond condensates, this project fills a critical void, potentially informing diseases linked to phase dysregulation, such as neurodegeneration, where amyloid formation represents aberrant phase transitions (as reviewed by Knowles et al., 2014 in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology). Furthermore, it aligns with broader scientific goals of emergence research, fostering transdisciplinary collaboration to develop predictive models that bridge physics and biology. In an era of data-driven science, this synthesis effort will not only solve long-standing puzzles but also train a new generation in integrative approaches, ensuring sustained impact on the field.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is driven by a central overarching question: How do global physicochemical properties in crowded cellular environments induce emergent phase transitions that regulate compartmentalization and function in the cytoplasm and nucleus, distinct from biomolecular condensates? To address this, we break it down into specific, detailed research questions (RQs) and associated testable hypotheses. These are designed to be addressed through synthesis of existing data, enabling novel insights via thermodynamic modeling and data integration.

RQ1: What are the key physicochemical parameters (e.g., macromolecular concentration, intermolecular interaction potentials, and osmotic pressure) that drive phase separation in crowded cellular milieus, and how do they differ between cytoplasmic and nuclear environments? Hypothesis 1a: In cytoplasmic settings, higher macromolecular crowding (20-40% volume occupancy, as per Ellis, 2001) will lower the critical concentration for phase separation compared to dilute conditions, leading to the formation of metastable dense phases that enhance reaction rates by 2-5 fold, as predicted by excluded volume effects in Flory-Huggins models. This will be tested by integrating thermodynamic data from ThermoFisher (e.g., Gibbs free energies) with spectroscopic mobility data from GEO, expecting phase diagrams showing binodal curves shifted leftward under crowding. Hypothesis 1b: In nuclear environments, electrostatic interactions (modulated by ionic strength from genomic mutation data in UniProt) will dominate, hypothesizing that phase transitions occur at lower crowding levels due to polyelectrolyte effects, with predictions of coacervate-like phases forming at 10-20% occupancy, validated against NMR spectra indicating reduced diffusion coefficients.

RQ2: How do emergent phase behaviors influence cellular functions such as diffusion-limited reactions and compartmentalization, and what thermodynamic models can predict these transitions? Hypothesis 2a: Emergent phase transitions will create spatial heterogeneities that accelerate diffusion-limited reactions (e.g., enzyme-substrate associations) by confining reactants in dense phases, with a predicted 30-50% increase in effective rate constants under crowding, based on simulations from Minton (2001). We hypothesize this will be evident in integrated datasets showing correlation between phase separation propensity (from thermodynamic parameters) and reaction kinetics data. Hypothesis 2b: These transitions will regulate nuclear compartmentalization by forming dynamic barriers that sequester transcription factors, hypothesizing that phase diagrams will reveal hysteresis in transitions, leading to bistable states that persist post-stimulus, testable by comparing pre- and post-crowding simulation data with genomic expression profiles.

RQ3: Can integrated data from diverse sources yield predictive models for phase diagrams in cellular contexts, and how do these models reveal novel emergent properties not observable in isolated systems? Hypothesis 3a: By synthesizing spectroscopic (e.g., FRAP recovery times), thermodynamic (e.g., enthalpy-entropy compensation), and genomic (e.g., protein sequence hydrophobicity) data, we will develop phase field models predicting critical points with 80% accuracy against validation datasets, hypothesizing emergent cooperativity where small changes in crowding amplify phase separation by orders of magnitude. Hypothesis 3b: These models will uncover hidden variables, such as entropic contributions from solvent structuring, hypothesizing that in nuclei, entropic penalties drive sharper transitions than in cytoplasm, with predictions of tricritical points in phase diagrams.

Expected outcomes include comprehensive phase diagrams for model cellular systems, open-source thermodynamic models, and a database of integrated parameters. Deliverables will comprise peer-reviewed publications on each RQ, a public repository on OSF with curated datasets, and training modules for trainees. Hypotheses will be tested through iterative model building: first, data curation to parameterize models; second, simulation of phase behaviors using tools like GROMACS; third, validation by comparing model outputs to independent datasets (e.g., holdout GEO entries). Validation metrics include root-mean-square error for predicted vs. observed phase boundaries (<10% deviation) and statistical tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distribution matching. If hypotheses are falsified (e.g., no rate enhancement observed), we will refine models by incorporating additional parameters like viscoelasticity. This approach ensures rigor, with clear predictions enabling falsifiability and advancement of molecular sciences through synthesis. (678 words)

Methods And Approach

This project relies exclusively on synthesizing publicly available data, with no generation of new experimental data, aligning with the research call's emphasis on community-scale synthesis. We will leverage diverse datasets to build and validate thermodynamic models of emergent phase transitions.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include UniProt for genomic and proteomic data (e.g., protein sequences, hydrophobicity indices, and mutation effects on stability, accessing over 500,000 entries relevant to human and model organisms). ThermoFisher databases will provide thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and entropies for macromolecules under various conditions (e.g., datasets from isothermal titration calorimetry, ITC, covering 10,000+ compounds). The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) will supply spectroscopic and functional data, including NMR spectra, FRAP mobility measurements, and Raman spectroscopy on cellular crowding (e.g., series GSE series with >1,000 datasets on yeast and mammalian cells under osmotic stress). Additional repositories like PubChem will be used for chemical interaction data, and PDB for structural models to inform interaction potentials. We will curate datasets focusing on non-condensate contexts, excluding those tagged with condensate-related terms (e.g., 'stress granule' or 'nucleolus'). Data integration will use standardized formats (e.g., FASTA for sequences, CSV for thermodynamics) via tools like BioPython and Pandas, ensuring reproducibility.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: The core approach involves phase field modeling to simulate emergent phase behaviors. We will employ the Cahn-Hilliard equation for phase separation dynamics, parameterized with data-derived free energy functionals. Specifically, Flory-Huggins theory will be extended to include crowding effects via effective interaction parameters (chi) calculated from UniProt hydrophobicity and ThermoFisher enthalpies. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS (open-source, with NCEMS-provided licenses for advanced modules) will generate pseudo-trajectories of crowded systems, integrating GEO diffusion data to calibrate models. For nuclear contexts, polyelectrolyte models (e.g., Debye-Hückel approximations) will incorporate ionic strength from genomic data. Data synthesis will use machine learning techniques: random forest regressions to predict phase boundaries from physicochemical features, trained on 70% of curated data and tested on 30%. Dimensionality reduction via PCA will identify emergent variables (e.g., collective entropy terms). All workflows will be scripted in Python/R, with version control on GitHub.

Experimental Design: Though no new experiments, we emulate design through virtual controls. For each model, 'control' scenarios will simulate dilute conditions (0% crowding) versus 'treatment' (20-40% crowding), with replicates generated by bootstrapping datasets (n=100 iterations per condition). Validation will use holdout datasets (e.g., 20% of GEO entries not used in training) to assess model accuracy. Sensitivity analyses will perturb parameters (e.g., ±10% in chi) to test robustness.

Timeline and Milestones: The project spans 24 months. Year 1: Months 1-3: Team assembly and data curation (deliverable: Curated database on OSF with >5,000 integrated entries). Months 4-6: Development of base thermodynamic models (deliverable: Preliminary phase diagrams for cytoplasmic systems). Months 7-9: Integration of nuclear-specific data and MD simulations (deliverable: Trained ML models with validation reports). Months 10-12: Hypothesis testing for RQ1 and RQ2 (deliverable: Interim report and trainee-led workshop). Year 2: Months 13-15: Advanced phase field modeling and emergent property analysis (deliverable: Predictive models for RQ3). Months 16-18: Full validation and refinement (deliverable: Open-source code repository). Months 19-21: Synthesis of findings and manuscript preparation (deliverable: Draft publications). Months 22-24: Dissemination and training evaluation (deliverable: Final report, public webinars).

Statistical Analysis Plans: For hypothesis testing, we will use non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum) to compare predicted vs. observed phase boundaries, with p<0.05 significance. Regression models will be evaluated via R-squared (>0.8 target) and cross-validation RMSE. Uncertainty quantification will employ Bayesian inference in models to provide credible intervals for predictions. Power analyses (using G*Power) will ensure sufficient dataset sizes for detecting effects (e.g., power=0.9 for 20% differences in phase points). This rigorous, milestone-driven approach ensures logical progression, with bi-monthly virtual meetings via NCEMS portals to facilitate collaboration across continents. Trainees (3 graduate students, 2 postdocs) will lead simulation tasks, gaining hands-on experience in data synthesis and modeling. (892 words)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by unveiling emergent phase transitions through data synthesis. Key intended outcomes include the development of predictive thermodynamic models and phase diagrams that elucidate how crowding induces global phase behaviors, distinct from condensates. Specifically, we anticipate generating open-access resources: a comprehensive database integrating >5,000 data points from UniProt, ThermoFisher, and GEO; validated phase field models predicting cellular phase transitions with high accuracy (e.g., 80% concordance with validation data); and analytical tools for simulating crowding effects on reaction kinetics. These will address long-standing puzzles, such as why in vivo reaction rates defy dilute-solution predictions, by revealing emergent properties like cooperative phase shifts that enhance compartmentalization.

Broader impacts extend beyond academia. By providing a physicochemical framework for cellular organization, our findings could inform biotechnology applications, such as designing synthetic cells with tunable phase behaviors for drug delivery or metabolic engineering. In medicine, understanding these transitions may shed light on pathologies involving dysregulated crowding, like in cancer cells with altered nuclear density, potentially guiding therapeutic strategies (e.g., modulating osmotic agents). The project's emphasis on open science—depositing all models, workflows, and data on OSF and PubChem—will democratize access, fostering reproducibility and enabling global researchers to build upon our work.

Potential for follow-up research is substantial. Our models could be extended to incorporate time-resolved data, paving the way for dynamic simulations of phase transitions during cell cycles. This might inspire new collaborations, such as with biophysicists exploring viscoelastic properties or computational biologists integrating AI for real-time predictions. We envision seeding larger consortia, perhaps through NCEMS networks, to apply these insights to organismal scales.

Dissemination plans are multifaceted. We will publish 4-6 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature Communications for models, Biophysical Journal for methods), targeting open-access formats. Conference presentations at venues like the Biophysical Society Annual Meeting and virtual webinars will reach diverse audiences. Public engagement includes blog posts on platforms like Medium and training modules on YouTube, aimed at early-career scientists. To promote inclusivity, we will host online workshops for underrepresented groups, leveraging NCEMS portals.

Long-term vision focuses on sustainability. By training the next generation—trainees will co-author papers and lead sub-projects, gaining interdisciplinary skills in data synthesis and modeling—this project builds a data-savvy workforce. Post-funding, we aim to sustain the collaboration through open repositories and seek follow-on grants (e.g., NSF or EU Horizon) to expand the models. Ultimately, this work will catalyze a paradigm shift, positioning physicochemical emergence as a core principle in cellular biology, with enduring impacts on education, research, and innovation.

Cellular oscillators represent a fundamental aspect of molecular and cellular biology, governing rhythmic processes that are essential for life. These oscillators include well-studied systems such as circadian rhythms, which operate on a roughly 24-hour cycle, glycolytic oscillations that regulate metabolic flux in response to energy demands, and cell cycle oscillators that control division and proliferation. The concept of emergence in these systems refers to how complex, synchronized behaviors arise from the interactions of simpler, independent components, a phenomenon that has intrigued scientists since the early studies of biological rhythms.

The field of chronobiology has made significant strides in understanding individual oscillators. For instance, the discovery of core clock genes like PERIOD and CLOCK in mammals, as detailed in seminal works by Takahashi and colleagues (Reppert and Weaver, 2002), has elucidated the molecular basis of circadian rhythms. Similarly, glycolytic oscillations have been characterized in yeast models, where feedback loops involving phosphofructokinase drive periodic changes in metabolite levels (Richard, 2003). Cell cycle rhythms, driven by cyclin-dependent kinases, have been extensively modeled in fission yeast and human cells (Novak and Tyson, 2003). These studies highlight the intrinsic periodicity of these modules, but they often treat them in isolation, overlooking how they integrate within the cellular milieu.

A key advancement came with the application of dynamical systems theory to biological oscillations. Pioneered by mathematicians like Winfree (1980) in his work on phase models, this approach views oscillators as coupled systems where synchronization emerges through phase locking or entrainment. Kuramoto's model (1975) of coupled oscillators has been adapted to biological contexts, demonstrating how weak couplings can lead to collective synchrony. In cellular biology, this has been applied to phenomena like calcium oscillations in hepatocytes (Dupont et al., 2000), but applications to gene expression and metabolite rhythms remain limited.

Publicly available datasets have revolutionized this field. Repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) provide thousands of time-series transcriptomic profiles from diverse organisms and tissues (Edgar et al., 2002). The Circadian Expression Profiles DataBase (CircaDB) curates rhythmic gene expression data across species, enabling comparative analyses (Pizarro et al., 2013). MetaboLights offers metabolomic time courses, including oscillatory profiles of glycolytic intermediates (Haug et al., 2013). These resources have facilitated meta-analyses, such as those identifying conserved circadian genes across mammals (Hughes et al., 2009).

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on single oscillators or external entrainment cues, such as light for circadian clocks, but neglect internal coupling between distinct oscillatory modules. For example, while it's known that circadian rhythms influence cell cycle progression (Matsuo et al., 2003), the mechanisms of emergent synchronization—where independent rhythms like glycolysis and cell cycle align to produce a unified cellular timing—are poorly understood. This is partly due to the complexity of integrating heterogeneous temporal data: gene expression profiles often have varying sampling rates, and metabolite data may lack synchronization markers.

Limitations in current knowledge include the reliance on reductionist approaches that dissect individual pathways without synthesizing cross-module dynamics. Computational models, while powerful, are often lab-specific and not scalable to community-level synthesis. For instance, agent-based models of oscillator coupling (Garcia-Ojalvo et al., 2004) have not been broadly applied to multi-omics temporal data. Moreover, the field lacks transdisciplinary integration; chronobiologists rarely collaborate with dynamical systems experts to apply synchronization theory to real-world datasets.

This research is important and timely because disruptions in cellular timing underlie numerous pathologies, including cancer, where desynchronized cell cycle and metabolic rhythms promote uncontrolled proliferation (Sahar and Sassone-Corsi, 2009), and sleep disorders like jet lag, which perturb circadian-glycolytic coupling (Reddy et al., 2020). With the explosion of public omics data—GEO alone hosts over 100,000 time-series experiments—the opportunity for synthesis is unprecedented. Addressing emergent synchronization could reveal universal principles of rhythm integration, advancing molecular biosciences.

By synthesizing these data through a collaborative lens, this project fills critical gaps, offering novel insights into how cellular oscillators achieve coherence. It aligns with the growing emphasis on emergence phenomena, as seen in recent calls for integrative biology (NSF, 2022). Timeliness is underscored by advancements in AI-driven time-series analysis, enabling the handling of large, noisy datasets that were previously intractable. Ultimately, this work could transform our understanding of cellular homeostasis, with implications for chronotherapeutic interventions in disease. (Word count: 712)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is driven by a set of well-defined research questions centered on the emergent synchronization of cellular oscillators, leveraging publicly available temporal data to uncover how independent rhythmic modules couple to form coherent cellular timing. The questions are designed to be novel, addressing gaps in molecular and cellular sciences through a transdisciplinary approach that integrates chronobiology, dynamical systems theory, and omics data analysis.

The primary research question is: How do independent oscillatory modules, such as glycolytic and cell cycle rhythms, couple temporally to produce synchronized, emergent rhythms that maintain overall cellular timing across different tissues and organisms? This question probes the mechanisms of internal synchronization without relying on external signals or other confounding factors like microbiomes or epigenetics.

Sub-question 1: What are the patterns of phase relationships and coupling strengths between glycolytic oscillations and cell cycle rhythms in temporal gene expression and metabolite profiles from mammalian tissues? This focuses on identifying empirical evidence of synchronization in datasets from sources like CircaDB and MetaboLights, examining tissues such as liver and muscle where these rhythms are prominent.

Sub-question 2: How can nonlinear dynamics and synchronization theory model the emergence of coupled rhythms from independent oscillators, and what predictions do these models make about stability under perturbations like phase shifts? This question introduces theoretical frameworks to simulate coupling, emphasizing temporal alignment over other interactions.

Sub-question 3: In what ways do emergent synchronized rhythms differ across organisms (e.g., yeast vs. mammals) and tissues, and what universal principles of oscillator coupling can be derived from comparative analyses? This aims to synthesize data from diverse sources to uncover conserved mechanisms of rhythm emergence.

To address these questions, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Glycolytic and cell cycle oscillators exhibit phase-locked synchronization in temporal profiles, where the phase difference stabilizes at a constant value, leading to emergent rhythms with periods that are harmonics of the individual oscillators. Prediction: Analysis of integrated datasets will reveal cross-correlations with lags corresponding to phase locking, observable in at least 70% of mammalian tissue profiles from GEO.

Hypothesis 2: Weak coupling, modeled via Kuramoto-like equations, is sufficient for emergent synchronization, with coupling strength inversely related to the frequency mismatch between oscillators. Prediction: Simulations will show that small perturbations (e.g., simulating jet lag via phase shifts) disrupt synchronization only when coupling is below a critical threshold, validated against real data showing desynchronization in shifted profiles.

Hypothesis 3: Emergent synchronization enhances rhythm robustness, as evidenced by lower amplitude variability in coupled versus isolated oscillators across organisms. Prediction: Comparative metrics from yeast and mammalian data will demonstrate reduced phase noise in synchronized states, with statistical significance (p < 0.05) in meta-analyses.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive database of synchronized temporal profiles, open-source models of oscillator coupling, and peer-reviewed publications detailing novel insights into rhythm emergence. Deliverables encompass: (1) An integrated dataset repository on GitHub with aligned profiles from over 500 time-series experiments; (2) Validated computational models predicting synchronization under various conditions; (3) Workshops training 20+ trainees in dynamics theory and data synthesis.

Hypotheses will be tested through rigorous data synthesis and modeling. For Hypothesis 1, we will use cross-spectral analysis to detect phase locking in empirical data, validating with bootstrap resampling for statistical robustness. Hypothesis 2 will involve numerical simulations of coupled oscillator equations, fitted to data via optimization algorithms, with sensitivity analyses to confirm predictions. Hypothesis 3 will employ comparative statistics, such as Fourier-based amplitude variance metrics, across datasets, using ANOVA to assess differences. Validation will include cross-validation with held-out data subsets and peer review through collaborative workshops. If hypotheses are falsified, alternative models (e.g., stronger coupling regimes) will be explored, ensuring iterative refinement. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with all methods adhering to open science principles for reproducibility. (Word count: 652)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available data, integrating temporal gene expression and metabolite profiling datasets to investigate emergent synchronization in cellular oscillators. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with the research call's emphasis on community-scale synthesis. The approach requires collaboration among experts in chronobiology (from Australia), dynamical systems (from Africa), and omics data analysis (from the US), leveraging NCEMS resources for tools and workshops to enable transdisciplinary insights beyond single-lab capabilities.

Data sources include: (1) Circadian Expression Profiles DataBase (CircaDB), providing rhythmic gene expression data from over 20 tissues across mammals, yeast, and other organisms, with time-series at 2-4 hour resolutions (e.g., datasets from mouse liver showing circadian genes like Per2). (2) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), hosting thousands of temporal transcriptomic datasets, such as GSE series on cell cycle progression in HeLa cells and glycolytic rhythms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including raw microarray and RNA-seq data with sampling intervals from 30 minutes to hours. (3) MetaboLights, offering metabolomic time courses, like MTBLS datasets on glycolytic metabolites (e.g., NADH oscillations) in human fibroblasts and yeast, with mass spectrometry-based profiles.

We will select datasets based on criteria: temporal resolution sufficient for oscillation detection (at least 6 time points per cycle), coverage of glycolytic (e.g., PFK1, HK2 genes/metabolites) and cell cycle (e.g., CCNB1, CDK1) markers, and public availability without restrictions. Approximately 200-300 datasets will be curated, focusing on diverse tissues (liver, muscle, brain) and organisms (yeast, mouse, human) to ensure broad representation.

Analytical methods will center on nonlinear dynamics and synchronization theory. First, data preprocessing: Temporal profiles will be aligned using phase estimation techniques, such as Hilbert transforms to extract instantaneous phases from oscillatory signals (e.g., gene expression levels). Normalization will account for batch effects via tools like ComBat, ensuring comparability across datasets.

Core computational approaches include: (1) Empirical analysis of synchronization: Cross-correlation and phase coherence metrics (e.g., phase locking value, PLV) to quantify coupling between oscillators. For instance, PLV = |<exp(iΔφ(t))>|, where Δφ is the phase difference, will detect locking if PLV > 0.7. (2) Modeling: Nonlinear differential equations, such as coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, dx/dt = (α + iω)x - β|x|^2 x + κ(y - x), where x and y represent phases of glycolytic and cell cycle oscillators, κ is coupling strength. Simulations will use Python libraries like SciPy and JiTCODE for numerical integration. (3) Perturbation analysis: Simulate jet lag effects by introducing phase shifts (e.g., 6-hour delays) and assess resynchronization time using Lyapunov exponents for stability.

The experimental design is computational, with 'experiments' as simulation runs and data subsets serving as replicates. Controls include uncoupled models (κ=0) to baseline emergent behaviors. Replicates will involve bootstrapping (n=1000) on dataset subsets for robustness.

Statistical analysis plans: For hypothesis testing, we will use non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum) for phase coherence distributions, with multiple comparison corrections (Bonferroni). Model fitting will employ Bayesian inference via PyMC3 for parameter estimation (e.g., coupling strength κ), with goodness-of-fit assessed by AIC. Power analyses ensure sufficient dataset size for detecting effects (power > 0.8 at α=0.05). All workflows will be reproducible via Jupyter notebooks shared on GitHub, promoting open science.

NCEMS support is essential for providing high-performance computing resources for simulations, facilitating virtual workshops (3 per year) for team collaboration, and funding trainee participation to build data-savvy skills. This collaborative framework assembles diverse expertise from geographic locations (Australia: chronobiology lab at University of Sydney; Africa: dynamical systems group at University of Cape Town; US: omics lab at Stanford), career stages (PIs, postdocs, students), and institutions, ensuring innovative strategies unattainable in isolation.

Differing by focusing on electrophysiology and ion channels, not overlapping with listed ideas. Team of electrophysiologists, modelers from global labs uses NCEMS for data platforms. Outputs solve excitability puzzles, shared openly, training workforce.",,"Background And Significance

Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the passive transport of ions across cell membranes, playing pivotal roles in cellular excitability, signaling, and homeostasis. These proteins are central to a myriad of physiological processes, including neuronal action potentials, muscle contraction, and cardiac rhythmicity. The field of electrophysiology has long recognized that individual ion channels operate stochastically, with gating behaviors influenced by voltage, ligands, and environmental factors. However, the emergent properties arising from ensembles of these channels—such as the generation of complex electrical behaviors—remain incompletely understood. This proposal seeks to synthesize publicly available data to uncover how stochastic activities at the single-channel level give rise to deterministic, population-level phenomena like action potentials and oscillatory rhythms in neurons and muscle cells.

The current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of isolated datasets from experimental electrophysiology and structural biology. Databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) provide high-resolution structures of ion channels, revealing atomic-level details of gating mechanisms in channels like voltage-gated potassium (Kv), sodium (Nav), and calcium (Cav) channels. Similarly, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) houses extensive electrophysiological recordings, including patch-clamp data from diverse cell types, offering insights into channel kinetics and conductance. Specialized ion channel databases, such as the Ion Channel Genealogy (ICG) and Channelpedia, aggregate functional and pharmacological data. Despite this abundance, these datasets are often siloed, analyzed in isolation, and not integrated to address ensemble-level questions.

A detailed literature review highlights key advancements and persistent gaps. Seminal work by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) modeled neuronal action potentials using deterministic equations, treating ion conductances as continuous variables. This framework has been foundational but overlooks the stochastic nature of channel gating, as later demonstrated by Neher and Sakmann (1976) through single-channel recordings. Subsequent studies, such as those by Sigworth and Neher (1980), quantified noise in channel currents, revealing fluctuations due to random openings and closings. More recent computational models, like those from the Markov chain approaches by Colquhoun and Hawkes (1995), have simulated single-channel stochasticity, but scaling these to ensembles remains computationally intensive and data-limited.

In neuronal contexts, research by Bean (2007) and others has shown how Nav and Kv channel ensembles generate action potentials, yet the transition from stochastic single-channel events to reliable firing patterns is not fully elucidated. For muscle cells, studies on Cav channels in skeletal and cardiac muscle (e.g., Rios and Pizarro, 1991) highlight excitation-contraction coupling, but emergent rhythms like pacemaking in sinoatrial nodes involve complex interactions among multiple channel types. Emergent phenomena, as defined in systems biology (e.g., Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999), arise when collective behaviors exceed the sum of individual components, akin to phase transitions in physics. However, applying this to ion channels has been hampered by the lack of integrated, large-scale data synthesis.

Key gaps include: (1) Limited integration of structural (PDB) and functional (GEO, Channelpedia) data, preventing a holistic view of how molecular structures influence ensemble dynamics; (2) Insufficient modeling of stochastic ensembles across cell types, with most studies focusing on single channels or simplified models; (3) Under-exploration of cross-cell type comparisons, such as between neurons and muscle cells, which could reveal universal principles of excitability; and (4) Challenges in handling big data, requiring multidisciplinary expertise beyond single labs.

These limitations persist because individual labs often lack the computational resources, diverse expertise, and collaborative networks to synthesize disparate datasets. For instance, electrophysiologists may excel in data generation but not in advanced stochastic modeling, while computational biologists might model effectively but overlook biological nuances.

This research is important and timely for several reasons. First, understanding emergent excitability has profound implications for diseases like epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias, and myopathies, where channel dysfunction disrupts ensemble behaviors. For example, mutations in Nav channels cause channelopathies (Cannon, 2006), but predicting ensemble effects from single mutations requires integrated models. Second, the explosion of publicly available data—PDB now exceeds 200,000 structures, and GEO hosts millions of datasets—presents an unprecedented opportunity for synthesis, aligning with the NCEMS call for data-driven insights into emergence phenomena. Third, amid advances in AI and big data analytics, this project can pioneer methodologies for molecular and cellular sciences, fostering open science and training a data-savvy workforce. Finally, by addressing how stochasticity yields emergence, we tackle a fundamental puzzle: how order arises from randomness in biological systems, echoing broader questions in complexity science (Kauffman, 1993). This synthesis is timely as it leverages recent open data initiatives and responds to the need for transdisciplinary collaboration to solve long-standing puzzles in electrophysiology.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses a central question in molecular and cellular biosciences: How do stochastic activities of individual ion channels give rise to emergent, deterministic electrophysiological patterns in cellular ensembles? By synthesizing publicly available data, we aim to uncover the ensemble properties that enable excitability, focusing on neurons and muscle cells. This will be pursued through specific, well-defined research questions (RQs) and testable hypotheses, ensuring scientific rigor and alignment with NCEMS goals for novel insights via data integration.

RQ1: What structural and kinetic features of ion channels, as derived from integrated PDB and GEO datasets, contribute to the stochastic gating behaviors that underlie ensemble excitability? This question targets the molecular foundations, examining how channel structures influence random openings/closings and how these aggregate in populations.

Hypothesis 1a: Channels with higher structural flexibility in gating domains (e.g., voltage-sensing domains in Kv channels) exhibit greater stochastic variance in open probabilities, leading to noisier but more adaptable ensemble currents. Prediction: Analysis of PDB structures will show correlations between flexibility metrics (e.g., B-factors) and variance in GEO-recorded single-channel currents, with flexible channels enabling rapid adaptation in action potential thresholds.

Hypothesis 1b: Integration across channel types (Nav, Kv, Cav) reveals conserved kinetic motifs that stabilize ensemble behaviors despite individual stochasticity. Prediction: Stochastic models will predict that motifs like rapid inactivation in Nav channels reduce ensemble noise, validated by comparing simulated vs. observed GEO data from neuronal spikes.

RQ2: How do ensemble properties, such as channel density and cooperativity, enable the emergence of complex electrical behaviors like action potentials and oscillatory rhythms from stochastic single-channel activities? This explores scaling from single channels to populations, identifying thresholds for emergence.

Hypothesis 2a: Emergent excitability requires a critical density of channels where stochastic fluctuations average out, analogous to phase transitions. Prediction: In models integrating GEO data from neurons, action potentials will emerge only above a threshold density (e.g., 100 channels/μm²), with sub-threshold simulations showing failure to propagate, testable against empirical GEO recordings.

Hypothesis 2b: Cooperativity among channels (e.g., via local ion concentrations) amplifies emergent patterns in muscle cells compared to neurons. Prediction: Stochastic simulations will demonstrate that Cav channel clusters in muscle produce rhythmic contractions with lower variance than dispersed neuronal channels, validated by cross-cell type data synthesis.

RQ3: What methodological innovations in stochastic modeling and data integration can reveal universal principles of emergent excitability across neuron and muscle cell types? This focuses on developing analytical strategies, a key NCEMS objective.

Hypothesis 3a: Hybrid stochastic-deterministic models, incorporating machine learning for parameter estimation from large datasets, will outperform traditional Markov models in predicting emergent behaviors. Prediction: Model accuracy, measured by fit to GEO action potential waveforms, will improve by >20% with ML integration, enabling novel insights into excitability puzzles.

Hypothesis 3b: Cross-cell type synthesis will uncover shared ensemble properties (e.g., noise filtering mechanisms) that generalize excitability principles. Prediction: Integrated models will predict that both neuron and muscle excitability rely on similar stochastic buffering, validated through sensitivity analyses showing conserved parameters across datasets.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A comprehensive database of synthesized ion channel data, publicly shared; (2) Validated stochastic models elucidating emergence; (3) Publications detailing methodological innovations; and (4) Training modules for trainees on data synthesis.

Hypotheses will be tested via iterative data synthesis and modeling. Validation involves comparing model predictions to independent GEO subsets (e.g., 70% training, 30% validation), using metrics like root-mean-square error for waveform fits and statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distribution matching). Sensitivity analyses will assess robustness, ensuring hypotheses are falsifiable. If predictions fail, we will refine models, potentially revealing alternative mechanisms. This approach ensures concrete, testable deliverables, advancing understanding of how molecular stochasticity yields cellular emergence, with broader implications for bioengineering and disease modeling.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available data, integrating datasets from multiple sources to model emergent electrophysiological patterns without generating new experimental data. The approach emphasizes collaboration among electrophysiologists, computational modelers, and data scientists from global labs, leveraging NCEMS resources for data platforms, virtual meetings, and trainee involvement. The team includes experts from the US (e.g., University of California), Europe (e.g., Max Planck Institute), and Asia (e.g., Kyoto University), spanning career stages and institutional types, ensuring diverse perspectives.

Detailed Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for structural data, providing over 5,000 ion channel structures (e.g., Kv1.2: PDB ID 2A79; Nav1.7: 6J8G). We will extract features like gating domain conformations, flexibility (B-factors), and mutation sites. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) will supply electrophysiological recordings, targeting series like GSE134692 (neuronal patch-clamp) and GSE102566 (muscle cell currents), encompassing >10,000 traces of single-channel and whole-cell data for Nav, Kv, and Cav channels. Specialized repositories such as Channelpedia and the Ion Channel Database (ICD) will provide kinetic parameters (e.g., activation curves, time constants) from diverse species and cell types. Additional data from UniProt for sequence annotations and PubChem for pharmacological modulators will enhance integration. All data are publicly accessible, and we will use APIs (e.g., PDB REST, GEOquery) for automated retrieval, ensuring reproducibility.

Comprehensive Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: Data integration will employ a pipeline starting with preprocessing: Structural data from PDB will be analyzed using molecular dynamics tools like GROMACS to quantify conformational variability, generating ensemble statistics. Electrophysiological traces from GEO will be processed with Clampfit or custom Python scripts (using Neo and Elephant libraries) to extract kinetic parameters (e.g., open probabilities, dwell times). Integration will use ontology-based mapping (e.g., via BioLink API) to align structural features with functional kinetics.

Stochastic modeling will be central, building on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) frameworks extended to ensembles. We will develop hybrid models combining Gillespie algorithms for stochastic simulations of channel gating with deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations for ensemble averaging, implemented in NEURON or Brian2 simulators. Machine learning (ML) will optimize parameters: Neural networks (e.g., TensorFlow) will predict kinetic rates from structural features, trained on integrated datasets. For emergence analysis, we will simulate virtual cells with varying channel densities (10-1000 channels) and cooperativity factors, quantifying metrics like action potential threshold and oscillation frequency.

Cross-cell type comparisons will involve meta-analysis: Neuronal data (e.g., cortical pyramidal cells) versus muscle (e.g., cardiomyocytes), using clustering algorithms (e.g., t-SNE) to identify shared patterns. Sensitivity analyses will perturb parameters (e.g., ±10% variance) to test robustness.

Experimental Design: Though no new experiments, the 'design' mirrors in silico experiments with controls. Controls include baseline deterministic models without stochasticity, compared to full models. 'Replicates' will be Monte Carlo runs (n=1000 per condition) to capture variability. Validation splits datasets: 70% for model training, 30% for testing predictions against unseen GEO traces.

Timeline and Milestones: The 3-year project is divided into phases. Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and integration (Milestone: Curated database released on Zenodo). Year 2 (Months 13-24): Model development and initial simulations (Milestone: Preliminary models validated on neuronal data, with a workshop for trainees). Year 3 (Months 25-36): Cross-cell synthesis, refinement, and dissemination (Milestone: Final models for muscle cells, publications submitted). Quarterly virtual meetings and annual in-person workshops (NCEMS-supported) will track progress.

Statistical Analysis Plans: Quantitative validation will use statistical tests: ANOVA for comparing model fits across conditions, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for distribution matching between simulated and empirical data. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) will assess emergence thresholds. Bayesian inference via PyMC3 will quantify uncertainty in stochastic parameters. Power analyses ensure sufficient simulation replicates (e.g., power >0.8 for detecting 10% differences). All analyses will adhere to open science, with code on GitHub.

This methods framework requires NCEMS support for high-performance computing (e.g., cloud resources for simulations) and collaborative tools, beyond single-lab capabilities, fostering transdisciplinary insights into ion channel emergence. (Word count: 912)

Intended contributions include: (1) A unified framework explaining how stochastic channel gating yields deterministic behaviors like action potentials, resolving long-standing puzzles in excitability; (2) Novel stochastic models that integrate structural and functional data, providing predictive tools for channel ensemble dynamics; (3) Identification of universal principles across neurons and muscle cells, such as critical densities for emergence, advancing systems biology; and (4) Methodological innovations in data synthesis and ML-assisted modeling, setting standards for future synthesis research.

Broader impacts extend beyond academia. By uncovering mechanisms of excitability, outcomes could inform treatments for disorders like epilepsy (neuronal hyperexcitability) and arrhythmias (muscle rhythm disruptions), potentially guiding drug design targeting ensemble properties rather than single channels. Applications in bioengineering include designing synthetic cells with tunable excitability for neuromorphic computing or tissue engineering. The project promotes equity by including diverse teams, tapping underrepresented talent, and training a data-savvy workforce through mentorship of graduate students and postdocs in collaborative settings.

Potential for follow-up research is substantial. Validated models could be extended to other cell types (e.g., immune cells) or diseases, fostering new collaborations via NCEMS networks. Open datasets and tools will enable community-driven expansions, such as incorporating epigenetic data for channel regulation. Long-term, this could lead to a global consortium on emergent biosystems, sustaining synthesis efforts.

Dissemination plans emphasize open science: All findings, curated datasets, models, and workflows will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, GitHub) under CC-BY licenses, adhering to FAIR principles. Publication strategy includes high-impact journals like Nature Communications for main results, eLife for methods papers, and PLoS Computational Biology for models.

Differs by neural circuit focus, not viruses or organelles. Collaboration via NCEMS advances insights and training.",,"Background And Significance

Neural plasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize synaptic connections in response to experience, is a cornerstone of adaptive behavior, learning, and memory. At the molecular level, this plasticity emerges from intricate interactions between synaptic proteins and genomic regulatory elements, yet the mechanisms linking these scales remain poorly understood. This proposal addresses emergence phenomena in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing publicly available synaptic proteomics and genomic datasets to uncover how molecular changes in neural circuits give rise to higher-order adaptive behaviors. The current state of the field highlights significant advancements in data generation but underscores a critical need for integrative synthesis.

In recent decades, high-throughput technologies have produced vast repositories of molecular data. For instance, the SynGO database provides comprehensive annotations of synaptic genes and proteins, mapping over 1,100 genes to synaptic functions based on expert-curated ontologies (Koopmans et al., 2019). Similarly, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) hosts thousands of transcriptomic datasets from neural tissues, enabling meta-analyses of gene expression patterns across developmental stages and conditions (Edgar et al., 2002). The BrainSpan atlas offers spatiotemporal transcriptomic profiles from human brain development, revealing dynamic gene expression in specific neural circuits (Miller et al., 2014). These resources have fueled studies on individual components of neural plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by NMDA receptors and AMPA receptor trafficking (Malenka and Bear, 2004).

Literature reviews reveal key insights into synaptic plasticity. Proteomic studies have identified core synaptic proteins like PSD-95 and synaptotagmin, which modulate synapse strength (Sheng and Kim, 2011). Genomic analyses, including those from GEO, have linked transcription factors such as CREB to activity-dependent gene expression, facilitating synaptic remodeling (Flavell and Greenberg, 2008). Integrative efforts, like those using BrainSpan data, have correlated developmental gene expression with circuit maturation, showing how early molecular events shape adult neural architectures (Kang et al., 2011). However, these studies often focus on isolated scales: proteomics on protein interactions, genomics on regulatory networks, without bridging them to emergent circuit-level properties.

Significant gaps persist. First, while individual datasets provide snapshots, their integration is rare, limiting understanding of emergent phenomena where molecular interactions produce unpredictable circuit behaviors. For example, how do subtle proteomic shifts in synaptic scaffolds interact with genomic variations to enable behavioral adaptations, such as fear extinction or skill acquisition? Existing work on organelles (e.g., mitochondrial dynamics in plasticity; Todkar et al., 2019) or viral influences (e.g., retroviral elements in genomic regulation; Jern and Coffin, 2008) does not address neural circuit-specific emergence. Second, methodological limitations in single-lab studies hinder large-scale synthesis; most analyses are confined to small datasets or lack transdisciplinary input, missing broader insights (e.g., computational biology integrated with neurogenetics).

Third, long-standing puzzles remain unsolved, such as the 'plasticity paradox': why do similar molecular changes lead to diverse behavioral outcomes in different circuits? This echoes emergence theory, where complex systems exhibit properties not predictable from parts alone (Holland, 1998). In molecular biosciences, emergence is evident in how gene-protein networks yield cellular behaviors like synaptic scaling (Turrigiano, 2008). Yet, synthesizing data across repositories could reveal these patterns, addressing gaps in understanding adaptive resilience in disorders like autism or Alzheimer's, where plasticity is disrupted (Bourgeron, 2015; Selkoe, 2002).

This research is timely amid the explosion of open data initiatives and the push for synthesis science. The NCEMS call emphasizes community-scale projects that leverage existing data for novel questions, aligning with efforts like the BRAIN Initiative's focus on circuit mechanisms (Bargmann et al., 2014). By focusing on neural circuits rather than viruses or organelles, this proposal differentiates itself, offering a unique lens on emergence. Importantly, it requires multidisciplinary collaboration—neuroscientists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists—to transcend single-lab capabilities, fostering innovative strategies and training the next generation in data-savvy approaches.

The significance extends beyond academia. Insights into emergent plasticity could inform therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders, enhancing cognitive therapies or drug designs targeting molecular circuits. In an era of big data, this synthesis promotes open science, democratizing access to knowledge and addressing inequities in research participation. By tackling these gaps through collaborative synthesis, this project promises to advance molecular and cellular sciences, revealing how molecular emergence underlies behavioral adaptability.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This proposal addresses fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing synaptic proteomics and genomic data to explore emergent plasticity in neural circuits. We pose three specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) that build on identified gaps, focusing on how molecular-level changes integrate to produce circuit-level adaptations and adaptive behaviors. These questions are designed to be addressed through data synthesis, without generating new experimental data, and will leverage transdisciplinary expertise to yield novel insights.

RQ1: How do synaptic protein compositions, as annotated in SynGO, correlate with genomic expression patterns from GEO and BrainSpan across different neural circuits, and what emergent molecular signatures distinguish plastic from rigid circuits? This question targets the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data to identify circuit-specific molecular profiles. We hypothesize that plastic circuits (e.g., hippocampal networks involved in learning) exhibit higher variability in synaptic protein-gene modules compared to rigid circuits (e.g., sensory relay pathways), predicting enriched expression of plasticity-related genes like BDNF and Arc in dynamic networks. Testable predictions include: (i) Correlation coefficients >0.7 between SynGO protein abundances and BrainSpan temporal expression profiles in plastic circuits, versus <0.4 in rigid ones; (ii) Emergent clusters of co-regulated genes/proteins unique to adaptive contexts, validated via network analysis.

RQ2: What are the emergent mechanisms by which activity-dependent genomic changes influence synaptic proteome remodeling, leading to adaptive behavioral outcomes? Building on RQ1, this explores causality in molecular interactions. We hypothesize that genomic perturbations (e.g., upregulated transcription factors from GEO datasets) drive synaptic proteome shifts, resulting in emergent plasticity manifested as enhanced circuit adaptability. Predictions: (i) Causal inference models will show that 60-70% of synaptic protein variations are attributable to upstream genomic regulators; (ii) Simulations of molecular networks will predict behavioral adaptations, such as improved memory consolidation, in circuits with high plasticity indices. These will be tested using Bayesian networks and machine learning on integrated datasets.

RQ3: How can methodological innovations in data synthesis reveal long-standing puzzles in neural plasticity, such as the variability in molecular responses to similar stimuli across developmental stages? This focuses on developing analytical strategies to solve puzzles like the plasticity paradox. Hypothesis: Integrating multi-omics data will uncover hidden variables (e.g., epigenetic modifiers) explaining divergent outcomes, with predictions that developmental stage-specific modules from BrainSpan account for 50% of variability in synaptic responses. Testing involves creating a novel synthesis framework combining graph theory and AI-driven pattern recognition.

Hypotheses will be tested through rigorous computational validation. For each RQ, we will use cross-validation on subsets of data, comparing observed patterns against null models (e.g., randomized networks) to ensure statistical robustness. Expected outcomes include: (i) A comprehensive database of integrated synaptic-genomic profiles for major neural circuits; (ii) Predictive models of emergent plasticity, quantifiable via metrics like plasticity scores (0-1 scale based on molecular dynamism); (iii) Methodological tools, such as open-source software for multi-omics synthesis, shared via repositories like GitHub.

Deliverables encompass peer-reviewed publications detailing findings, interactive web portals for data visualization, and training modules for trainees. Validation strategies include sensitivity analyses to assess model robustness and community feedback through workshops. By addressing these RQs, the project will provide deeper insights into emergence, demonstrating how molecular synthesis yields circuit behaviors not evident in isolated data. This aligns with NCEMS goals by fostering collaborative, transdisciplinary approaches to advance molecular sciences. (Word count: 628)

(2) GEO (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), a repository of over 4,000 neural transcriptomic datasets; we will select high-quality series (e.g., GSE series on activity-dependent gene expression in rodents and humans, totaling ~500 datasets with >10^6 expression profiles). Criteria for selection: public availability, metadata completeness, and relevance to neural plasticity (e.g., post-stimulation expression changes). (3) BrainSpan (brainspan.org), offering RNA-seq data from 16 human brain regions across 8 developmental stages, encompassing ~42 donors and >1,000 samples. We will integrate spatiotemporal profiles of genes overlapping with SynGO entries.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: Data integration will employ a multi-step pipeline. First, preprocessing: Normalize GEO and BrainSpan transcriptomes using DESeq2 for variance stabilization and batch correction via ComBat. SynGO proteomics will be harmonized by mapping proteins to gene identifiers via UniProt. Second, integration: Use multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) to combine proteomic and genomic layers, identifying latent factors representing emergent molecular modules. Network analysis with graph theory (e.g., igraph R package) will construct protein-gene interaction graphs, incorporating STRING database edges for validation.

For RQ1, correlation analyses (Pearson and Spearman) will quantify associations between synaptic compositions and expression patterns, clustered via hierarchical methods to identify plastic vs. rigid circuit signatures. RQ2 will apply causal inference using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian networks (bnlearn package) to model genomic influences on proteomes, with simulations via agent-based modeling to predict behavioral outcomes. RQ3 involves developing a novel AI framework: Train graph neural networks (GNNs) on integrated data to detect hidden patterns, using PyTorch for implementation and SHAP for interpretability.

Unique plant abiotic stress angle. Team collaboration with NCEMS promotes open science and diversity.",,"Background And Significance

Plants face increasingly severe abiotic stresses due to climate change, including drought and salinity, which threaten global food security and ecosystem stability. Understanding how plants adapt at the molecular level is crucial for developing resilient crops. This proposal focuses on emergent phenomena in plant molecular and cellular biosciences, where complex adaptive responses arise from interactions among genes, proteins, and metabolites. Emergence refers to properties that manifest at higher organizational levels, not predictable from individual components alone, such as how gene regulatory networks yield stress tolerance.

The field of plant abiotic stress research has advanced significantly with high-throughput omics technologies. Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have generated vast datasets, publicly available in repositories like The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), Plant Reactome, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). TAIR provides comprehensive Arabidopsis thaliana genomic data, including gene annotations and mutant phenotypes. Plant Reactome offers pathway knowledge for multiple plant species, detailing metabolic and signaling networks. GEO hosts microarray and RNA-seq data from stress experiments across species like rice, maize, and tomato.

Literature review highlights key findings. For drought stress, studies show upregulation of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways, involving transcription factors like DREB and AREB, leading to stomatal closure and osmoprotectant accumulation (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006). In salinity stress, ion transporters such as HKT and NHX maintain cellular homeostasis, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes mitigate oxidative damage (Zhu, 2002). Integrative studies, like those by Walia et al. (2005), used transcriptomics to identify conserved stress-responsive genes across cereals. However, these often focus on single omics layers or species, missing emergent properties from multi-omics integration.

Recent syntheses, such as the meta-analysis by Zhang et al. (2019) on drought transcriptomes, revealed core gene modules but lacked pathway-level integration. Similarly, Wang et al. (2021) integrated metabolomics and proteomics for salinity, identifying novel hubs but not addressing cross-stress emergence. Emergence in biological systems is exemplified by studies like those on yeast stress responses, where network motifs lead to bistable switches (Gasch et al., 2000). In plants, emergent adaptations might involve feedback loops creating robustness, as modeled in signaling cascades (Verslues et al., 2006).

Key gaps persist. First, most research is reductionist, examining isolated pathways rather than holistic networks where emergence occurs. For instance, how do interactions between drought-induced ABA and salinity-triggered calcium signaling create synergistic adaptations? Second, cross-species comparisons are limited, overlooking conserved emergent mechanisms versus species-specific innovations. Third, temporal dynamics are underexplored; stress responses evolve over time, with early signaling leading to late metabolic shifts, potentially revealing phase transitions as emergent phenomena.

Limitations include data heterogeneity: datasets vary in quality, experimental conditions, and formats, complicating integration. Computational challenges arise in modeling large-scale networks for emergence detection. Moreover, single-lab efforts often lack the diverse expertise needed for transdisciplinary synthesis, such as combining plant biology with systems biology and data science.

This research is important and timely. With climate change exacerbating abiotic stresses, synthesizing existing data can uncover emergent adaptations without new experiments, aligning with sustainable science. It addresses food security by informing breeding strategies, potentially enhancing crop yields by 20-30% under stress (as per IPCC reports). Timeliness stems from the explosion of public omics data and advances in AI-driven analysis, enabling novel insights. By fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, this project taps diverse talent, trains data-savvy researchers, and promotes open science, directly responding to NCEMS goals. Ultimately, it solves long-standing puzzles like how molecular chaos yields ordered adaptations, advancing molecular and cellular biosciences.

In summary, this synthesis will bridge gaps by integrating multi-omics data to reveal emergent properties, offering deeper understanding of plant resilience. (Word count: 712)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This proposal addresses fundamental questions on emergent phenomena in plant molecular adaptations to abiotic stresses, specifically drought and salinity, through synthesis of existing public data. We define emergence as higher-level properties arising from molecular interactions, such as network robustness or adaptive thresholds not evident in isolated components.

Research Question 1: What are the conserved and divergent molecular networks underlying emergent adaptations to drought and salinity across plant species? This question explores how gene, protein, and metabolite interactions form emergent stress responses. Hypothesis 1a: Conserved core networks, involving ABA and ROS pathways, will exhibit emergent bistability, where feedback loops create switch-like transitions from stress sensing to tolerance, predictable across Arabidopsis, rice, and tomato. Prediction: Integration of TAIR gene annotations with GEO transcriptomes will reveal shared motifs with >70% overlap in hub genes. Hypothesis 1b: Divergent adaptations will emerge from species-specific modules, such as enhanced ion exclusion in halophytes, leading to unique metabolic tipping points. Prediction: Plant Reactome pathway analysis will identify salinity-specific emergents in tomato but not Arabidopsis, validated by differential network entropy measures.

Research Question 2: How do temporal dynamics in omics data reveal emergent phase transitions in plant stress responses? This targets the evolution of molecular states over stress duration, where emergence might manifest as critical shifts. Hypothesis 2a: Early signaling (0-6 hours) will show chaotic, high-variability expression, transitioning to ordered, low-variability metabolic states (24-72 hours) via emergent synchronization. Prediction: Time-series GEO data will demonstrate reduced Shannon entropy post-transition, testable via dynamic network modeling. Hypothesis 2b: Cross-stress synergies will produce hybrid emergents, like amplified osmoprotectant production under combined drought-salinity, exceeding additive effects. Prediction: Multi-omics integration will quantify synergy scores >1.5 for key metabolites, using statistical interaction models.

Research Question 3: Can methodological innovations in data synthesis uncover hidden emergent patterns not detectable by traditional analyses? This focuses on developing tools for emergence detection. Hypothesis 3a: Machine learning-based network inference will reveal latent emergent properties, such as scale-free topologies with robust hubs, outperforming linear models. Prediction: Algorithms like random forests will predict stress outcomes with >85% accuracy from synthesized data. Hypothesis 3b: Transdisciplinary integration of graph theory and systems biology will enable quantification of emergence via metrics like modularity and criticality. Prediction: Custom workflows will identify critical points where small perturbations lead to large adaptive shifts, validated against literature benchmarks.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A comprehensive database of integrated omics networks for stress adaptations; (2) Novel models of emergent phenomena, published in high-impact journals; (3) Training modules for trainees on data synthesis. Deliverables: Quarterly reports, open-access repositories, and two peer-reviewed papers within two years.

Hypotheses will be tested using computational simulations and statistical validation. For instance, null models (randomized networks) will contrast against observed data to confirm emergence. Validation involves cross-dataset consistency checks and comparison with experimental literature (e.g., matching predicted hubs to known stress genes). If hypotheses are falsified, we will refine models iteratively. This approach ensures rigor, leveraging collaborative expertise to address these questions transdisciplinarily. (Word count: 652)

Methods And Approach

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include TAIR (arabidopsis.org), providing genomic annotations, mutant phenotypes, and expression data for Arabidopsis thaliana (over 30,000 genes). Plant Reactome (plantreactome.gramene.org) offers pathway models for 100+ plant species, including metabolic and signaling networks relevant to stress (e.g., ABA biosynthesis pathways). GEO (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) will supply transcriptomic datasets, such as GSE datasets on drought (e.g., GSE6901 for rice) and salinity (e.g., GSE5097 for Arabidopsis), encompassing RNA-seq and microarray data from time-series experiments (n>500 datasets filtered for quality). Additional repositories like Phytozome and Ensembl Plants will provide comparative genomics for species like tomato and maize. Data selection criteria: high-quality (Phred>30), stress-specific (drought: water deficit; salinity: NaCl>100mM), and multi-omics where possible (e.g., paired transcriptomics-metabolomics).

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: We will employ a multi-step pipeline for data integration and emergence analysis. Step 1: Data Harmonization using tools like Bioconductor (R packages: limma, DESeq2) for normalization and batch correction, ensuring comparability across datasets. Step 2: Multi-Omics Integration via network-based methods; e.g., Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to build co-expression networks, integrated with Plant Reactome pathways using Cytoscape for visualization. Emergence will be quantified using graph theory metrics (e.g., modularity via Louvain algorithm, criticality via percolation thresholds). Machine learning approaches, including random forests and neural networks (TensorFlow), will infer latent interactions and predict emergent states. For temporal dynamics, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) will model time-series transitions, identifying phase changes via entropy calculations.

To detect synergies, we will use multivariate statistical models (e.g., partial least squares regression) to assess interactions between drought and salinity datasets. Custom scripts in Python (NetworkX library) will simulate network perturbations, testing robustness as an emergent property. All workflows will be version-controlled on GitHub for reproducibility.

Experimental Design: Though no new experiments, the synthesis mimics a virtual experimental framework. 'Controls' include unstressed baseline datasets from GEO; 'replicates' are multiple independent studies (n>10 per stress type). Comparative arms: single-stress vs. combined, monocot vs. dicot species. Subgroups will analyze subsets (e.g., early vs. late response) to ensure robustness.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1: Months 1-3: Team formation, data curation (Deliverable: Curated database). Months 4-6: Harmonization and initial network building (Deliverable: Preliminary networks). Months 7-9: Emergence analysis for RQ1 (Deliverable: Interim report). Months 10-12: Temporal modeling for RQ2 (Deliverable: Open repository of models). Year 2: Months 13-15: Methodological innovations for RQ3 (Deliverable: Custom tools). Months 16-18: Integration and validation (Deliverable: Draft manuscripts). Months 19-21: Training workshops for trainees (Deliverable: Educational modules). Months 22-24: Final synthesis and dissemination (Deliverable: Publications, final report).

Statistical Analysis Plans: Differential expression via DESeq2 (FDR<0.05). Network significance tested against random models (permutation tests, n=1000, p<0.01). Machine learning performance via cross-validation (AUC>0.8 threshold). Synergy quantified by interaction terms in ANOVA models. All analyses adhere to open science, with code and data deposited in Zenodo.

This approach requires NCEMS support for collaborative meetings, computational resources, and trainee involvement, beyond single-lab capabilities. (Word count: 852)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will yield significant contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by uncovering emergent adaptations in plants to abiotic stresses through data synthesis. Intended outcomes include a unified framework for understanding how molecular networks generate higher-level resilience, such as bistable switches enabling rapid stress responses. Specifically, we anticipate identifying 50-100 novel emergent motifs, like feedback loops amplifying tolerance, validated across species.

Broader impacts extend to agriculture and environmental science. Insights into conserved adaptations could guide breeding for drought- and salinity-resistant crops, potentially increasing yields in arid regions and supporting food security for billions, as per UN Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, emergent hubs identified might become targets for CRISPR editing, accelerating resilient variety development without field trials.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_grok_09,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,grok-4,Emergent Autophagic Flux in Cellular Homeostasis: Proteomic and Imaging Synthesis,"Using autophagy databases, HPA, and IDR, this models emergent autophagic processes. Differs from metabolism or organelles by flux dynamics. NCEMS supports multidisciplinary synthesis and trainee development.",,"Background And Significance

Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process that maintains homeostasis by degrading and recycling damaged organelles, proteins, and other cytoplasmic components through lysosomal pathways. This process is crucial for cellular adaptation to stress, nutrient deprivation, and disease states, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders. Emergent phenomena in autophagy refer to the complex, non-linear behaviors that arise from interactions among molecular components, leading to system-level properties that cannot be predicted from individual parts alone. Unlike static organelle studies or steady-state metabolism, autophagic flux emphasizes the dynamic turnover rates, which exhibit emergent patterns influenced by feedback loops, spatial organization, and temporal fluctuations.

The current state of the field has advanced significantly with high-throughput technologies generating vast datasets. Proteomic databases, such as the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), provide comprehensive maps of protein expression and localization across human tissues and cells. Imaging repositories like the Image Data Resource (IDR) offer multidimensional microscopy data, including live-cell imaging of autophagosome formation and degradation. Specialized autophagy databases, such as the Autophagy Database and iLIR, catalog genes, proteins, and pathways involved in autophagy. These resources have enabled insights into isolated aspects of autophagy, such as key regulators like LC3, ATG proteins, and mTOR signaling. However, synthesis of these datasets to model emergent flux dynamics remains underexplored.

Literature review highlights key contributions. Pioneering work by Yoshimori (2000) identified LC3 as a marker for autophagosomes, while Klionsky et al. (2016) established guidelines for monitoring autophagic flux using techniques like Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. Proteomic studies, such as those from the HPA consortium (Uhlen et al., 2015), have mapped over 17,000 proteins, revealing autophagy-related expression patterns in health and disease. Imaging analyses from IDR have integrated datasets from projects like the Mitocheck consortium, showing spatiotemporal dynamics of organelle turnover (Neumann et al., 2010). Recent syntheses, like the work of Levine and Kroemer (2019), underscore autophagy's role in cellular homeostasis, but emphasize the need for integrative models to capture emergence.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. First, most studies focus on steady-state measurements rather than flux dynamics, overlooking how rates of autophagosome formation, maturation, and lysosomal fusion create emergent behaviors. For instance, while metabolic flux analysis has been applied to glycolysis (e.g., Shestov et al., 2014), similar approaches for autophagy are limited due to data silos. Second, integration across proteomic and imaging modalities is rare; proteomic data often lack spatial context, while imaging data miss quantitative proteomic depth. This fragmentation hinders understanding of how local molecular interactions scale to cellular-level homeostasis. Third, long-standing puzzles remain, such as how autophagic flux adapts in heterogeneous cellular environments or contributes to disease progression in conditions like Alzheimer's, where flux impairment leads to protein aggregation (Menzies et al., 2017).

Limitations in current knowledge include the reliance on reductionist approaches in single labs, which cannot handle the scale and diversity of public data. Individual studies often generate new data rather than synthesizing existing ones, missing opportunities for novel insights from data integration. Moreover, methodological challenges in quantifying flux—such as distinguishing between autophagosome accumulation and true flux—require transdisciplinary expertise in computational modeling, bioinformatics, and cell biology.

This research is important and timely because it addresses emergence in molecular and cellular biosciences, aligning with NCEMS's mission to synthesize public data for fundamental questions. With the explosion of open-access datasets (e.g., over 10 petabytes in IDR), now is the ideal time for community-scale synthesis. Autophagic flux's emergent properties differ from metabolic or organellar studies by their dynamic, feedback-driven nature, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets for diseases where homeostasis is disrupted. By fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, this project will solve puzzles like flux variability in cancer cells, where autophagy promotes survival (White, 2015). Timeliness is underscored by recent global health challenges, such as COVID-19, where autophagy modulates viral replication (Gassen et al., 2021), highlighting the need for predictive models. Ultimately, this synthesis will advance molecular sciences by providing a framework for understanding complex cellular systems, training the next generation in data-savvy approaches, and promoting open science.

In summary, the field's progress in data generation contrasts with the lag in synthesis, creating an opportunity for this proposal to bridge gaps through emergent modeling of autophagic flux. This work will not only resolve key limitations but also catalyze broader impacts in biomedicine and beyond. (Word count: 712)

This proposal addresses fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing public data to model emergent autophagic flux, focusing on its role in cellular homeostasis. The research is structured around three specific, interrelated questions, each with testable hypotheses, clear predictions, and expected outcomes. These questions leverage the dynamic nature of flux, distinguishing it from static metabolic or organellar studies, and require multidisciplinary synthesis to integrate proteomic and imaging data.

Research Question 1: How do spatial and temporal dynamics of autophagic components integrate to produce emergent flux patterns in cellular homeostasis under stress conditions? This question targets the emergence of system-level behaviors from molecular interactions, such as how localized protein accumulations lead to global flux adaptations. Hypothesis 1a: Integration of HPA proteomic localization data with IDR time-lapse imaging will reveal that autophagosome formation rates exhibit non-linear scaling with stress duration, predicting higher flux efficiency in nutrient-deprived cells compared to steady-state conditions. Prediction: Computational models will show a 20-30% increase in flux throughput in simulated starvation scenarios, validated against literature benchmarks (e.g., Klionsky guidelines). Hypothesis 1b: Cross-dataset synthesis will demonstrate that feedback loops involving ATG proteins create emergent bistability in flux, where small perturbations lead to amplified homeostatic responses. Prediction: In models of oxidative stress, flux will bifurcate into high- or low-activity states, with deliverables including interactive visualizations of these dynamics.

Research Question 2: What are the key proteomic signatures that differentiate autophagic flux from related metabolic processes, and how do they contribute to emergent cellular resilience? This explores distinctions in flux dynamics, such as rate-dependent recycling versus steady-state metabolism. Hypothesis 2a: Mining autophagy-specific databases (e.g., Autophagy Database) alongside HPA will identify unique flux markers (e.g., p62/SQSTM1 turnover rates) that correlate with resilience in disease models. Prediction: Statistical analysis will predict that cells with high flux markers exhibit 15-25% greater survival under proteotoxic stress, tested via meta-analysis of public datasets. Hypothesis 2b: Emergent flux models will hypothesize that integration with metabolic data (e.g., from Reactome) reveals hybrid pathways where autophagy compensates for metabolic deficiencies, predicting novel cross-talk nodes. Expected outcomes include a curated database of flux signatures and predictive algorithms for resilience.

Research Question 3: How can methodological innovations in data synthesis enhance the quantification of autophagic flux across diverse cellular contexts, advancing analytical strategies in molecular sciences? This focuses on developing tools for broader application. Hypothesis 3a: A novel computational pipeline combining machine learning on IDR images and proteomic clustering from HPA will accurately quantify flux in heterogeneous datasets, hypothesizing improved precision over existing methods (e.g., 10-20% reduction in measurement error). Prediction: Validation against gold-standard flux assays in public data will confirm robustness. Hypothesis 3b: Transdisciplinary collaboration will yield open-source workflows that integrate flux modeling with trainee-led simulations, predicting enhanced reproducibility in community-scale projects.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative data synthesis: initial integration using bioinformatics tools, followed by model simulations and statistical validation. Validation involves cross-comparison with independent datasets (e.g., from BioGRID for interactions) and sensitivity analyses to ensure rigor. Expected outcomes include: (1) A comprehensive model of emergent autophagic flux, disseminated as open-access software; (2) Peer-reviewed publications detailing novel insights; (3) Training modules for 10-15 trainees in data synthesis. Deliverables encompass integrated datasets, predictive models, and methodological papers. These will address long-standing puzzles, such as flux impairment in neurodegeneration, by providing testable predictions for future experimental validation. Overall, this framework ensures scientific rigor, with hypotheses grounded in existing literature and designed for falsifiability, fostering deeper insights into cellular emergence.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available data, integrating datasets from multiple sources to model emergent autophagic flux without generating new experimental data. The approach emphasizes collaboration among a multidisciplinary team from cell biology, bioinformatics, computational modeling, and imaging analysis, spanning four labs across the US and Europe. This transdisciplinary effort is essential, as no single lab possesses the combined expertise to handle the scale of data integration and modeling required.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), providing proteomic data on over 17,000 proteins, including expression levels, subcellular localization, and tissue-specific profiles relevant to autophagy (e.g., LC3, ATG5). The Image Data Resource (IDR) will supply high-resolution imaging datasets, such as time-lapse microscopy from the Mitocheck project (over 1 million images) and autophagy-specific screens (e.g., GFP-LC3 puncta formation). Specialized autophagy databases, including the Autophagy Database (containing 200+ genes and pathways) and iLIR (for LC3-interacting regions), will provide molecular interaction data. Additional integration will draw from Reactome for metabolic pathways and BioGRID for protein-protein interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of flux dynamics. All data are publicly accessible via APIs or downloads, with metadata standardized using ontologies like GO terms.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: The project will employ a multi-stage pipeline. Stage 1: Data Harmonization—Use Python-based tools (e.g., Pandas, Biopython) to preprocess and integrate datasets. Proteomic profiles from HPA will be mapped to imaging features in IDR via machine learning algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks in TensorFlow for image segmentation of autophagosomes). Stage 2: Flux Modeling—Develop dynamic models using systems biology frameworks like COPASI for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) simulating autophagosome formation, maturation, and degradation rates. Emergent behaviors will be captured through agent-based modeling in NetLogo, incorporating spatial data from IDR to simulate cellular heterogeneity. Hypothesis testing will involve parameter sweeps to predict flux under stress (e.g., nutrient deprivation simulations). Stage 3: Methodological Innovation—Create a custom R package for flux quantification, integrating proteomic clustering (e.g., k-means on HPA data) with image analysis (e.g., Fiji plugins for puncta tracking). Cross-disciplinary input will refine these tools, ensuring they address flux-specific challenges like distinguishing accumulation from true turnover.

Experimental Design: Although no new data are generated, the synthesis design mimics experimental rigor with virtual 'controls' and 'replicates.' Controls include baseline models without stress perturbations, compared against stressed scenarios. Replicates will be simulated by bootstrapping datasets (e.g., 100 iterations of random subsampling from IDR images). Design factors include cellular contexts (e.g., cancer vs. neuronal cells) and variables like stress type (oxidative, proteotoxic), with outcomes measured as flux rates (e.g., autophagosomes/hour).

Timeline and Milestones: The 36-month project is divided into phases. Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and initial integration; Milestone 1: Harmonized dataset repository (Deliverable: Open-access GitHub repo with 500+ integrated entries). Year 2 (Months 13-24): Model development and hypothesis testing; Milestone 2: Prototype flux models and preliminary results (Deliverable: Working group workshop report and trainee-led simulations). Year 3 (Months 25-36): Validation, refinement, and dissemination; Milestone 3: Final models and analytical tools (Deliverable: Software package and manuscripts). Quarterly virtual meetings and annual in-person workshops will ensure progress, with NCEMS resources supporting coordination.

Statistical Analysis Plans: Quantitative analyses will use inferential statistics in R. For hypothesis validation, ANOVA will compare flux predictions across conditions, with post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's) for multiple comparisons. Machine learning models will be evaluated via cross-validation (e.g., 10-fold) and metrics like AUC-ROC for classification accuracy. Sensitivity analyses will assess model robustness to parameter variations, using Monte Carlo simulations. Significance will be set at p<0.05, with corrections for multiple testing (e.g., Bonferroni). Qualitative aspects, like emergent pattern identification, will employ network analysis (e.g., graph theory in Cytoscape) to quantify connectivity and bistability.

This approach requires NCEMS support for its scale, involving diverse expertise (e.g., bioinformaticians from Lab A, modelers from Lab B) and trainee involvement (e.g., 5 graduate students leading sub-analyses). It adheres to open science by sharing workflows on Zenodo and promotes inclusivity across career stages and institutions. (Word count: 852)

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_grok_10,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,grok-4,Synthesis of Ribosomal Data for Emergent Translational Regulation,"From RiboGalaxy, GEO, and PDB, synthesizing for ribosomal regulation emergence. Question: How ribosomal variations lead to translational specificity? Novel ribosome focus, collaborative via NCEMS, open outputs train future scientists.",,"Background And Significance

The ribosome, a fundamental molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, has long been viewed as a uniform entity across cellular contexts. However, recent advancements in molecular biology have revealed that ribosomes are not monolithic; they exhibit significant heterogeneity in composition, modifications, and interactions, which can profoundly influence translational regulation. This proposal seeks to synthesize publicly available data from diverse sources to uncover emergent phenomena in ribosomal regulation, specifically how variations in ribosomal structure and composition lead to translational specificity. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for addressing fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences, such as how cells achieve precise control over gene expression in response to environmental cues or developmental signals.

The current state of the field is marked by rapid accumulation of high-throughput data on ribosomal components. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) datasets, available through repositories like RiboGalaxy, provide snapshots of ribosome occupancy on mRNAs, revealing translational efficiencies genome-wide. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) hosts extensive transcriptomic and proteomic data, including ribosome-associated RNA sequencing, which captures variations in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modifications and associated proteins. Meanwhile, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers structural models of ribosomes from various organisms, highlighting atomic-level differences in ribosomal subunits. Despite this wealth of data, integration across these platforms remains fragmented, limiting our ability to discern emergent patterns in translational regulation.

A detailed literature review underscores key developments. Early studies, such as those by Ramakrishnan (2002) in Nature, elucidated the core ribosomal structure, earning Nobel recognition. Subsequent work by Woolford and Baserga (2013) in Genetics highlighted rRNA processing and assembly variations. More recently, research by Barna and colleagues (2015) in Cell demonstrated that specialized ribosomes with distinct ribosomal protein compositions preferentially translate specific mRNA subsets, suggesting a 'ribosome code' for translational specificity. In parallel, advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have produced high-resolution structures in PDB, revealing post-transcriptional modifications like methylation and pseudouridylation that alter ribosomal function (Taoka et al., 2018, Nucleic Acids Research). Ribo-seq studies, archived in GEO, have shown context-dependent translational control, such as in stress responses (Ingolia et al., 2009, Science). However, these studies often focus on isolated aspects—structural, compositional, or functional—without holistic synthesis.

Significant gaps persist. First, there is a lack of integrated analyses linking structural variations (from PDB) with functional outcomes (from Ribo-seq in RiboGalaxy and GEO). For instance, how do specific rRNA modifications correlate with altered translation rates of mRNA subsets? Second, emergent phenomena, such as how ribosomal heterogeneity contributes to cellular adaptation or disease, remain underexplored due to the scale of data required. Long-standing puzzles include the mechanisms underlying ribosome specialization in multicellular organisms, where tissue-specific translation is critical (Xue and Barna, 2012, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology). Limitations in current knowledge stem from siloed datasets and the inability of single labs to handle the computational demands of multi-omics integration. Most studies are confined to model organisms like yeast or human cell lines, overlooking evolutionary diversity.

This research is important and timely for several reasons. It addresses the emergence of translational specificity as a complex system property arising from ribosomal variations, aligning with the NCEMS call for synthesizing data to tackle fundamental questions in molecular biosciences. With the explosion of omics data post-genomics era, now is the opportune moment for community-scale synthesis. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted translational regulation in viral infections, where host ribosomes are hijacked (Finkel et al., 2021, Nature). Moreover, dysregulation of ribosomal function is implicated in ribosomopathies and cancers (Pelletier et al., 2018, Nature Reviews Cancer), making insights into emergent regulation vital for therapeutic strategies. By fostering multidisciplinary collaboration—integrating structural biologists, bioinformaticians, and cell biologists—this project will bridge gaps, yielding novel insights beyond individual lab capabilities. It promotes open science, training the next generation in data synthesis, and catalyzes broader impacts in synthetic biology and personalized medicine. In summary, this proposal leverages existing data to illuminate how ribosomal variations give rise to emergent translational behaviors, filling critical knowledge voids and advancing the field toward a unified understanding of gene expression control.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This proposal addresses the overarching question: How do variations in ribosomal structure, composition, and modifications lead to emergent translational specificity in molecular and cellular contexts? To dissect this, we pose three specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) that build upon synthesized data from RiboGalaxy, GEO, and PDB. These questions are designed to be novel, leveraging transdisciplinary synthesis to uncover patterns unattainable through isolated studies.

RQ1: What are the patterns of ribosomal heterogeneity across different cellular and organismal contexts, and how do they correlate with structural variations? This question focuses on integrating structural data from PDB with compositional data from GEO to map variations in ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNA modifications. We hypothesize that ribosomal heterogeneity is not random but follows context-specific patterns; for example, in stress conditions, ribosomes enriched with certain RPs (e.g., RPL38) will exhibit modified peptidyl transferase centers, leading to preferential translation of stress-response mRNAs. Predictions include identifying clusters of ribosomal variants associated with environmental stressors, validated by cross-referencing with Ribo-seq data. Expected outcomes: A comprehensive atlas of ribosomal variants, revealing emergent specificity motifs.

RQ2: How do these ribosomal variations influence translational efficiency and specificity for distinct mRNA subsets? Building on RQ1, this explores functional implications using Ribo-seq from RiboGalaxy integrated with transcriptomic data from GEO. We hypothesize that structural modifications (e.g., 2'-O-methylation on rRNA) alter ribosome-mRNA interactions, resulting in biased translation of mRNAs with specific motifs, such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). Predictions: In developmental contexts, specialized ribosomes will show higher translational efficiency for tissue-specific genes, quantifiable through differential footprinting analysis. Deliverables include predictive models of translation specificity, tested via computational simulations of ribosome-mRNA binding affinities.

RQ3: What emergent regulatory networks arise from ribosomal variations, and how do they contribute to cellular adaptation and disease? This synthesizes insights from RQ1 and RQ2 to model higher-order emergence. We hypothesize that ribosomal variations form feedback loops with cellular signaling, where, for instance, oncogenic mutations in RPs lead to dysregulated translation of proto-oncogenes, promoting cancer emergence. Predictions: Network analyses will reveal hubs of ribosomal regulation, with perturbations simulating disease states showing altered translational landscapes. Outcomes: Integrated network models highlighting emergent phenomena, such as phase transitions in translational control under stress.

Hypotheses are testable through data-driven approaches without new experiments. For validation, we will employ cross-validation techniques: splitting datasets into training and testing sets to assess model accuracy. Hypotheses will be falsified if no significant correlations emerge (e.g., via statistical thresholds like p<0.01). Testing involves machine learning classifiers to predict translational outcomes from structural features, with performance metrics like AUC-ROC >0.8 indicating validity. Expected deliverables: (1) A ribosomal variation database with annotated specificities; (2) Computational tools for predicting translational biases; (3) Peer-reviewed publications detailing emergent models. These will advance molecular biosciences by providing mechanistic insights into translation as an emergent property, fostering hypotheses for future empirical studies. The collaborative framework ensures diverse perspectives, enhancing rigor and innovation. (Word count: 652)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize publicly available data, integrating datasets from RiboGalaxy (ribosome profiling), GEO (transcriptomic and proteomic), and PDB (structural models) to address ribosomal variations and translational specificity. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with NCEMS guidelines. The approach requires collaboration among structural biologists, bioinformaticians, and cell biologists from multiple institutions, leveraging diverse expertise for community-scale analysis.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include RiboGalaxy for Ribo-seq data (e.g., datasets from human, yeast, and Arabidopsis, covering >500 experiments on translational footprints). GEO will provide complementary data, such as RNA-seq (GSE series like GSE129082 for rRNA modifications) and proteomics (e.g., mass spectrometry on RPs from GSE145282). PDB contributes >1,000 ribosomal structures (e.g., 6ZLW for human ribosome with modifications). We will select datasets based on quality metrics (e.g., read depth >10 million, annotation completeness), focusing on diverse contexts like stress, development, and disease (cancer models). Integration will use standardized formats (FASTQ for sequences, PDB for structures), with metadata harmonization via ontologies like Gene Ontology.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: Data synthesis begins with preprocessing: sequence alignment using Bowtie2 for Ribo-seq, normalization via DESeq2 for expression data, and structural alignment with PyMOL for PDB models. To link structure to function, we will employ machine learning (ML) pipelines. For RQ1, clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical) will identify ribosomal variant patterns, integrating RP expression from GEO with structural features from PDB. Feature extraction includes rRNA modification sites (predicted by Modomics tools) and RP stoichiometry (quantified via proteomics).

For RQ2, we will develop translational specificity models using deep learning (e.g., convolutional neural networks in TensorFlow) to predict mRNA-ribosome affinities from sequence motifs and structural data. Differential analysis will compare translational efficiencies (TE = Ribo-seq/RNA-seq ratios) across variants, employing tools like Riborex. For RQ3, network inference with graphical lasso and Bayesian networks will model emergent regulations, simulating perturbations using ordinary differential equations in R.

Experimental Design: Though no wet-lab experiments, the design mimics rigorous controls. 'Controls' include baseline ribosomes (e.g., canonical yeast structures) compared to variants. 'Replicates' are achieved through dataset bootstrapping (resampling 100 iterations) to ensure robustness. Validation uses hold-out sets (70% training, 30% testing) and cross-species comparisons for generalizability.

Timeline and Milestones: The 24-month project is divided into phases. Months 1-3: Team assembly and data curation (deliverable: Curated dataset repository on GitHub). Months 4-9: Analysis for RQ1 (milestone: Ribosomal variant atlas, interim report). Months 10-15: RQ2 modeling (deliverable: Predictive software tool, workshop for trainees). Months 16-21: RQ3 network synthesis (milestone: Integrated models, draft manuscripts). Months 22-24: Validation, dissemination (deliverable: Final database, publications).

Statistical Analysis Plans: Hypotheses will be tested with non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum for comparisons, p<0.05 adjusted for multiple testing via Bonferroni). ML models will use metrics like precision-recall curves and cross-validation F1-scores. Correlation analyses (Spearman) will link variables, with power calculations ensuring >80% power for detecting effect sizes (Cohen's d>0.5). Uncertainty will be quantified via confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses. All workflows will adhere to open science, with code in Jupyter notebooks shared via Zenodo. This methods framework ensures scientific rigor, reproducibility, and transdisciplinary insights. (Word count: 872)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The proposed synthesis of ribosomal data is poised to yield transformative insights into emergent translational regulation, directly contributing to molecular and cellular biosciences. Intended contributions include a comprehensive atlas of ribosomal variations, linking structural heterogeneity (from PDB) to functional specificity (via Ribo-seq and GEO data). This will resolve long-standing puzzles, such as the 'ribosome code,' by revealing how modifications enable selective translation, fostering a paradigm shift from viewing ribosomes as uniform to dynamic regulators.

Broader impacts extend to applications in health and biotechnology. In medicine, models of dysregulated translation could inform ribosomopathy treatments (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia) and cancer therapies targeting oncogenic ribosomes. In synthetic biology, insights into specificity may enable engineered ribosomes for precise protein production. The project promotes equity by including diverse teams (geographic, career stages), training 10+ trainees in data synthesis, building a data-savvy workforce.

Potential for follow-up includes empirical validations (e.g., CRISPR-based ribosome editing) and expanded collaborations, such as with international consortia like the Ribosome Synthesis Network. This could seed larger grants for multi-omics integration.

RNA splicing is a fundamental post-transcriptional process in eukaryotic cells, where introns are removed from pre-mRNA and exons are joined to form mature mRNA transcripts. Alternative splicing (AS) exponentially increases transcriptome diversity by generating multiple isoforms from a single gene, enabling cells to fine-tune protein function, localization, and stability. This process is not merely a linear assembly line but exhibits emergent properties—complex behaviors arising from simple interactions among splicing factors, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and cis-regulatory elements. Emergent phenomena in biological systems, as defined by complexity theory, occur when local interactions lead to global patterns that cannot be predicted from individual components alone. In RNA splicing networks, individual splicing decisions can aggregate into regulatory modules that confer cellular resilience, such as in response to stress, disease, or environmental changes.

The current state of the field has advanced significantly with high-throughput sequencing technologies, revealing that over 95% of human multi-exon genes undergo AS, producing an estimated 100,000+ isoforms across tissues (Pan et al., 2008, Nature Genetics). Public repositories like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) have amassed petabytes of transcriptomic data, including RNA-seq from diverse human tissues, cancers, and model organisms under various conditions. Studies have mapped splicing landscapes in specific contexts, such as neuronal development (Raj et al., 2014, Cell) or cancer progression (Sebestyen et al., 2016, Genome Biology), highlighting roles in isoform-specific functions like synaptic plasticity or oncogenesis.

Literature review underscores key contributions: Early work by Black (2003, Annual Review of Biochemistry) elucidated splicing mechanisms, while recent integrative analyses, such as those by the ENCODE consortium (2012, Nature), integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic data to model splicing regulation. Bayesian approaches have been applied to infer splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) from GTEx data (Li et al., 2016, Science), revealing genetic variants influencing AS. Graph-based methods, like those in network biology (Barabási and Oltvai, 2004, Nature Reviews Genetics), have modeled protein-protein interactions but are underexplored for RNA-level networks. In stress responses, AS contributes to cellular adaptation; for instance, in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's, aberrant splicing of genes like MAPT leads to tauopathies (Mills and Janitz, 2012, Neurobiology of Aging). Environmental stressors, such as heat shock, induce splicing changes via RBPs like SRSF1 (Shalgi et al., 2014, Cell Reports), enabling rapid proteome remodeling.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on isolated splicing events or pairwise interactions, neglecting how these aggregate into emergent networks. Long-standing puzzles include the mechanisms of 'splicing memory'—how transient stresses imprint lasting isoform patterns—and the role of AS in cellular resilience across scales, from single cells to tissues. Limitations include data heterogeneity: datasets vary in sequencing depth, library preparation, and annotation, complicating integration. Single-lab efforts often lack the computational power and interdisciplinary expertise for large-scale synthesis, leading to siloed insights. For example, while TCGA has illuminated cancer-specific splicing (Kahles et al., 2018, Cancer Cell), cross-disease comparisons with GTEx or model organism data (e.g., from SRA) are rare, missing opportunities to uncover universal emergent motifs.

This research is important and timely because it addresses the era of big data in biology, where synthesis can unlock novel insights without new experiments. With the explosion of public transcriptomes—GTEx v8 alone covers 17,382 samples from 948 donors—there is untapped potential to model AS as an emergent system, akin to how systems biology has revolutionized signaling pathways. In neurodegenerative disorders, understanding AS-driven resilience could inform therapies, as splicing modulators like nusinersen treat spinal muscular atrophy (Hua et al., 2011, Nature). Environmentally, AS mediates adaptation to climate-related stresses in model organisms like Drosophila (Long et al., 2019, eLife). Timeliness stems from advances in AI and cloud computing, enabling scalable analysis, and the funding organization's emphasis on synthesis to solve puzzles in molecular biosciences. By targeting post-transcriptional emergence, this project fills a niche unmet by epigenomics or proteomics-focused efforts, promising broader impacts on personalized medicine and evolutionary biology. It promotes inclusivity by involving diverse teams, aligning with calls for equitable science (e.g., NIH's diversity initiatives). Ultimately, revealing how splicing networks emerge fosters a paradigm shift, viewing AS not as noise but as a core driver of cellular complexity and adaptability. (712 words)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses the overarching question: How do individual alternative splicing (AS) decisions aggregate into emergent regulatory networks that enable cellular resilience under stress? To dissect this, we pose three specific, interrelated research questions (RQs), each with testable hypotheses, predictions, and validation strategies. These are grounded in synthesizing public transcriptomic data, focusing on molecular and cellular biosciences without generating new data.

RQ1: What are the core emergent motifs in RNA splicing networks across human tissues and model organisms, and how do they differ under baseline versus stress conditions? Hypothesis 1a: Emergent motifs, such as feedback loops and hubs involving RBPs and splicing factors, will be conserved across species but modulated by stress, with increased isoform diversity in resilient tissues like brain versus susceptible ones like liver. Prediction: Bayesian network analysis will identify 20-30% more interconnected motifs in stress datasets (e.g., neurodegeneration in TCGA) compared to GTEx normals, with hubs enriched for genes like SRSF family. Hypothesis 1b: Stochastic fluctuations in splicing decisions lead to bistable isoform states, conferring memory-like resilience. Prediction: Graph-based models will reveal bistability in 15% of genes, validated by higher variance in isoform ratios post-stress in perturbation data from SRA.

RQ2: How do AS-driven networks contribute to functional outcomes in cellular adaptation, particularly in neurodegenerative disorders and environmental challenges? Hypothesis 2a: In neurodegenerative contexts (e.g., Alzheimer's models), emergent AS networks prioritize isoforms enhancing proteostasis and anti-apoptotic functions, forming resilient subnetworks absent in non-diseased states. Prediction: Integrated analysis will show 25% enrichment of proteostasis genes (e.g., HSPs) in emergent motifs from TCGA neurodegeneration samples versus GTEx controls, with isoform switches correlating to survival outcomes. Hypothesis 2b: Under environmental stress (e.g., heat or toxin exposure in model organisms), AS networks emerge as adaptive buffers, with graph algorithms predicting isoform shifts that mitigate damage. Prediction: Models will forecast 10-20% improved resilience scores (based on simulated perturbation) in networks with high AS diversity, tested against SRA datasets from stressed C. elegans or Drosophila.

RQ3: Can novel computational models predict and visualize isoform-driven emergence, and what methodological innovations are needed for cross-dataset synthesis? Hypothesis 3a: Bayesian inference models, incorporating prior knowledge from RBP binding sites, will outperform traditional methods in predicting emergent network behaviors, achieving >80% accuracy in isoform outcome simulations. Prediction: Cross-validation on held-out data will demonstrate superior AUC in ROC curves for Bayesian vs. frequentist models. Hypothesis 3b: Graph-based algorithms with dynamic visualization tools will uncover hidden hierarchies in splicing networks, enabling identification of novel regulatory layers. Prediction: Tools will detect 30% more emergent connections than static graphs, validated by alignment with known interactions from databases like STRING.

Expected outcomes include a curated isoform database with >1 million entries, predictive models (Bayesian and graph-based) as open-source tools, and visualizations revealing emergent motifs. Deliverables: Peer-reviewed publications on motifs (Year 1), functional impacts (Year 2), and models (Year 3); workshops for trainees.

Hypotheses will be tested via data synthesis: RQ1/RQ2 through harmonized datasets, applying stochastic modeling and network inference; RQ3 via algorithm development and benchmarking. Validation uses independent subsets (e.g., 70/30 train/test split), statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distributions), and external datasets for robustness. Controls include null models (randomized networks) to assess significance (p<0.05 via permutation tests). If hypotheses hold, we expect breakthroughs in understanding AS as an emergent system; if not, refinements will highlight data limitations, guiding future synthesis. This approach ensures rigor, with milestones tied to quarterly virtual meetings for iterative hypothesis refinement. (648 words)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on publicly available transcriptomic data, integrating datasets to model emergent RNA splicing networks without generating new data. We will assemble a working group of 12-15 members from four labs: RNA biology (USA), statistics (Canada), machine learning (Germany), and computational biology (Japan), including early-career researchers from minority-serving institutions.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include GTEx (v8: 17,382 RNA-seq samples from 54 human tissues, focusing on sQTL and isoform quantification); TCGA (11,000+ tumor/normal samples across 33 cancers, emphasizing neurodegeneration-linked cancers like glioma with isoform-level data); and SRA (millions of runs from model organisms like Drosophila, C. elegans, and mice under stress conditions, e.g., heat shock or toxin exposure). Additional resources: ENCODE for RBP binding data, GENCODE for annotations, and perturbation datasets (e.g., CRISPR knockdowns of splicing factors). Data selection criteria: High-quality RNA-seq (>50M reads, stranded), isoform-resolved (e.g., via Salmon or Kallisto quantifications), and metadata-rich for stress categorization. We anticipate synthesizing ~10TB of data, harmonized via standardized pipelines.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: Phase 1 (Data Curation): Develop a cloud-based pipeline using AWS or Google Cloud for downloading and preprocessing via Snakemake workflows. Harmonization involves alignment to GRCh38/hg38 with STAR, isoform quantification with RSEM, and batch correction using ComBat-seq to mitigate technical variances. Curate a comprehensive isoform database with metadata on tissue, stress type, and organism.

Phase 2 (Modeling Emergent Motifs): Apply stochastic modeling with Bayesian inference (using PyMC3) to model splicing decisions as probabilistic events, incorporating priors from RBP motifs (e.g., from CISBP-RNA). Graph-based algorithms (NetworkX and Graph-tool) will construct dynamic networks where nodes are isoforms/exons and edges represent co-splicing probabilities or regulatory interactions, inferred via mutual information or Granger causality. Emergent properties (e.g., hubs, modularity) will be quantified using centrality measures and community detection (Louvain algorithm).

Phase 3 (Prediction and Visualization): Develop novel tools: A Bayesian network predictor for isoform outcomes under simulated stress, trained on integrated data with variational inference for scalability. Graph visualization via Cytoscape plugins for interactive, 3D renderings of emergent networks. Methodological innovations include hybrid models combining Bayesian stats with graph neural networks (GNNs using PyTorch Geometric) for predicting network resilience.

Experimental Design: No wet-lab experiments; instead, in silico designs with controls. For each RQ, split data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets, stratified by dataset/source. Replicates via bootstrapping (n=1000) for robustness. Controls: Null models with shuffled edges to test significance; sensitivity analyses varying parameters (e.g., prior strengths in Bayesian models).

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 (Months 1-12): Data curation and harmonization (Deliverable: Isoform database on Figshare, Q2; Virtual hackathon for pipeline testing, Q3). Milestone: Preliminary motif identification. Year 2 (Months 13-24): Modeling and prediction (Deliverable: Bayesian models and graph tools on GitLab, Q6; Trainee-led sub-analyses on stress subsets, Q7). Milestone: Functional impact analyses. Year 3 (Months 25-36): Validation and refinement (Deliverable: Integrated findings report, Q9; Open workshops, Q10). Milestone: Final models and visualizations.

Statistical Analysis Plans: For hypotheses testing, use non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum) for comparing motif frequencies, with FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg) for multiple comparisons. Predictive accuracy via AUC-ROC and F1-scores; network metrics with permutation tests (p<0.01 threshold). Power analysis (using G*Power) ensures >80% power for detecting 20% differences in emergent features, based on pilot data from subsets.

Collaboration facilitated via Slack, Zoom for bi-weekly meetings, and Git for version control. Trainees (4-6 grad students/postdocs) will lead modules, gaining skills in reproducible workflows (e.g., Jupyter notebooks). This approach ensures scalability, rigor, and alignment with open science, requiring NCEMS support for cloud resources and coordination beyond single-lab capabilities. (852 words)

The core question is: What molecular interactions drive the emergence of lipid rafts and phase separations that modulate membrane fluidity and function in health and metabolic diseases? Differentiating from ideas on metabolic networks or biomolecular condensates, this effort centers on lipid-specific dynamics, using molecular dynamics simulations and clustering algorithms to model emergent behaviors across cell types and conditions.

The working group assembles lipid biochemists, biophysicists, and computational chemists from diverse institutions, including those in developing countries and varying career stages, requiring collaboration to handle the heterogeneity of lipid data.

Cellular membranes are dynamic assemblies of lipids, proteins, and other molecules that serve as the primary interface between cells and their environment. They are not static barriers but exhibit emergent properties arising from the collective behavior of their components. Emergence in this context refers to the spontaneous formation of higher-order structures and functions that cannot be predicted solely from the properties of individual molecules. A key example is the formation of lipid rafts—microdomains enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and specific proteins—that play crucial roles in signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and pathogen entry. Similarly, lipid phase separations contribute to membrane fluidity, curvature, and compartmentalization, influencing processes like endocytosis and exocytosis.

The field of lipidomics has exploded in recent years, driven by advances in mass spectrometry and high-throughput analytical techniques. Public repositories such as LIPID MAPS, Metabolomics Workbench, and MassIVE house vast datasets encompassing lipid profiles from diverse cell types, organisms, and pathological conditions. These resources provide a treasure trove of information on lipid composition, abundance, and spatial distribution. However, the heterogeneity of these datasets—varying in experimental conditions, nomenclature, and metadata—poses significant challenges for integration and analysis. Traditional approaches in membrane biology have often focused on reductionist studies, examining isolated lipid species or simplified model systems like liposomes. For instance, pioneering work by Simons and Ikonen (1997) introduced the lipid raft hypothesis, positing that these domains act as platforms for signaling molecules. Subsequent studies using fluorescence microscopy and biophysical assays have confirmed their existence and functional importance in processes like T-cell activation and viral budding (Lingwood and Simons, 2010).

Despite these advances, several long-standing puzzles remain unresolved. One major gap is understanding the molecular interactions that drive the self-organization of lipids into rafts and phase-separated domains. While cholesterol-sphingolipid interactions are known to promote raft formation, the roles of polyunsaturated fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and minor lipid species in modulating phase behavior are less clear. In metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, altered lipid compositions lead to dysregulated membrane fluidity, contributing to insulin resistance and inflammation (Holzer et al., 2011). Yet, integrative analyses linking lipidomics data to emergent membrane architectures across health and disease states are scarce. Existing literature often relies on small-scale datasets or simulations that do not capture the full complexity of cellular environments. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have modeled lipid bilayers (Marrink et al., 2007), but these are typically limited to predefined compositions and lack the breadth of real-world variability found in public datasets.

Another limitation is the siloed nature of research in this area. Lipid biochemists focus on metabolic pathways, biophysicists on physical properties, and computational chemists on modeling, but rarely do these disciplines converge on large-scale data synthesis. This fragmentation hinders the discovery of emergent phenomena, such as how lipid diversity influences membrane adaptability in response to environmental stresses or pathogens. Recent reviews highlight the need for data-driven approaches to unravel these complexities (Harayama and Riezman, 2018). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the relevance of lipid membranes in viral entry, with SARS-CoV-2 exploiting raft-like domains for host cell invasion (Baggen et al., 2021), yet comprehensive syntheses of lipidomics data related to viral interactions are lacking.

This research is timely and important because it addresses the call for community-scale synthesis projects that leverage publicly available data to tackle fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences. By integrating diverse lipidomics datasets, we can uncover patterns of emergence that individual labs cannot achieve due to resource and expertise constraints. The project's emphasis on lipid-specific dynamics differentiates it from broader studies on biomolecular condensates or metabolic networks, focusing instead on membrane-centric emergence. This is particularly relevant in the era of big data and AI, where synthesis can reveal novel insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. For instance, understanding emergent lipid architectures could inform the design of membrane-targeted drugs for metabolic disorders or antiviral therapies.

Furthermore, the project's collaborative framework promotes inclusivity, drawing talent from developing countries and early-career researchers, thereby tapping diverse perspectives and training the next generation in data-savvy science. This aligns with global efforts to advance open science and reproducibility, ensuring that findings contribute to the broader scientific community. In summary, this synthesis effort fills critical gaps by providing a holistic view of lipid-driven emergence, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of cellular function and dysfunction. It is poised to solve puzzles like the variability in raft formation across cell types and conditions, offering a foundation for innovative applications in biotechnology and medicine.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is guided by a set of specific, interrelated research questions aimed at elucidating the emergent properties of lipid membranes through the integration of public lipidomics data. These questions are designed to be addressed collaboratively, leveraging diverse expertise to synthesize heterogeneous datasets and model complex interactions. The core focus is on how lipid compositions give rise to self-organized domains that influence cellular processes, with an emphasis on health and metabolic diseases.

The primary research question is: What molecular interactions drive the emergence of lipid rafts and phase separations in cellular membranes, and how do these structures modulate membrane fluidity and function across different cell types and pathological conditions? This question breaks down into three sub-questions: (1) How do specific lipid classes, such as cholesterol, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids, interact to form stable raft domains, and what role do minor lipids play in stabilizing or disrupting these structures? (2) In the context of metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, how do alterations in lipid profiles lead to changes in phase separation behavior, and what are the downstream effects on signaling pathways and transport mechanisms? (3) Can emergent membrane architectures be predicted from high-dimensional lipidomics data, and how do these predictions vary under stressors such as viral infection or environmental changes?

To address these questions, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Cholesterol-sphingolipid interactions are the primary drivers of lipid raft emergence, but polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) act as modulators that enhance phase separation in healthy cells while disrupting it in metabolic diseases. Prediction: Integrated datasets will show positive correlations between cholesterol/PUFA ratios and raft stability in normal conditions, with inverted correlations in disease states, validated through clustering analyses revealing distinct lipid clusters.

Hypothesis 2: Emergent phase separations in membranes increase fluidity in response to metabolic stress, facilitating adaptive signaling but contributing to pathology when dysregulated. Prediction: In datasets from diabetic models, phase-separated domains will correlate with elevated expression of fluidity markers (e.g., via simulated membrane curvature metrics), leading to enhanced transport protein localization, testable by comparing lipid profiles pre- and post-stress induction in public repositories.

Hypothesis 3: AI-driven models trained on synthesized lipidomics data can predict emergent domain formations with high accuracy, revealing novel lipid interactions critical for viral entry. Prediction: Machine learning algorithms will achieve >80% accuracy in classifying raft-prone lipid compositions, identifying underrepresented lipids (e.g., ceramides) as key players in viral membrane fusion, confirmed by cross-validation against independent datasets.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive database of integrated lipid profiles, annotated with emergent properties; novel analytical tools such as a unified lipid ontology and AI prediction pipelines; and peer-reviewed publications detailing the findings. Deliverables will encompass open-access repositories on Zenodo with standardized datasets, simulation results, and reproducible workflows. These will advance methodological developments in synthesis research, providing templates for future data integration in cellular sciences.

Hypotheses will be tested through a multi-step validation process. First, data integration will harmonize lipid nomenclatures across sources, followed by statistical clustering to identify emergent patterns. MD simulations will model hypothesized interactions, with outputs compared to empirical data for validation. Cross-validation will use hold-out datasets to assess prediction accuracy, ensuring robustness. Statistical methods, including multivariate regression and network analysis, will quantify interaction strengths and test predictions. If hypotheses are supported, outcomes will reveal mechanistic insights into membrane emergence; if not, they will refine models by identifying alternative drivers. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with built-in controls for data heterogeneity and biases. Overall, these questions and hypotheses position the project to generate deeper insights into lipid-driven emergence, fostering transdisciplinary collaboration and training opportunities for trainees in data synthesis and open science practices.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on existing publicly available data, with no generation of new experimental data, aligning with the research call's emphasis on community-scale integration. We will leverage datasets from three primary sources: LIPID MAPS, which provides comprehensive lipid structure and pathway information with over 40,000 annotated lipids; Metabolomics Workbench, hosting thousands of metabolomics studies including lipid profiles from human, animal, and cell models under various conditions (e.g., disease states); and MassIVE, a repository for mass spectrometry data with raw and processed lipidomics datasets from diverse biological contexts. Specific datasets include those from studies on metabolic diseases (e.g., NIH-funded lipidomics of diabetic tissues) and viral infections (e.g., lipid changes in COVID-19 infected cells), ensuring coverage of health, disease, and stress conditions across cell types like hepatocytes, adipocytes, and immune cells.

Analytical methods will integrate computational and biophysical approaches. First, data standardization will involve developing a unified lipid ontology using semantic web technologies (e.g., OWL ontologies) to harmonize nomenclature inconsistencies across repositories. This will be achieved through collaborative workshops, where team members map lipid identifiers and metadata, creating a standardized schema for integration. High-dimensional lipid profiles will then be synthesized using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines in Python with libraries like Pandas and RDFlib, resulting in a centralized database of over 100,000 lipid entries.

To model emergent behaviors, we will employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS software on coarse-grained models (e.g., Martini force field) to simulate lipid bilayers based on integrated compositions. Simulations will run for 1-10 μs virtual time, capturing phase separations and raft formations by tracking parameters like order parameters, lateral diffusion rates, and cluster sizes. Clustering algorithms, including hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN in scikit-learn, will analyze simulation outputs and empirical data to identify emergent domains, with dimensionality reduction via PCA or t-SNE for visualization.

AI-driven predictions will utilize machine learning models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) in PyTorch Geometric, trained on lipid interaction graphs derived from the ontology. These models will predict domain formations, with features including lipid headgroup polarity, chain length, and saturation. Training data will be split 70/20/10 for train/validation/test, incorporating cross-dataset validation to handle heterogeneity.

The experimental design is computational, with 'controls' simulated as baseline lipid mixtures (e.g., pure POPC bilayers) compared to complex mixtures. Replicates will involve multiple simulation runs (n=5-10) with randomized initial conditions to assess variability, ensuring statistical power. Timeline spans 36 months: Months 1-6 for data curation and ontology development (milestone: standardized database); Months 7-18 for MD simulations and clustering (milestone: initial models of raft emergence); Months 19-30 for AI model training and validation (milestone: predictive tools); Months 31-36 for synthesis of findings and dissemination (milestone: open repositories and manuscripts).

Statistical analysis plans include ANOVA for comparing domain metrics across conditions, correlation analyses (Pearson/Spearman) for lipid interactions, and ROC curves for AI model performance. False discovery rates will be controlled using Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests. Bias mitigation will involve stratified sampling from datasets to balance representation of cell types and conditions.

Collaboration is integral, with the working group comprising 8-10 members: lipid biochemists from the US and Brazil, biophysicists from Europe, and computational chemists from India and early-career researchers. NCEMS resources will support virtual platforms (e.g., Slack, Jupyter Hub) for real-time collaboration, workshops (2-3 annually), and trainee involvement (4-6 graduate students/postdocs) in virtual labs focusing on data analysis and open science. This transdisciplinary approach exceeds single-lab capabilities, requiring diverse expertise for handling data scale and complexity. All workflows will adhere to open science principles, with code on GitHub and data on Zenodo. (Word count: 852)

Ion homeostasis is a fundamental process in cellular biology, ensuring the maintenance of stable electrochemical gradients across membranes, which are crucial for cellular functions such as signaling, excitability, and metabolism. In eukaryotic cells, ions like sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl-) are tightly regulated through a network of ion channels, transporters, and pumps distributed across various cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nucleus. Disruptions in ion homeostasis can lead to severe pathologies, including neurological disorders like epilepsy and cardiovascular conditions such as arrhythmias. Despite decades of research, the emergent properties arising from the coordination of these ion-handling mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly how localized ion fluxes in subcellular compartments contribute to global cellular behaviors.

The current state of the field has been shaped by advances in electrophysiology and proteomics. Electrophysiological techniques, such as patch-clamp recordings, have provided detailed insights into single-channel behaviors and whole-cell currents, revealing the kinetic properties of ion channels in response to voltage, ligands, and mechanical stimuli. Public repositories like IonChannelGenealogy aggregate electrophysiological data from diverse species and cell types, offering a wealth of time-series recordings that capture ion channel dynamics. Similarly, proteomic databases such as ProteomeXchange and the Allen Brain Atlas provide high-throughput quantitative data on protein expression, localization, and interactions, enabling the mapping of ion channel proteomes in specific cellular contexts. For instance, studies using mass spectrometry have identified compartment-specific expression patterns of voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g., Kv1 family) in neuronal dendrites versus somata, highlighting spatial heterogeneity.

Key literature underscores the complexity of ion homeostasis. Hodgkin and Huxley's seminal 1952 model described action potentials in squid axons through differential equations governing Na+ and K+ conductances, laying the foundation for computational electrophysiology. More recent works, such as those by Cannon et al. (2010) in Nature Neuroscience, have extended this to compartmental models in neurons, simulating how ion channels in axons and dendrites interact to generate propagating signals. In cardiac cells, research by Bers (2002) in Annual Review of Physiology emphasized Ca2+ handling between sarcoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, linking local fluxes to global contractility. Proteomic studies, like those from the Human Protein Atlas, have cataloged ion channel expression in tissues, revealing correlations with disease states; for example, mutations in SCN5A (Na+ channel) are associated with Brugada syndrome, disrupting cardiac excitability.

However, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on isolated channels or single compartments, neglecting emergent phenomena where interactions across compartments produce novel properties not predictable from individual components. For example, while we know that mitochondrial K+ channels influence cytosolic Ca2+ waves (as reviewed by Szabo and Zoratti, 2014, in Physiological Reviews), the synthesis of electrophysiological and proteomic data to model how these contribute to whole-cell homeostasis is lacking. Long-standing puzzles include the origins of cardiac arrhythmias, where stochastic ion channel openings in subcellular domains may trigger emergent oscillatory behaviors leading to fibrillation, as hypothesized in models by Qu et al. (2011) in Biophysical Journal. In neurons, the fidelity of synaptic signaling relies on coordinated ion fluxes across pre- and post-synaptic compartments, yet integrative analyses of public datasets have not fully elucidated how proteomic variations influence electrophysiological outcomes.

Limitations in current knowledge stem from the siloed nature of data generation: electrophysiologists often work with temporal recordings without proteomic context, while proteomic studies lack dynamic functional data. Individual labs struggle with the scale of integrating these datasets, which involve terabytes of heterogeneous information requiring advanced computational tools for harmonization. Moreover, traditional approaches overlook transdisciplinary insights, such as applying dynamical systems theory from physics to biological oscillations.

This research is important and timely because it addresses the NCEMS call for synthesizing publicly available data to tackle emergence in molecular and cellular biosciences. With the explosion of open-access repositories post-2010, including mandates from funding agencies like NIH for data sharing, there is an unprecedented opportunity to integrate electrophysiological and proteomic datasets. This synthesis can resolve enigmas like the emergent stability of resting membrane potentials despite fluctuating ion channel expressions, potentially informing therapies for ion channelopathies. In neurons, understanding how localized Ca2+ sparks in spines lead to global plasticity could advance treatments for Alzheimer's. In cardiac cells, modeling emergent arrhythmias from ion imbalances could predict drug-induced proarrhythmic risks, aligning with FDA initiatives on computational cardiology.

The timeliness is underscored by recent global health challenges, such as COVID-19's impact on cardiac ion homeostasis, and the rise of big data analytics in biology. By fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, this project will tap diverse talent, train data-savvy researchers, and promote open science, ultimately advancing fundamental questions in cellular excitability and homeostasis.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This proposal aims to address fundamental questions about emergent ion homeostasis through the synthesis of existing electrophysiological and proteomic data, focusing on neuronal and cardiac cells. The research questions are designed to be specific, novel, and aligned with the NCEMS emphasis on emergence phenomena, where localized ion activities give rise to global cellular properties. By integrating diverse datasets, we seek to uncover mechanisms that individual studies have not resolved, such as the coordination of ion channels across compartments leading to stable electrical potentials and signaling fidelity.

The primary research question is: How do ion channel activities in distinct cellular compartments interact to produce emergent homeostatic states that maintain global cellular excitability? This question targets the core emergence puzzle: why do cells exhibit robust electrical behaviors despite variability in ion channel expression and localization? Sub-questions include: (1) In neuronal cells, how do proteomic profiles of ion channels in dendritic spines versus somata contribute to emergent synaptic signaling fidelity? (2) In cardiac myocytes, what role do mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic reticulum ion transporters play in generating emergent oscillatory patterns that underlie arrhythmogenic risks? (3) Across both cell types, can time-series electrophysiological data be synthesized with proteomic data to predict tipping points where localized ion fluxes lead to global instability, such as epileptic seizures or cardiac fibrillation?

To address these, we propose testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Emergent ion homeostasis arises from nonlinear interactions between compartmental ion channels, where proteomic abundance in one compartment (e.g., high Kv channel expression in neuronal axons) compensates for electrophysiological variability in another (e.g., Na+ channel fluctuations in somata), predicting stable resting potentials across diverse datasets. This will be tested by correlating proteomic expression levels from ProteomeXchange with electrophysiological stability metrics from IonChannelGenealogy, expecting that cells with balanced compartmental proteomes show lower variance in membrane potential time-series.

Hypothesis 2: In cardiac cells, localized Ca2+ fluxes in mitochondria lead to emergent global oscillations via feedback loops with plasma membrane channels, hypothesizing that proteomic upregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporters (e.g., MCU) correlates with increased arrhythmogenic susceptibility in disease datasets. Predictions include higher oscillation frequencies in synthesized models when MCU expression exceeds a threshold, validated against Allen Brain Atlas data for cardiac tissues and electrophysiological recordings from arrhythmia models.

Hypothesis 3: Cross-compartmental ion coordination exhibits bifurcation points, where small proteomic perturbations (e.g., 20% change in Cl- channel expression) trigger emergent shifts from stable to chaotic states, predicting disease onset. This draws from dynamical systems theory, expecting bifurcations in modeled ion flux trajectories when integrating temporal data, with outcomes like increased entropy in electrophysiological signals for diseased versus healthy cells.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive database of harmonized ion profiles, predictive models of emergent homeostasis, and analytical frameworks for identifying ion-driven states. Deliverables encompass: (1) Open-source software for data integration and modeling, (2) Peer-reviewed publications detailing emergent mechanisms, (3) Validated hypotheses through computational simulations benchmarked against independent datasets, and (4) Training modules for trainees on synthesis methods.

Hypotheses will be tested via a structured validation pipeline. First, data synthesis will create unified datasets, followed by circuit modeling to simulate ion interactions. Validation involves cross-validation with held-out data subsets, where model predictions are compared to observed electrophysiological outcomes using metrics like root-mean-square error for potential stability and spectral analysis for oscillations. Statistical rigor will employ Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty in predictions, ensuring hypotheses are falsifiable. For instance, if no correlation is found between compartmental proteomes and stability, Hypothesis 1 would be rejected, prompting refinement. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with expected insights resolving long-standing puzzles like the robustness of neuronal firing despite proteomic noise, and the stochastic origins of arrhythmias. By focusing on emergence distinct from simple signaling, this work will advance molecular biosciences through collaborative, data-driven discovery. (678 words)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize publicly available data, integrating electrophysiological recordings and proteomic datasets to model emergent ion homeostasis without generating new experimental data. The approach emphasizes transdisciplinary collaboration among electrophysiologists, systems biologists, and data scientists from labs in North America, Europe, and Asia, leveraging diverse expertise for computational integration beyond single-lab capabilities.

Data sources include: (1) IonChannelGenealogy, providing over 10,000 electrophysiological time-series recordings of ion channel currents (e.g., voltage-clamp data for Na+, K+, Ca2+ channels in neurons and cardiomyocytes); (2) ProteomeXchange (via PRIDE repository), offering quantitative proteomic profiles from mass spectrometry, including subcellular localization data for ion-handling proteins in various cell types; (3) Allen Brain Atlas, supplying spatially resolved proteomic and transcriptomic data for neuronal compartments, with extensions to cardiac tissues through linked datasets like GTEx. Additional repositories such as BioGRID for protein interactions and GEO for disease-specific electrophysiological profiles (e.g., arrhythmia models) will supplement, ensuring comprehensive coverage of neuronal (e.g., hippocampal neurons) and cardiac (e.g., ventricular myocytes) systems. All data are open-access, with metadata standardized using ontologies like Gene Ontology for ion transport terms.

Analytical methods will involve a multi-step pipeline. First, data harmonization: We will use Python-based tools (e.g., Pandas, SciPy) to normalize heterogeneous datasets. Electrophysiological recordings will be preprocessed for noise reduction via wavelet transforms, aligning time-series with proteomic abundance via common identifiers (e.g., UniProt IDs). For compartmental specificity, we will employ spatial mapping algorithms to assign proteomic data to subcellular domains (e.g., dendrites vs. mitochondria) using machine learning classifiers trained on Allen Atlas annotations.

Core computational approaches include circuit modeling and time-series analysis. We will adapt Hodgkin-Huxley-style models to multi-compartmental frameworks using NEURON software, incorporating proteomic data as parameters for channel densities (e.g., g_Na = f(protein expression)). Dynamical systems theory will model emergence via ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing ion fluxes: d[V]/dt = - (I_Na + I_K + I_Ca + I_leak)/C_m, extended to coupled compartments with feedback terms. Time-series analysis will use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and phase-plane analysis to detect emergent oscillations, identifying bifurcations (e.g., Hopf bifurcations) where localized fluxes lead to global instability.

To predict ion-driven states, we will integrate machine learning: Graph neural networks (GNNs) will represent compartmental interactions as nodes (compartments) and edges (ion fluxes), trained on synthesized data to forecast excitability outcomes. For disease testing, models will be applied to datasets from arrhythmia cohorts (e.g., UK Biobank electrophysiological variants), comparing predicted vs. observed states.

Although no new experiments are generated, the 'experimental design' analog is in silico validation with controls: Synthetic datasets generated from baseline models will serve as controls, with 'replicates' via bootstrapping (n=1000 iterations) to assess robustness. Sensitivity analyses will vary proteomic inputs by ±10-20% to test hypothesis predictions, using controls where variations are randomized.

The timeline spans 36 months: Months 1-6: Team assembly, data curation, and harmonization (Milestone: Integrated database on GitHub). Months 7-18: Model development and initial simulations (Milestone: Preliminary models for neuronal homeostasis, validated on 20% held-out data). Months 19-30: Application to cardiac systems and disease datasets (Milestone: Predictive frameworks for arrhythmias, with cross-validation accuracy >80%). Months 31-36: Refinement, trainee-led analyses, and dissemination (Milestone: Final open-source toolkit and manuscripts).

Statistical analysis plans include non-parametric tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov) for comparing distributions of modeled vs. empirical potentials, and ANOVA for assessing compartmental effects on oscillations. Bayesian hierarchical models will incorporate uncertainty in proteomic quantifications, with priors from literature (e.g., channel conductance variances). Power analyses will ensure sufficient dataset sizes (target n>500 per cell type) for detecting effects with alpha=0.05 and power=0.9. All workflows will be reproducible via Jupyter notebooks, adhering to open science principles. This rigorous, collaborative approach will yield innovative strategies for synthesizing temporal and proteomic data, addressing NCEMS goals. (852 words)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The expected outcomes of this project will significantly advance the understanding of emergent ion homeostasis, providing novel insights into how compartmental ion dynamics coordinate to maintain cellular excitability. Key contributions include a unified framework for predicting global electrical states from localized ion fluxes, resolving puzzles such as the stochastic emergence of arrhythmias from mitochondrial Ca2+ mishandling or neuronal hyperexcitability in epilepsy. Deliverables will encompass an open-access database of harmonized electrophysiological and proteomic data, predictive computational models (e.g., multi-compartmental ODE systems), and analytical tools for detecting emergence bifurcations, all hosted on GitHub with DOI-linked repositories for reproducibility.

Intended contributions to the field are multifaceted. In molecular biology, this synthesis will bridge gaps between static proteomic snapshots and dynamic electrophysiological behaviors, offering a transdisciplinary lens on emergence phenomena distinct from traditional signaling studies. For instance, by quantifying how proteomic variability in ion channels leads to robust homeostasis, we will provide mechanistic explanations for cellular resilience, informing models of ion channelopathies. In cellular biosciences, the project will innovate research strategies, such as GNN-based integration of heterogeneous data, setting precedents for future synthesis efforts.

Broader impacts extend to biomedical applications. Insights into cardiac arrhythmia origins could enhance in silico drug screening, reducing reliance on animal models and aligning with 3Rs principles. For neurology, predicting synaptic fidelity from compartmental ion profiles may aid in designing therapies for disorders like schizophrenia, where ion imbalances disrupt signaling. Societally, by training a diverse cohort of trainees (graduate students and postdocs) in data synthesis, the project will build a data-savvy workforce, promoting inclusivity across career stages, geographies, and institutions (e.g., involving HBCUs and international partners).

Potential for follow-up research is substantial. Validated models could be extended to other cell types (e.g., immune cells) or integrated with emerging datasets like single-cell proteomics, fostering new collaborations. We anticipate spin-off projects, such as applying these frameworks to environmental stressors on ion homeostasis, supported by NCEMS networks.

Dissemination plans include publishing in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature Communications for main findings, PLOS Computational Biology for methods), with preprints on bioRxiv for rapid sharing. We will present at conferences like Biophysical Society meetings and organize webinars on synthesis techniques. All outputs—data, code, and workflows—will adhere to FAIR principles, deposited in repositories like Zenodo. Publication strategy emphasizes open access, with team co-authorship reflecting contributions, including trainees as lead authors on sub-studies.

The long-term vision is to establish a sustainable paradigm for community-scale synthesis in biosciences, where emergent phenomena are routinely explored through collaborative data integration. This could lead to a consortium for ion homeostasis research, sustaining impacts beyond the project via shared resources and ongoing training programs. By catalyzing multidisciplinary teams and open science, this work will enduringly transform how we address fundamental questions in molecular and cellular sciences, ultimately benefiting health and education globally.

Circadian rhythms are fundamental biological processes that regulate daily cycles in physiology, behavior, and metabolism across nearly all living organisms. At the molecular level, these rhythms are driven by a network of clock genes and proteins that form feedback loops, generating oscillations with approximately 24-hour periods. The core molecular clock in mammals, for instance, involves genes such as PERIOD (PER), CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), CLOCK, and BMAL1, which interact to create self-sustaining oscillations. These molecular interactions are inherently noisy due to stochastic gene expression, thermal fluctuations, and environmental perturbations, yet they emerge into coherent, synchronized rhythms that coordinate cellular functions like metabolism and stress responses.

The concept of emergence in biological systems refers to how complex, organized behaviors arise from simpler, often chaotic interactions among components. In the context of circadian biology, emergent synchronization describes how individual molecular oscillators, each prone to desynchronization, align to produce robust, population-level rhythms. This phenomenon is crucial for cellular homeostasis; disruptions in clock synchronization are linked to diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions. For example, shift work and jet lag, which desynchronize clocks, increase risks of diabetes and cardiovascular issues, highlighting the clinical relevance of understanding clock emergence.

Current research in circadian biology has made significant strides through experimental approaches. Landmark studies, such as those by Takahashi and colleagues (e.g., Reppert and Weaver, 2002, in Annual Review of Physiology), have elucidated the genetic basis of the mammalian clock, identifying key transcription-translation feedback loops. High-throughput techniques like RNA sequencing have generated vast datasets, revealing genome-wide rhythmic expression patterns. Repositories such as CircaDB (Pizarro et al., 2013, Nucleic Acids Research) compile time-course transcriptomic data from various tissues and species, while metabolomic databases like the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) provide insights into rhythmic metabolite fluctuations.

Despite these advances, the field faces key limitations. Most studies focus on isolated components or steady-state behaviors rather than the dynamic emergence of synchronization from noisy interactions. For instance, mathematical models like those by Goldbeter (1995, Proceedings of the Royal Society B) simulate single-oscillator dynamics but often overlook network-level synchronization in heterogeneous populations. Empirical work, such as single-cell imaging by Welsh et al. (2010, Annual Review of Physiology), demonstrates variability in oscillator phases, yet integrating these with large-scale omics data to model emergence remains underexplored. Existing syntheses, like meta-analyses of circadian transcriptomes (e.g., Hughes et al., 2017, Journal of Biological Rhythms), emphasize metabolic outputs but neglect temporal alignment mechanisms.

A major gap is the lack of transdisciplinary approaches to quantify how noisy molecular interactions coalesce into coherent timing. Traditional lab-based research struggles with the scale of data integration required; individual labs may analyze subsets of data but cannot synthesize diverse datasets (e.g., combining transcriptomics from CircaDB with metabolomics from MetaboLights) to model emergence holistically. This is compounded by methodological silos: chronobiologists provide biological insights, but mathematicians and bioinformaticians are needed for advanced modeling like phase-locking and network synchronization algorithms.

This research is timely due to the explosion of publicly available data and computational tools. The advent of big data in biology, with repositories amassing petabytes of time-series data, enables synthesis projects that were previously infeasible. Moreover, emerging paradigms in systems biology emphasize emergence, aligning with funding priorities for multidisciplinary synthesis. Addressing clock synchronization could resolve long-standing puzzles, such as why certain cells maintain rhythmicity under stress while others falter, with implications for chronotherapy in cancer treatment (e.g., timing drug delivery to exploit clock vulnerabilities).

The importance extends beyond academia. Disruptions in circadian synchronization contribute to societal burdens like sleep disorders affecting 50-70 million Americans annually (CDC data). By synthesizing data to uncover emergent mechanisms, this project could inform interventions for jet lag, aging-related clock decline, and metabolic diseases. It also fosters training in data synthesis, preparing a workforce for future challenges in molecular biosciences. Unlike prior focuses on epigenomics or metabolism, our emphasis on temporal emergence offers novel insights, bridging molecular details with cellular outcomes.

In summary, while the field has mapped circadian components, the emergent synchronization from noisy interactions remains a puzzle. This synthesis project, leveraging public data and diverse expertise, is poised to fill these gaps, advancing molecular and cellular sciences through innovative, collaborative strategies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing publicly available data to explore emergent synchronization in circadian molecular clocks. We focus on how individual, noisy oscillator genes align to form robust, coherent rhythms that regulate cellular processes. The overarching question is: How do inherently stochastic molecular interactions within circadian networks emerge into synchronized, population-level timing that governs metabolism and stress responses?

To dissect this, we pose three specific research questions (RQs), each with associated testable hypotheses, predictions, and validation strategies. These are designed to be addressed through data synthesis, without generating new experimental data, and require multidisciplinary collaboration.

RQ1: What are the key molecular interactions and network topologies that facilitate phase synchronization among oscillator genes in noisy cellular environments? This question targets the structural and dynamic bases of emergence, building on observations that clock genes form interconnected loops but vary in coupling strength across cell types.

Hypothesis 1.1: Stronger coupling between core clock genes (e.g., PER-CRY feedback to CLOCK-BMAL1) enhances phase-locking, reducing desynchronization in high-noise conditions, as measured by lower phase variance in simulated networks.
Prediction: In synthesized datasets from diverse tissues (e.g., liver vs. brain), networks with higher connectivity density will show faster convergence to synchronized states, quantifiable via Kuramoto order parameters exceeding 0.8 within 48 simulated hours.
Hypothesis 1.2: Heterogeneous oscillator frequencies, reflecting cellular variability, lead to emergent clusters of synchronized subgroups, rather than global alignment, unless external zeitgebers (e.g., simulated light cues) are integrated.
Prediction: Cluster analysis on phase data will reveal 2-5 distinct phase groups in unsynchronized models, reducing to 1 with zeitgeber inclusion, validated against empirical phase distributions in CircaDB.
Expected outcomes: A comprehensive network model of clock topologies, identifying critical nodes for synchronization. Deliverables include open-source network graphs and synchronization metrics.

Testing and validation: Hypotheses will be tested using phase-locking models (e.g., Kuramoto oscillators) applied to integrated transcriptomic time-series data. Validation involves cross-dataset comparisons (e.g., mouse vs. human clocks) and sensitivity analyses to noise levels, ensuring robustness.

RQ2: How does emergent synchronization influence downstream cellular processes, such as metabolic flux and stress response pathways? This extends emergence from clocks to functional outputs, addressing gaps in linking temporal alignment to cellular physiology.

Hypothesis 2.1: Synchronized clocks amplify rhythmic expression in metabolic genes (e.g., those in glycolysis), leading to higher amplitude oscillations in metabolite levels compared to desynchronized states.
Prediction: Entropy-based metrics will show lower disorder (entropy < 2 bits) in synchronized simulations, correlating with 20-30% increased amplitude in pathways like PPAR signaling, as derived from metabolomic data.
Hypothesis 2.2: Desynchronization increases vulnerability to stress, manifesting as damped rhythms in stress-response genes (e.g., HSP family), which can be mitigated by enhancing network robustness through simulated interventions.
Prediction: Predictive simulations will demonstrate that increasing coupling strength restores rhythm amplitude by 50% under stress perturbations, matching patterns in public datasets from stressed cells.

RQ3: Can novel analytical strategies, such as entropy-based emergence detection, predict synchronization failures in pathological conditions? This methodological question aims to develop tools for broader application in emergence studies.

Hypothesis 3.1: Entropy metrics applied to time-series data will accurately detect transitions from noisy to synchronized states, with thresholds (e.g., entropy drop > 1 bit) predicting robustness in healthy vs. diseased models.
Prediction: In cancer cell data, higher baseline entropy will correlate with observed desynchronization, with 80% accuracy in classifying states via machine learning classifiers.
Hypothesis 3.2: Predictive simulations incorporating these metrics will forecast resynchronization strategies, such as targeted gene perturbations, improving rhythm coherence by at least 40% in models of clock disorders.
Prediction: Simulations will identify optimal intervention points, validated by retrospective analysis of public intervention studies.
Expected outcomes: Innovative metrics and algorithms for emergence detection, applicable beyond circadian biology. Deliverables: Open protocols and software packages.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available data, integrating diverse datasets to model emergent synchronization in molecular clocks. No new experimental data will be generated, aligning with the research call's emphasis on community-scale synthesis. The approach requires collaboration among chronobiologists, mathematicians, and bioinformaticians from multiple institutions, necessitating NCEMS support for data integration platforms and workshops.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary data will be sourced from the Circadian Expression Profiles Data Base (CircaDB), which hosts over 100 time-course transcriptomic datasets from mammals, including high-resolution RNA-seq from liver, brain, and fibroblast cells under various conditions (e.g., normal, stressed, or light-entrained). We will integrate this with metabolomic data from repositories like MetaboLights (EMBL-EBI) and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), providing rhythmic profiles of metabolites such as NAD+ and melatonin. Additional sources include GEO (NCBI) for single-cell RNA-seq datasets (e.g., GSE datasets on circadian gene expression in heterogeneous populations) and the BioCyc database for pathway annotations. Datasets will be selected based on criteria: time resolution (at least 2-hour intervals over 48+ hours), public accessibility, and relevance to noisy or desynchronized states (e.g., data from clock gene knockouts). We anticipate synthesizing ~50 datasets, totaling >10,000 time points, to capture variability across species, tissues, and perturbations.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: The core methodology involves phase-locking models and network synchronization algorithms to simulate emergence. We will construct gene regulatory networks using tools like ARACNe (for inferring interactions from expression data) and model dynamics with Kuramoto oscillators, where each node represents a clock gene with phase θ_i evolving as dθ_i/dt = ω_i + Σ K_{ij} sin(θ_j - θ_i), incorporating noise via stochastic terms. Synchronization will be quantified using the Kuramoto order parameter R = |Σ e^{iθ_j}| / N, with R>0.7 indicating coherence.

Innovations include entropy-based metrics for emergence detection: We will compute Shannon entropy on phase distributions (H = -Σ p(θ) log p(θ)) to detect transitions from high-entropy (noisy) to low-entropy (synchronized) states. Predictive simulations will use agent-based modeling in NetLogo or Python (with libraries like NetworkX and SciPy) to forecast synchronization under perturbations. For integration, we will develop a custom pipeline in R/Bioconductor: (1) Data harmonization via normalization (e.g., DESeq2 for transcriptomics, MetaboAnalyst for metabolomics); (2) Time-series alignment using dynamic time warping; (3) Multiscale analysis combining molecular (gene-level) and cellular (pathway-level) data.

To ensure rigor, we will employ machine learning for pattern detection, such as random forests to classify synchronization states based on entropy features, trained on subsets of data and validated on hold-out sets.

Experimental Design: Though no new experiments, the design mimics in silico experiments with controls. 'Control' conditions will use baseline datasets (e.g., wild-type clocks), while 'treatment' simulations introduce noise or perturbations (e.g., random phase shifts). Replicates will involve bootstrapping (n=1000) across dataset subsets to assess variability. Sensitivity analyses will test parameters like coupling strength (K from 0.1 to 1.0) and noise levels (σ from 0 to 0.5).

Timeline and Milestones: The project spans 36 months.
- Months 1-6: Team assembly, data curation, and platform setup (Milestone: Integrated database with 20+ datasets; Deliverable: Shared repository on GitHub).
- Months 7-12: Network construction and phase-locking modeling (Milestone: Initial synchronization models; Deliverable: Preliminary report on RQ1 hypotheses).
- Months 13-18: Entropy metric development and metabolic-stress integrations (Milestone: Validated entropy tools; Deliverable: Software package for emergence detection).
- Months 19-24: Predictive simulations and cross-validation (Milestone: Full model simulations; Deliverable: Manuscripts on RQ2 and RQ3).
- Months 25-30: Trainee-led analyses and workshops (Milestone: Training modules; Deliverable: Open workshops and trainee publications).
- Months 31-36: Synthesis of findings, dissemination (Milestone: Final models; Deliverable: Comprehensive data portal and peer-reviewed papers).

Statistical Analysis Plans: For hypothesis testing, we will use non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum for comparing entropy in synchronized vs. desynchronized states) and ANOVA for multi-group comparisons (e.g., across tissues). Correlation analyses (Spearman's rho) will link synchronization metrics to metabolic outcomes. Multiple testing correction via Benjamini-Hochberg will control false discovery rates (<0.05). Power analyses, based on pilot simulations, ensure 80% power to detect effect sizes >0.5. All analyses will be reproducible via Jupyter notebooks.

This approach leverages diverse expertise, promotes open science (e.g., FAIR principles for data sharing), and includes trainee involvement in modeling tasks to build data-savvy skills. NCEMS resources are essential for handling data scale and facilitating inclusive collaborations. (912 words)

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_grok_05,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,grok-4,Emergent Cytoskeletal Self-Organization from Public Imaging and Dynamics Data,"This synthesis integrates public cytoskeletal imaging and kinetics data from sources like Cytodata and PDB to model emergent self-organization in actin and microtubule networks, questioning how monomer interactions lead to dynamic structures supporting cellular motility and division. Differentiating from organelle or protein network ideas, it focuses on mechanical emergence, using agent-based modeling and image analysis AI.

Cytoskeletal experts, physicists, and computer vision specialists collaborate across labs, with NCEMS supporting data fusion and trainee programs. Activities include pattern recognition algorithms and simulations, addressing motility puzzles. Open sharing ensures impact, training future researchers in synthesis.",,"Background And Significance

The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of protein filaments that provides structural support, enables cellular motility, and facilitates intracellular transport and cell division in eukaryotic cells. Comprising actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, the cytoskeleton exhibits remarkable self-organization, where simple molecular interactions give rise to complex, emergent structures and behaviors. This emergence is a fundamental phenomenon in molecular and cellular biosciences, aligning with the research call's emphasis on synthesizing publicly available data to address questions about how local rules at the molecular level lead to global patterns at the cellular scale.

Current understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics stems from decades of research. Actin filaments, polymerized from G-actin monomers, form networks that drive processes like lamellipodia formation in cell migration, while microtubules, assembled from tubulin dimers, are crucial for spindle formation during mitosis. Key studies, such as those by Pollard and Borisy (2003) in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, have elucidated the biochemical kinetics of actin polymerization, highlighting roles of nucleation-promoting factors like Arp2/3 and formins. Similarly, Howard's (2001) book 'Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton' integrates biophysical models of microtubule dynamics, including dynamic instability where microtubules undergo rapid growth and catastrophe phases.

Advancements in imaging technologies have generated vast public datasets. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) houses atomic structures of cytoskeletal proteins, such as the actin monomer (PDB ID: 1J6Z) and microtubule protofilaments (PDB ID: 3JAK). The Cytodata repository, part of the Allen Cell Explorer, provides high-resolution imaging of cytoskeletal structures in live cells, including time-lapse microscopy of actin waves and microtubule asters. Kinetics data from sources like the BioNumbers database quantify parameters such as polymerization rates (e.g., actin elongation at 11.6 subunits/s/μM) and treadmilling velocities.

Literature on self-organization includes agent-based models by Camazine et al. (2001) in 'Self-Organization in Biological Systems,' applying concepts to ant colonies but extendable to cytoskeletal networks. In cellular contexts, Mogilner and Oster (1996) in Biophysical Journal modeled actin-based motility using reaction-diffusion equations, demonstrating how monomer diffusion and polymerization create propulsive forces. For microtubules, Nedelec et al. (1997) in Nature simulated aster formation through motor protein-mediated interactions. Recent AI-driven analyses, such as those by Basu et al. (2018) in Cell Systems, use machine learning to classify cytoskeletal patterns from fluorescence images.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on isolated components—e.g., actin or microtubules separately—neglecting their integrated dynamics in vivo. For instance, while individual filament behaviors are well-characterized, the emergent mechanical properties arising from network interactions, such as viscoelasticity enabling cell shape changes, remain poorly understood. Long-standing puzzles include how stochastic monomer additions lead to robust structures like the mitotic spindle, resistant to perturbations, or how actin-microtubule crosstalk facilitates directed motility in asymmetric environments.

Limitations in current knowledge arise from fragmented data silos: imaging datasets often lack kinetic annotations, and structural data from PDB are static, missing dynamic transitions. Traditional lab-based approaches generate new data but are limited in scale, unable to synthesize the breadth of public resources. Synthesis efforts, like the Virtual Cell project, integrate models but rarely incorporate AI for pattern recognition across diverse datasets.

This research is important and timely because understanding cytoskeletal emergence has implications for diseases like cancer, where microtubule-targeting drugs (e.g., taxanes) disrupt division, or neurodegenerative disorders involving actin dysregulation. The explosion of public data—from initiatives like the Human Cell Atlas—provides an unprecedented opportunity for synthesis. Amidst calls for open science, this project aligns with NCEMS goals by fostering multidisciplinary collaboration to tackle these puzzles without generating new data. By integrating physics-based modeling with AI, it addresses mechanical emergence, differentiating from protein interaction networks or organelle assembly, and promises broader insights into biological self-organization. Timeliness is underscored by recent advancements in computational power and AI, enabling large-scale data fusion previously infeasible for single labs. Ultimately, this work will advance molecular and cellular sciences by revealing principles of emergence that could inspire synthetic biology and biomaterials design. (712 words)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses fundamental questions about emergent self-organization in cytoskeletal networks, focusing on how molecular-level interactions in actin and microtubule systems give rise to dynamic, mechanical structures essential for cellular motility and division. By integrating publicly available imaging and kinetics data, we aim to uncover novel insights into these processes through a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach involving cytoskeletal biologists, physicists, and computer vision experts.

The primary research question is: How do local interactions among cytoskeletal monomers and associated proteins lead to the emergent self-organization of actin and microtubule networks that support robust cellular motility and division? This question is subdivided into specific, detailed sub-questions to ensure focus and testability.

Sub-question 1: What are the key kinetic parameters and spatial patterns in public datasets that drive the transition from monomeric subunits to organized filamentous networks in actin systems? We hypothesize that nucleation rates and branching frequencies, derived from Cytodata imaging and BioNumbers kinetics, will reveal thresholds where random monomer additions shift to patterned structures like lamellipodia. Predictions include that above a critical Arp2/3 concentration (e.g., 0.1 μM), branching dominates, leading to dendritic networks with measurable fractal dimensions (>1.5) in image analyses.

Sub-question 2: How do microtubule dynamics, including growth and catastrophe rates, contribute to the self-organization of asters and spindles during cell division? Our hypothesis posits that dynamic instability parameters from PDB structures and time-lapse data will show that motor protein crosslinking (e.g., kinesin-5) stabilizes asters, with catastrophe frequencies decreasing by 20-30% in crowded environments. We predict that simulations will demonstrate emergent bipolar spindle formation only when tubulin dimer concentrations exceed 10 μM, validated against experimental snapshots in public repositories.

Sub-question 3: In what ways does mechanical crosstalk between actin and microtubule networks enhance emergent behaviors in motility and division? We hypothesize that integrated networks exhibit amplified viscoelastic properties, where actin contractility modulates microtubule buckling. Predictions include that agent-based models incorporating force-balance equations will show a 15-25% increase in motility speed when actin-microtubule linkers (e.g., spectraplakin) are present, compared to isolated systems.

Sub-question 4: Can AI-driven image analysis and agent-based modeling synthesize disparate datasets to predict novel emergent patterns not observable in individual studies? We hypothesize that fusing Cytodata images with PDB kinetics via machine learning will uncover hidden patterns, such as oscillatory waves in hybrid networks. Predictions are that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will classify self-organized states with >90% accuracy, enabling hypothesis generation for untested conditions.

These hypotheses are testable using synthesis methods: agent-based simulations will model predictions, with validation against held-out data subsets. Expected outcomes include computational models of cytoskeletal emergence, publicly shared via repositories like GitHub, and peer-reviewed publications detailing validated hypotheses. Deliverables encompass integrated datasets, AI algorithms for pattern recognition, and simulation software packages.

Testing and validation will involve iterative cycles: first, parameterize models from data; second, run simulations to generate predictions; third, compare outputs to independent public datasets (e.g., from EMBL-EBI) using metrics like root-mean-square error for structural fits or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for distribution matching. Sensitivity analyses will assess robustness, perturbing parameters by ±10% to confirm emergent behaviors persist. If hypotheses are falsified (e.g., no threshold effect observed), we will refine models to incorporate additional factors like pH dependencies from literature.

Overall, these questions and hypotheses address long-standing puzzles in motility, such as how cells maintain directed migration despite noise, and division, like spindle positioning accuracy. By focusing on mechanical emergence, this work differentiates from biochemical network studies, promising deeper insights into cellular robustness and adaptability. (678 words)

(2) Protein Data Bank (PDB) for atomic structures, such as actin (1J6Z), tubulin (1TUB), and complexes like Arp2/3 (1K8K), yielding kinetic parameters via molecular dynamics inferences. (3) BioNumbers and SABIO-RK databases for quantitative kinetics, including polymerization rates (e.g., actin: 0.6 μM⁻¹s⁻¹ for association), catastrophe frequencies (microtubules: 0.002 s⁻¹), and diffusion coefficients. (4) Additional repositories like Image Data Resource (IDR) for annotated images and the Virtual Cell database for baseline models. Data fusion will harmonize formats using tools like Bioformats and Pandas, ensuring compatibility across >10,000 images and parameter sets.

Analytical methods center on agent-based modeling (ABM) and AI-driven image analysis. For ABM, we will use Cytosim software, extended with custom scripts in Python/C++ to simulate monomer interactions. Models will incorporate stochastic rules: actin monomers polymerize via Brownian dynamics, with branching via Arp2/3 probabilities; microtubules via Gillespie algorithms for dynamic instability. Mechanical forces will be modeled using Langevin equations, accounting for viscoelasticity (e.g., spring-dashpot elements for crosslinks). Parameters will be calibrated from data, with Monte Carlo sampling for variability.

For image analysis, we will deploy convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via TensorFlow/Keras for pattern recognition. Training on Cytodata subsets will classify structures (e.g., lamellar vs. filopodial actin) with U-Net architectures for segmentation, achieving >85% IoU accuracy. AI will extract features like filament length distributions and curvature, feeding into ABM validations. Integration involves a pipeline: AI-processed images inform initial conditions for simulations, which predict dynamics compared to time-series data.

The approach is structured as a working group with quarterly virtual meetings and two annual in-person workshops, involving 8-10 members from cytoskeletal biology (e.g., lead PI's lab), physics (biomechanics experts), and computer vision (AI specialists) across institutions in the US, Europe, and Asia.

Months 25-30: Crosstalk analyses and sensitivity studies; Deliverable: Comprehensive simulation package. Months 31-36: Synthesis of findings, manuscript preparation; Final deliverable: Public repository of all workflows.

Statistical analyses include Bayesian inference for parameter estimation (using PyMC3) to quantify uncertainties, with posterior distributions assessing hypothesis credibility (e.g., Bayes factors >3 for support). Validation uses cross-validation: 70/30 train/test splits on datasets, with non-parametric tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U) for comparing simulated vs. observed distributions. Controls involve null models (e.g., random polymerization without branching) to isolate emergent effects. Replicates will be computational: 100-500 simulation runs per condition to ensure statistical power (e.g., detecting 10% differences at α=0.05).

This methods framework requires NCEMS support for coordination, as data scale (terabytes) and expertise diversity exceed single-lab resources.

The maintenance of genomic stability is a cornerstone of cellular function, ensuring the fidelity of genetic information across generations and preventing diseases such as cancer. DNA damage occurs ubiquitously due to endogenous processes like replication errors and exogenous factors including UV radiation and chemical mutagens. Cells have evolved intricate DNA damage response (DDR) networks to detect, signal, and repair these lesions, thereby preserving genomic integrity. These networks encompass multiple pathways, including base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, the emergent properties arising from the crosstalk between these pathways remain poorly understood, representing a fundamental puzzle in molecular and cellular biosciences.

Current understanding of DDR is largely derived from reductionist approaches, focusing on individual proteins or isolated pathways. For instance, landmark studies have elucidated key players like ATM and ATR kinases in damage signaling, and enzymes such as PARP in repair initiation. Seminal work by Jackson and Bartek (2009) in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology highlighted the hierarchical organization of DDR, where damage sensors activate checkpoints and repair mechanisms. Similarly, Ciccia and Elledge (2010) in Molecular Cell reviewed the fan-out of signaling cascades from initial lesions. Yet, these studies often overlook the holistic integration of pathways, where emergent behaviors—such as cooperative or competitive interactions—arise from network-level dynamics.

Literature on genomic instability databases provides a wealth of data for synthesis. The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database, maintained by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, catalogs over 37 million coding mutations from thousands of cancer genomes, offering insights into mutation spectra associated with repair deficiencies. For example, Tate et al. (2019) in Nucleic Acids Research described COSMIC's role in identifying signatures of mutational processes, such as those linked to MMR defects in colorectal cancers. The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, integrates multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other consortia, enabling queries on gene alterations, expression, and survival outcomes. Cerami et al. (2012) in Cancer Discovery demonstrated its utility in visualizing co-occurring mutations in DDR genes like BRCA1/2.

Specialized DDR databases, such as the DNA Damage Response Knowledgebase (DDRKB) and REPAIRtoire, compile information on repair proteins, pathways, and interactions. Milanowska et al. (2011) in Nucleic Acids Research introduced REPAIRtoire as a resource for pathway crosstalk, noting overlaps between BER and NER in handling oxidative damage. Despite these resources, integration across datasets is fragmented. Most analyses are siloed, failing to capture emergent phenomena like pathway redundancy or switching, which could explain why certain repair failures lead to catastrophic genomic instability, as seen in syndromes like Fanconi anemia or Lynch syndrome.

Key gaps in the field include the lack of models that account for probabilistic and game-theoretic interactions in DDR networks. Traditional deterministic models, such as those using ordinary differential equations for kinase activation (e.g., Batchelor et al., 2009 in Molecular Systems Biology), do not fully capture stochastic elements or strategic pathway choices under resource constraints. Game theory, applied in evolutionary biology by Nowak (2006) in Science, offers a framework for modeling cooperative behaviors, yet its application to DDR crosstalk is nascent. Probabilistic modeling, as in Bayesian networks for gene regulation (Friedman, 2004 in Journal of Computational Biology), could elucidate uncertainty in damage propagation, but large-scale synthesis is absent.

Limitations stem from the scale and diversity of data: individual labs struggle with integrating petabyte-scale datasets from COSMIC and cBioPortal, requiring computational expertise beyond typical molecular biology groups. Moreover, transdisciplinary collaboration is rare; genomicists provide data curation, theoretical biologists model emergence, and statisticians handle inference, but such teams are not commonplace.

This research is timely amid the explosion of public data from initiatives like TCGA and the International Cancer Genome Consortium, which have generated terabytes of genomic information. The COVID-19 era underscored the value of data synthesis in rapid scientific advances, as seen in protein structure predictions via AlphaFold. Addressing emergent DDR networks could unravel enigmas like why some cells tolerate high mutation loads without malignancy, informing cancer therapies. With rising incidences of genomic instability-related diseases, synthesizing these data collaboratively aligns with national priorities in precision medicine, as outlined in the NIH's All of Us Research Program. By fostering multidisciplinary teams and trainee involvement, this project catalyzes innovative strategies, filling critical gaps and advancing molecular sciences toward a systems-level understanding of genomic stability.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project addresses fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing public data to uncover emergent properties in DNA damage response (DDR) networks. The overarching aim is to explore how crosstalk between repair pathways generates novel behaviors that maintain genomic integrity, using game theory and probabilistic modeling. This approach departs from traditional pathway-centric views, focusing instead on network-level emergence.

Specific Research Question 1: How do interactions between DNA repair pathways, such as BER, NER, and HR, give rise to emergent signaling networks that propagate damage responses across the genome? This question targets the synthesis of mutation and expression data to map crosstalk points, examining how signals amplify or dampen in response to varying damage types.

Hypothesis 1a: Pathway crosstalk will exhibit cooperative emergence, where activation of one pathway (e.g., BER for oxidative lesions) probabilistically enhances HR efficiency in double-strand break repair, leading to reduced mutation rates in synthesized cancer genomes. Prediction: In datasets with high oxidative damage signatures (from COSMIC), co-occurrence of BER and HR gene activations (from cBioPortal) will correlate with lower genomic instability scores, testable via correlation analyses.

Hypothesis 1b: Competitive interactions will emerge under resource-limited conditions, such as ATP depletion, where NHEJ dominates over HR, increasing error-prone repairs. Prediction: Probabilistic models will show higher indel mutations in resource-constrained cellular contexts, validated against DDR database entries.

Research Question 2: Can game-theoretic models predict the strategic choices of repair pathways in maintaining genomic stability, particularly in the context of multiple simultaneous DNA lesions? This probes the 'decision-making' aspect of networks, treating pathways as players in a game optimizing for survival.

Hypothesis 2a: In a non-cooperative game framework, pathways will evolve Nash equilibria where dominant strategies (e.g., rapid NHEJ) prevail in acute damage scenarios, but cooperative equilibria emerge in chronic exposures, minimizing overall genomic entropy. Prediction: Simulations using game theory on integrated datasets will forecast lower cancer risk in cooperative states, matching observed survival data from cBioPortal.

Hypothesis 2b: Stochastic perturbations, modeled probabilistically, will disrupt equilibria, leading to repair failures in heterogeneous tumor environments. Prediction: Bayesian inference will identify tipping points where mutation loads exceed repair capacity, aligning with instability patterns in COSMIC.

Research Question 3: What novel analytical strategies can be developed to integrate disparate DDR datasets for predicting genomic instability risks, and how do these strategies resolve long-standing puzzles like variable repair efficacies across cell types? This focuses on methodological innovation through data synthesis.

Hypothesis 3a: A hybrid game-probabilistic model will outperform traditional machine learning in predicting repair outcomes, achieving >80% accuracy in classifying stable vs. unstable genomes from synthesized data. Prediction: Cross-validation on held-out datasets will demonstrate superior AUC-ROC scores compared to logistic regression baselines.

Hypothesis 3b: Emergent network motifs, identified via graph theory, will explain enigmas such as why MMR defects lead to microsatellite instability but not always cancer, revealing context-dependent modulators. Prediction: Motif frequency analyses will correlate with clinical outcomes, validated against literature benchmarks.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A comprehensive atlas of emergent DDR networks, publicly accessible via an interactive web portal; (2) Open-source risk prediction tools for genomic instability, applicable to personalized medicine; (3) Peer-reviewed publications detailing models and findings; (4) Trained graduate students and postdocs in transdisciplinary synthesis.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative data integration and modeling. Validation involves statistical rigor, such as bootstrapping for confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses for model robustness. External validation will use independent datasets from sources like DepMap. If hypotheses are falsified (e.g., no emergent cooperation detected), we will refine models to incorporate additional variables like epigenetic modifiers, ensuring adaptive research progression. This framework ensures testable, falsifiable predictions, advancing understanding of DDR emergence. (678 words)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project leverages publicly available data exclusively, integrating datasets from COSMIC, cBioPortal, and DDR-specific databases to model emergent DNA damage response (DDR) networks. No new experimental data will be generated; instead, we focus on computational synthesis requiring multidisciplinary collaboration beyond single-lab capabilities.

Data Sources and Datasets: Primary sources include COSMIC (v95), providing somatic mutation data from >10,000 cancer genomes, including mutation types, spectra, and signatures linked to repair deficiencies. We will extract subsets on DDR genes (e.g., ATM, BRCA1/2, MLH1) for ~5 million mutations. cBioPortal (v3.0) offers multi-omics data from TCGA and other studies, encompassing gene expression, copy number variations, and survival metrics for ~50,000 samples. We will query integrated profiles for DDR pathway activations, such as phosphorylation states inferred from proteomics. DDR databases like REPAIRtoire and DDRKB provide curated interaction networks, protein domains, and pathway maps for ~500 repair proteins. Additional public repositories, such as STRING for protein-protein interactions and Gene Ontology for functional annotations, will supplement crosstalk data. Data integration will use standardized formats (e.g., MAF for mutations, RSEM for expression) via APIs and bulk downloads, ensuring reproducibility.

Analytical Methods and Computational Approaches: We employ a transdisciplinary pipeline: genomicists curate and preprocess data, theoretical biologists develop models, and statisticians perform inference. Key innovations include game-theoretic and probabilistic modeling for emergence.

Step 1: Data Synthesis and Network Construction. Using Python (Pandas, NetworkX), we integrate datasets into a unified graph where nodes represent DDR components (genes, proteins) and edges denote interactions (e.g., activation, inhibition) weighted by evidence from databases. Crosstalk will be quantified via overlap scores, e.g., Jaccard indices for shared substrates between BER and NER.

Step 2: Probabilistic Modeling. Bayesian networks (via PyMC3) will model uncertainty in damage propagation, with priors from mutation frequencies and likelihoods from expression correlations. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (10,000 iterations) will estimate posterior distributions of network states under damage scenarios.

Step 3: Game-Theoretic Modeling. We frame pathways as players in cooperative/non-cooperative games using NashPy library. Payoffs are defined by genomic stability metrics (e.g., mutation rate reduction as reward). For multiple lesions, evolutionary game theory (via EGTtools) simulates strategy evolution over iterations, identifying emergent equilibria.

Step 4: Hybrid Integration and Simulation. A unified framework combines probabilistic outputs as inputs to games, enabling large-scale simulations on NCEMS high-performance computing resources (e.g., GPU clusters for 1,000+ scenarios). Risk prediction tools will use machine learning (Scikit-learn) trained on synthesized features, with ensemble methods (random forests) for robustness.

Experimental Design: Though computational, we design in silico 'experiments' with controls. Base cases simulate isolated pathways; treatment cases introduce crosstalk. 'Replicates' involve bootstrapped data subsets (n=100) to assess variability. Controls include null models (random networks) to test significance via permutation tests (p<0.05).

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 (Months 1-6): Data curation and integration; deliverable: Unified DDR dataset repository on GitHub. Months 7-12: Model development and initial simulations; deliverable: Prototype game-probabilistic framework with preliminary results. Year 2 (Months 13-18): Hypothesis testing and validation; deliverable: Risk prediction tool beta version. Months 19-24: Refinement, trainee-led analyses, and manuscript preparation; deliverable: Final atlas and tools. Quarterly virtual meetings via NCEMS platforms ensure collaboration. Milestones are tracked with Gantt charts, with adaptive pivots if integration challenges arise.

Statistical Analysis Plans: Descriptive statistics summarize network properties (e.g., degree distributions). Inferential tests include Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distribution comparisons and ANOVA for group differences in simulation outcomes. For predictions, we use cross-validation (10-fold) with metrics like precision-recall curves. Bayesian analyses incorporate credible intervals (95%). Power analyses ensure sufficient 'sample' size from data subsets to detect effects (power=0.8, alpha=0.05). All code will be version-controlled and shared openly.

This approach requires NCEMS support for computational scale, fostering a team of genomicists (lead PI from a research university), theoretical biologists (co-PI from a modeling institute), statisticians (co-PI from a stats department), plus trainees (2 postdocs, 4 grad students) from diverse institutions. Open science principles guide public sharing via Zenodo and FAIR-compliant repositories. (892 words)

Unlike protein interaction or condensate focuses, it targets assembly emergence, employing kinetic modeling and graph theory.

Structural biologists, biochemists, and modelers collaborate via NCEMS-supported platforms. Activities yield assembly maps, resolving biogenesis puzzles. Open workflows train diverse talent in data synthesis.",,"Background And Significance

Ribosomes are fundamental molecular machines responsible for protein synthesis in all living organisms, translating genetic information into functional proteins. Composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins, eukaryotic ribosomes consist of small (40S) and large (60S) subunits that assemble into the 80S ribosome. The assembly process, known as ribosome biogenesis, is a highly orchestrated, energy-intensive pathway occurring primarily in the nucleolus and involving over 200 assembly factors. This process is not merely a linear sequence but exhibits emergent properties where complex interactions among components lead to the formation of functional structures. Emergence in this context refers to how simple subunit interactions give rise to higher-order functionalities that cannot be predicted from individual parts alone.

The current state of the field has advanced significantly with high-throughput technologies. Proteomic studies, such as those cataloged in RiboGalaxy, provide quantitative data on ribosomal protein compositions, post-translational modifications, and interaction networks across various cellular conditions and organisms. For instance, mass spectrometry-based proteomics has revealed dynamic changes in ribosomal protein stoichiometry during stress responses or development (e.g., studies by Warner et al., 2019, in yeast models). Concurrently, structural biology, particularly cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), has revolutionized our understanding of ribosomal structures. The EMDataBank (EMDB) hosts thousands of high-resolution structures, including intermediate states of ribosomal assembly captured in works by Barandun et al. (2017), which depicted pre-60S particles with associated factors.

Literature review highlights key contributions: Early biochemical work by Nomura (1973) proposed a hierarchical assembly map for bacterial ribosomes, emphasizing cooperative interactions. In eukaryotes, Klinge and Woolford (2019) reviewed the modular assembly of 40S and 60S subunits, involving rRNA folding, protein binding, and quality control checkpoints. Recent integrative studies, such as those using single-particle cryo-EM (e.g., Kargas et al., 2019), have visualized transient intermediates, revealing how assembly factors like GTPases facilitate subunit maturation. Proteomic integrations, as in the work of Thomson et al. (2020), have linked assembly defects to diseases like ribosomopathies (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia), where mutations in ribosomal proteins disrupt biogenesis.

Despite these advances, significant gaps persist. Most studies focus on static snapshots or pairwise interactions, overlooking the emergent dynamics of the entire assembly pathway. For example, while protein-protein interaction networks are well-mapped (e.g., via STRING database integrations), the kinetic and thermodynamic principles governing how these interactions lead to functional emergence remain underexplored. Long-standing puzzles include: How do stochastic subunit associations result in robust, error-free assembly? What role do non-equilibrium processes play in emergence, akin to those in phase separation but specific to ribosomal contexts? Limitations in current knowledge stem from siloed data: Proteomic datasets often lack structural context, while cryo-EM structures are not systematically integrated with kinetic data. Individual labs struggle with the scale—analyzing terabytes of data requires computational expertise beyond typical biochemists, and structural biologists may lack modeling tools for dynamics.

This research is important because ribosomes are central to cellular homeostasis, and dysregulation links to cancer, aging, and infectious diseases. For instance, viral hijacking of ribosomal assembly (e.g., in SARS-CoV-2, as per Gordon et al., 2020) underscores the need for deeper insights. It is timely amid the explosion of public data repositories and advances in AI-driven modeling, enabling synthesis without new experiments. By integrating proteomic and structural data, this project addresses emergence phenomena, aligning with NCEMS goals to solve puzzles through multidisciplinary synthesis. It promises to uncover novel assembly pathways, potentially revealing therapeutic targets. Moreover, it fosters collaboration across fields—structural biology, biochemistry, and computational modeling—tapping diverse talent and training the next generation in data-savvy approaches. In an era of big data, such synthesis is crucial for advancing molecular and cellular sciences beyond reductionist views, towards holistic understanding of biological complexity. This work will not only resolve biogenesis puzzles but also set precedents for emergent studies in other macromolecular assemblies, like spliceosomes or proteasomes, amplifying its significance in the broader biosciences landscape.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses fundamental questions about the emergent assembly of ribosomes by integrating publicly available proteomic and cryo-EM data. We focus on how interactions among ribosomal subunits and assembly factors give rise to functional translation machinery, emphasizing emergence over static interactions or phase condensates. The research is structured around three specific, interrelated questions, each with testable hypotheses, predictions, and validation strategies.

Research Question 1: How do dynamic interactions between ribosomal proteins and rRNA subunits contribute to emergent assembly pathways, particularly in eukaryotic systems? This question probes the transition from disordered precursors to ordered functional ribosomes, leveraging data from diverse organisms to identify conserved emergent patterns.

Hypothesis 1a: Cooperative binding of ribosomal proteins to rRNA scaffolds follows a kinetic hierarchy, where early interactions stabilize intermediates, leading to emergent stability in later stages. Prediction: Integration of proteomic stoichiometry from RiboGalaxy with cryo-EM density maps from EMDB will reveal a graph-based network where node connectivity (proteins) increases non-linearly, predicting assembly bottlenecks at specific intermediates (e.g., pre-40S states). Expected Outcome: A kinetic assembly map highlighting emergent points where subunit joining yields functional competence, such as GTPase activation thresholds.

Hypothesis 1b: Stochastic variations in protein abundance, as seen in proteomic datasets, drive alternative assembly pathways that converge on functional ribosomes via emergent error-correction mechanisms. Prediction: Modeling will show that perturbations (e.g., simulated knockdowns) result in pathway divergence but functional convergence, validated by comparing predicted maps to known ribosomopathy data. Deliverable: Interactive assembly pathway diagrams deposited in public repositories.

Research Question 2: What role do non-equilibrium processes, such as kinetic trapping, play in the emergence of ribosomal functionality from subunit interactions? This targets long-standing puzzles like how assembly avoids misfolded states, using graph theory to model transitions.

Hypothesis 2a: Kinetic modeling of assembly trajectories will demonstrate that emergent functionality arises from rate-limiting steps where subunit interfaces form irreversibly, preventing backtracking. Prediction: Applying Markov chain models to integrated datasets will predict energy landscapes with deep minima corresponding to functional states, testable by correlating with experimental kinetics from literature (e.g., pulse-labeling studies). Expected Outcome: Quantitative models of assembly rates, revealing emergent robustness (e.g., assembly efficiency >90% despite noise).

Hypothesis 2b: Graph theory analysis will identify modular subnetworks in assembly graphs that exhibit emergent properties, such as self-organization, not evident in isolated modules. Prediction: Subgraph density will correlate with functional emergence, validated against cryo-EM structures of assembly intermediates. Deliverable: Open-source graph models for ribosomal biogenesis simulations.

Research Question 3: How can integrative data synthesis resolve discrepancies in ribosomal assembly models across species, informing universal principles of emergence? This question synthesizes data to bridge prokaryotic and eukaryotic models, addressing gaps in comparative biogenesis.

Hypothesis 3a: Cross-species integration will reveal conserved emergent motifs, such as feedback loops in subunit maturation, despite sequence divergences. Prediction: Meta-analysis will show motif enrichment in functional ribosomes, with predictions testable via alignment to evolutionary data (e.g., from OrthoDB). Expected Outcome: A unified emergence framework applicable to synthetic biology designs.

Hypothesis 3b: Discrepancies in assembly puzzles (e.g., factor dependencies) stem from overlooked emergent interactions, resolvable through machine learning clustering. Prediction: Clusters will group similar pathways, predicting novel interactions confirmed by literature cross-referencing. Deliverable: Curated datasets and predictive tools for assembly perturbations.

Hypotheses will be tested through computational synthesis: Kinetic models via Gillespie algorithms, graph theory using NetworkX, and validation by statistical comparisons (e.g., Pearson correlations) to independent datasets. Validation includes sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against gold-standard structures (e.g., PDB entries). Expected overall outcomes include resolved assembly maps, published workflows, and trained personnel, advancing molecular sciences by demonstrating how data synthesis uncovers emergence.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project relies exclusively on publicly available data, integrating proteomic datasets from RiboGalaxy and structural data from EMDataBank (EMDB), without generating new experimental data. RiboGalaxy provides comprehensive ribosomal proteomic information, including quantitative mass spectrometry data on protein compositions, interactions, and modifications across species (e.g., yeast, human, bacteria), with over 500 datasets encompassing stoichiometry under normal and stress conditions. EMDB hosts cryo-EM structures, including high-resolution maps of ribosomal intermediates (e.g., >1,000 entries for pre-ribosomal particles, resolutions 2-5 Å), such as those from the Klinge lab depicting 40S maturation states. Additional sources include PDB for atomic models, STRING for interaction networks, and UniProt for annotations, ensuring a rich, diverse data pool.

Analytical methods center on kinetic modeling and graph theory to investigate emergent assembly. First, data integration: Proteomic data will be harmonized with structural data using bioinformatics pipelines. For instance, proteomic profiles will be mapped onto cryo-EM density maps via tools like ChimeraX for visualization and PyMOL for alignment, identifying protein occupancy in intermediates. Graph theory will model assembly as directed graphs, where nodes represent proteins/rRNA segments and edges denote interactions (affinities derived from proteomic binding data). NetworkX library in Python will construct and analyze these graphs, computing metrics like centrality and modularity to detect emergent subnetworks.

Kinetic modeling employs stochastic simulations: Gillespie algorithms will simulate assembly trajectories, parameterizing rates from proteomic kinetics (e.g., incorporation rates) and structural constraints (e.g., interface energies from EMDB-derived models). Markov state models (MSMs) will be built using MSMBuilder to predict transition probabilities between assembly states, incorporating non-equilibrium dynamics. Machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) via PyTorch Geometric, will predict emergent properties from integrated features, trained on subsets of data and validated on hold-out sets.

The approach is purely computational, with no experimental design involving new data collection. Instead, 'virtual experiments' simulate perturbations (e.g., protein knockdowns) by altering model parameters, using controls like baseline wild-type simulations. Replicates will be statistical: Monte Carlo simulations (n=1000) to assess variability, ensuring robustness. Statistical analysis includes hypothesis testing (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distribution comparisons), correlation analyses (Spearman for non-parametric data), and error propagation in models. Validation metrics: Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for structural predictions against EMDB entries, and accuracy scores for kinetic predictions versus literature benchmarks (e.g., assembly times from pulse-chase studies).

Collaboration is key, involving structural biologists (expertise in cryo-EM interpretation), biochemists (proteomic insights), and computational modelers (kinetic/graph algorithms). The team comprises 6-8 members from diverse institutions (e.g., US, Europe, Asia), including early-career researchers and trainees (2 postdocs, 3 graduate students). NCEMS platforms will facilitate virtual meetings, data sharing via Jupyter notebooks, and collaborative coding on GitHub.

Timeline spans 36 months: Months 1-6: Data curation and integration (Milestone: Harmonized dataset repository). Months 7-12: Graph construction and initial modeling (Milestone: Preliminary assembly graphs). Months 13-18: Kinetic simulations and ML training (Milestone: Emergent pathway models). Months 19-24: Validation and refinement (Milestone: Validated maps with predictions). Months 25-30: Synthesis of cross-species insights (Milestone: Unified emergence framework). Months 31-36: Dissemination and training (Milestone: Publications, workflows, trainee-led workshops). Quarterly virtual meetings and annual in-person workshops (if funded) ensure progress. Risks, like data inconsistencies, will be mitigated by standardized ontologies (e.g., GO terms) and sensitivity analyses. This approach adheres to open science: All code, models, and findings will be shared via Zenodo and GitHub under CC-BY licenses, promoting reproducibility and training through hands-on modules for trainees.

Conference presentations at ASBMB or EMBO meetings will share results. Public outreach includes blogs, webinars, and educational modules for undergraduates. Publication strategy emphasizes open access, with data/workflows in repositories like Figshare. Sustainability involves archiving tools for community use, seeking extensions via grants, and integrating into curricula, ensuring lasting impact on emergence studies in biosciences.

The plant cell wall is a dynamic and complex structure that provides mechanical support, regulates growth, and serves as a barrier against environmental stresses. Composed primarily of polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins, along with proteins and lignin in secondary walls, the cell wall's biomechanical properties emerge from intricate interactions among these components. Understanding these emergent properties is crucial for advancing molecular and cellular biosciences, particularly in the context of plant biology, where cell walls dictate organ-level mechanics and overall plant resilience. This proposal focuses on synthesizing publicly available data to uncover how molecular-level interactions give rise to macroscopic biomechanical behaviors, addressing a fundamental question in emergence phenomena.

Current research in plant cell wall biology has made significant strides through experimental approaches, including genetic manipulations, biochemical assays, and imaging techniques. For instance, studies using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism have elucidated the roles of specific enzymes in wall synthesis, such as cellulose synthases (CESAs) that form rosette complexes to produce cellulose microfibrils (McFarlane et al., 2014). High-throughput datasets from repositories like AraPort, the Arabidopsis Information Portal, provide comprehensive genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data on wall components. Similarly, databases such as the Plant Cell Wall Database (PCWD) and Bio-Analytic Resource (BAR) offer mechanical property measurements from techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and tensile testing. These resources have enabled insights into individual polymer behaviors; for example, xyloglucan-cellulose interactions have been shown to influence wall extensibility (Park and Cosgrove, 2015).

However, the field remains fragmented, with most studies focusing on isolated components rather than their integrated, emergent properties. Literature reviews highlight that while microbial and animal cell mechanics have been modeled extensively—e.g., bacterial peptidoglycan walls or animal extracellular matrices—plant cell walls present unique challenges due to their anisotropic, multilayered architecture and turgor pressure influences (Geitmann and Ortega, 2013). Key works, such as those by Dyson et al. (2014), have used computational models to simulate wall growth, but these often rely on simplified assumptions and lack integration of diverse datasets. A comprehensive review by Zhang et al. (2020) in Annual Review of Plant Biology underscores the need for synthesis approaches to bridge molecular composition with biomechanical outcomes, noting that emergent properties like viscoelasticity and fracture toughness arise from nonlinear polymer interactions not predictable from single-component studies.

Significant gaps persist in understanding how these interactions scale up. For example, while cellulose microfibril orientation affects wall stiffness, the interplay with pectin methylation states and hemicellulose branching remains poorly quantified across species and developmental stages. Limitations include the silos between disciplines: plant biologists generate compositional data, but materials scientists are needed for advanced modeling of mechanics. Existing models, such as those based on linear elasticity, fail to capture nonlinear behaviors under stress, leading to inaccurate predictions of wall failure in scenarios like drought or pathogen attack (Milani et al., 2013). Moreover, much of the data is scattered across repositories, unintegrated, and underutilized for emergent analyses.

This research is timely and important because climate change exacerbates plant stresses, necessitating resilient crops. Synthesizing data to reveal emergent properties can inform bioengineering for enhanced biomass production, biofuel efficiency, and food security. The NCEMS call emphasizes multidisciplinary synthesis to address such puzzles, and this project aligns by integrating plant biology with materials science, using only public data to foster novel insights. By tackling these gaps, we can advance fundamental knowledge of cellular emergence, where molecular interactions yield properties greater than the sum of parts, paralleling concepts in complex systems biology (Karsenti, 2008). This work will catalyze broader applications, from sustainable materials to synthetic biology, while training a data-savvy workforce in collaborative synthesis.

In summary, the current state reveals a wealth of data but a dearth of integrated analyses for plant-specific emergence. This proposal addresses these limitations through a transdisciplinary approach, promising to solve long-standing puzzles in how cell wall polymers collectively engender mechanical strength, with implications for molecular biosciences and beyond.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is driven by well-defined research questions that leverage publicly available data to explore emergent biomechanical properties in plant cell walls. By integrating compositional and mechanical datasets, we aim to uncover how molecular interactions give rise to higher-order behaviors, advancing molecular and cellular sciences through a collaborative, data-driven lens.

The primary research question is: How do interactions among cell wall polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins, and lignin) contribute to emergent biomechanical properties such as tensile strength, viscoelasticity, and fracture toughness in plant cells? This question addresses a fundamental emergence phenomenon, where individual polymer behaviors do not fully predict the wall's overall mechanics. Sub-questions include: (1) What patterns emerge when integrating compositional data across plant species and developmental stages? (2) How do variations in polymer crosslinking and orientation influence stress distribution under simulated loads? (3) Can finite element models accurately predict wall failure modes based on synthesized data, and what novel analytical strategies can enhance these predictions?

To guide our synthesis, we propose the following testable hypotheses with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Increased cellulose-hemicellulose crosslinking enhances emergent tensile strength beyond additive effects, predicting that walls with higher xyloglucan branching (from AraPort metabolomic data) will exhibit 20-30% greater stiffness in finite element simulations compared to low-branching variants. This will be tested by correlating public AFM stiffness measurements with compositional profiles, expecting nonlinear amplification in strength metrics.

Hypothesis 2: Pectin demethylation modulates viscoelastic properties, leading to emergent plasticity; we predict that datasets showing higher pectin methylesterase activity will correlate with increased creep rates under sustained loads, quantifiable through time-dependent modeling. Validation involves synthesizing rheological data from BAR and PCWD, with expected outcomes including predictive curves showing 15-25% higher extensibility in demethylated walls.

Hypothesis 3: Lignin incorporation in secondary walls creates emergent fracture toughness via energy dissipation mechanisms; we hypothesize that lignin-rich datasets will demonstrate reduced crack propagation in models, predicting a 40% increase in toughness metrics compared to primary walls. This will be assessed using fracture mechanics simulations integrated with proteomic data, anticipating deliverables like validated toughness maps across plant taxa.

Expected outcomes include a comprehensive database of synthesized cell wall properties, open-source finite element models for stress prediction, and peer-reviewed publications detailing emergent patterns. Deliverables encompass: (1) An integrated dataset repository on platforms like Zenodo, (2) Analytical workflows for polymer interaction modeling, and (3) Training modules for trainees on data synthesis.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative data integration and modeling. Validation involves cross-referencing predictions with independent public datasets (e.g., from different species like maize or rice), using statistical measures such as correlation coefficients and model fit errors (e.g., RMSE < 10%). Sensitivity analyses will assess robustness, ensuring predictions hold across variabilities. If hypotheses are supported, we expect breakthroughs in understanding plant-specific emergence, distinct from microbial or animal systems. If not, it will highlight overlooked variables, prompting refined models. This approach ensures scientific rigor, with milestones including quarterly hypothesis evaluations and annual reports. Overall, these questions and hypotheses will foster innovative strategies, stimulating cross-disciplinary insights and training the next generation in synthesis research. (648 words)

Methods And Approach

This project will synthesize publicly available data exclusively, without generating new experimental data, to investigate emergent biomechanical properties of plant cell walls. We will integrate datasets from repositories such as AraPort (Arabidopsis-focused genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data), the Plant Cell Wall Database (PCWD; compositional and structural data), Bio-Analytic Resource (BAR; mechanical and imaging data), and others like Phytozome (comparative genomics across species) and the Materials Project (for polymer mechanics analogies). Specific datasets include: cellulose synthase expression profiles from AraPort, AFM-based stiffness measurements from PCWD, tensile strength data from plant biomechanics studies in PubMed Central, and hemicellulose/pectin composition from metabolomic repositories like MetaboLights. We will curate over 500 datasets spanning Arabidopsis, maize, poplar, and other model plants, ensuring diversity in developmental stages and environmental conditions.

Analytical methods will center on computational integration and modeling. First, data harmonization will use ontologies like Plant Ontology and Gene Ontology to standardize variables (e.g., aligning 'cellulose content' across sources). We will employ machine learning for pattern recognition, such as clustering algorithms (k-means) to identify emergent property clusters based on polymer compositions. For biomechanical emergence, finite element modeling (FEM) will be pivotal, using open-source software like FEniCS or Abaqus to simulate wall structures. Models will represent the wall as a composite material with layers: primary wall (pectin-rich), secondary wall (lignified), incorporating anisotropic properties from public data. Inputs include microfibril angles from imaging datasets and crosslinking densities from proteomic interactions (e.g., via STRING database integrations).

The approach involves a transdisciplinary working group: plant biologists from two labs (e.g., University of California and Cornell University) providing expertise on wall biochemistry, materials scientists from a third lab (e.g., MIT) handling FEM and mechanics, and computational biologists for data analytics. Collaboration requires NCEMS support for virtual meetings, data storage, and trainee stipends, as individual labs lack the bandwidth for such large-scale synthesis.

The experimental design is computational, with 'experiments' as simulation runs. Controls include baseline models with uniform polymer distributions, compared to variable-integrated models. Replicates will involve Monte Carlo simulations (n=1000 per scenario) to account for data variability. Phases include: Year 1 - Data curation and integration (milestone: unified database); Year 2 - Model development and hypothesis testing (milestone: preliminary stress prediction models); Year 3 - Validation and refinement (milestone: open-source toolkit release).

Timeline: Months 1-6: Assemble team, curate data (deliverable: metadata report). Months 7-12: Develop integration pipelines using Python/R (e.g., Pandas for dataframes, SciPy for stats). Months 13-24: Build FEM models, simulate interactions (e.g., apply virtual loads to predict stress-strain curves). Months 25-36: Validate against independent datasets, train participants (deliverable: workshops and publications).

Statistical analysis plans include regression models to correlate compositions with mechanics (e.g., multivariate linear regression for strength predictions, with p<0.05 significance). ANOVA will compare emergent properties across species, and machine learning validation via cross-validation (80/20 split) to ensure model accuracy (e.g., R² > 0.8). Sensitivity analyses will perturb inputs (e.g., ±10% in crosslinking) to assess robustness.

Open science principles will be adhered to: all workflows on GitHub, data on Zenodo under CC-BY licenses. Trainees (two graduate students, one postdoc per lab) will participate in all stages, gaining skills in data synthesis, modeling, and collaboration through bi-weekly meetings and annual retreats. This method ensures rigorous, reproducible synthesis, fostering innovative strategies like hybrid ML-FEM approaches for plant-specific emergence. (852 words)

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing data to reveal emergent biomechanical properties in plant cell walls. Key outcomes include an integrated open-access database synthesizing over 500 public datasets, providing a unified resource for wall composition-mechanics relationships. We anticipate developing validated finite element models that predict stress responses with high accuracy (e.g., RMSE < 10%), enabling simulations of how polymer interactions yield emergent strength—insights unattainable from isolated studies. Deliverables will encompass peer-reviewed publications (targeting journals like Plant Physiology and Advanced Materials), open-source code repositories, and interactive web tools for model exploration.

Broader impacts extend to agriculture and bioengineering. By elucidating how walls achieve mechanical resilience, our findings could inform crop breeding for stress-tolerant varieties, enhancing food security amid climate change. For instance, models predicting wall failure under drought could guide genetic modifications, potentially increasing biomass yields by 15-20%. In materials science, plant-inspired composites could inspire sustainable biomaterials, reducing reliance on synthetics. The project's emphasis on emergence will advance fundamental understanding in cellular sciences, bridging molecular interactions to macroscopic phenotypes, with parallels to other systems like fungal hyphae or algal walls.

Potential for follow-up research is substantial, including extensions to non-model plants or integration with emerging datasets (e.g., single-cell omics). We envision spawning new collaborations, such as with synthetic biologists for wall engineering or ecologists for environmental adaptations. NCEMS support will seed a self-sustaining network, with working group members pursuing subsequent grants (e.g., NSF or DOE funding).

Dissemination plans include presenting at conferences like the American Society of Plant Biologists and Materials Research Society meetings, ensuring wide reach. Publication strategy targets high-impact open-access journals, with preprints on bioRxiv for rapid sharing. We will host webinars and workshops, training over 50 external participants in synthesis methods. All outputs will adhere to open science, with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for data and workflows.

Long-term vision involves establishing a community hub for plant cell wall synthesis research, fostering a data-savvy workforce. Trainees will gain interdisciplinary skills, positioning them for careers in academia, industry, or policy. Sustainability will be ensured through institutional commitments (e.g., lab servers for hosting resources) and partnerships with data repositories. Ultimately, this work will catalyze a paradigm shift in how we approach emergence in biosciences, promoting collaborative, data-driven solutions to complex biological puzzles with enduring societal benefits.

Different from signaling or microbial ideas, it focuses on vesicle emergence, using diffusion models.

Cell communication experts, network analysts team up, supported by NCEMS. Outputs solve vesicle trafficking puzzles, with open sharing and training.",,"Background And Significance

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, represent a critical mechanism for intercellular communication in eukaryotic systems, facilitating the transfer of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules between cells. These vesicles are secreted by virtually all cell types and play pivotal roles in physiological processes such as immune response modulation, tissue repair, and developmental signaling, as well as pathological conditions including cancer metastasis, neurodegeneration, and viral propagation. Exosomes, a subset of EVs typically ranging from 30-150 nm in diameter, originate from the endosomal pathway and are released upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Their cargo is selectively sorted, involving complex molecular machinery such as the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, tetraspanins, and lipid rafts, which determine the specificity and functionality of the vesicles.

The field of EV research has exploded in recent decades, driven by advances in isolation techniques, high-throughput omics, and bioinformatics. Key databases like Vesiclepedia and ExoCarta have emerged as repositories for proteomic data, compiling information from thousands of studies across diverse biological contexts. Vesiclepedia, for instance, aggregates data from over 1,200 studies, encompassing more than 92,000 protein entries, while ExoCarta focuses specifically on exosomal proteins, with annotations from human, mouse, and other model organisms. These resources provide a wealth of publicly available data on EV proteomes, enabling synthesis efforts to uncover patterns not apparent in isolated experiments.

Literature highlights the significance of EVs in emergent phenomena, where simple interactions at the molecular level give rise to complex, system-level behaviors. For example, studies by Thery et al. (2009) in Nature Reviews Immunology demonstrated how exosomal cargo influences immune cell crosstalk, while Raposo and Stoorvogel (2013) in the Journal of Cell Biology elucidated the biogenesis and uptake mechanisms. More recent work, such as that by Jeppesen et al. (2019) in Cell, used advanced proteomics to refine EV subtypes, revealing distinct cargo profiles. Network-based approaches have begun to model EV-mediated interactions; for instance, Choi et al. (2017) in Scientific Reports applied graph theory to exosomal miRNA networks in cancer, showing emergent signaling hubs.

However, significant gaps persist. Current knowledge is fragmented, with most studies focusing on individual EV cargos or pairwise cell interactions, rather than holistic networks. Little is understood about how cargo sorting mechanisms lead to emergent communication networks at the tissue or organismal scale. For example, while ESCRT-dependent sorting is well-documented (Hurley, 2015, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology), the stochastic and context-dependent nature of this process and its role in generating diverse signaling outcomes remains underexplored. Traditional signaling models, such as those for cytokines or hormones, do not adequately capture the diffusive, cargo-laden nature of EV communication, which resembles diffusion-limited aggregation in physical systems.

Emergence in biological systems, as defined by Holland (1998) in 'Emergence: From Chaos to Order,' involves higher-level properties arising from lower-level interactions without central control. In EV contexts, this could manifest as self-organizing signaling networks where cargo sorting variability leads to robust, adaptive intercellular communication. Yet, synthesis of proteomic data to model such emergence is lacking. Microbial communication, like quorum sensing, has been modeled using diffusion equations (Waters and Bassler, 2005, Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology), but EV systems in eukaryotes present unique challenges due to multicellular complexity and cargo heterogeneity.

This research is timely amid the data explosion from initiatives like the Human Cell Atlas and the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium, which emphasize integrative approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored EVs' roles in viral spread and immune modulation (e.g., Sanwlani et al., 2021, Frontiers in Immunology), highlighting the need for predictive models of EV networks. Addressing these gaps through data synthesis aligns with NCEMS goals of tackling fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences via multidisciplinary collaboration. By integrating proteomic datasets, we can reveal how molecular-level cargo sorting emerges into cellular communication networks, solving long-standing puzzles in vesicle trafficking and intercellular signaling.

The importance lies in potential applications: understanding EV networks could inform therapeutic strategies, such as engineering exosomes for drug delivery (Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020, Science) or targeting them in diseases like Alzheimer's, where aberrant EV cargo contributes to pathology (Rajendran et al., 2006, PNAS). Limitations in current knowledge include the silos of data across studies, lack of standardized annotations, and insufficient computational models for emergence. Our proposal bridges these by fostering a transdisciplinary team of cell biologists, network theorists, and data scientists, leveraging public data to generate novel insights. This approach not only advances basic science but also trains a data-savvy workforce, promoting open science and inclusive collaboration across career stages and institutions. (712 words)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This proposal addresses fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biosciences by synthesizing proteomic data to explore emergent phenomena in extracellular vesicle (EV) communication. We focus on how selective cargo sorting in exosomes gives rise to intercellular signaling networks, using diffusion-based models to capture emergence. This differs from traditional signaling paradigms or microbial quorum sensing by emphasizing eukaryotic multicellular contexts and proteomic heterogeneity.

Specific Research Question 1: How does variability in exosomal cargo sorting mechanisms contribute to the emergence of robust intercellular communication networks? Sub-questions include: What are the key proteomic motifs (e.g., ESCRT proteins, tetraspanins) that drive sorting specificity across different cell types and conditions? How do these motifs interact to form higher-order patterns in EV proteomes?

Hypothesis 1: Variability in cargo sorting, driven by stochastic interactions of ESCRT complexes and lipid rafts, leads to emergent network topologies where certain proteins act as hubs, enhancing signaling robustness. Predictions: Integration of Vesiclepedia and ExoCarta data will reveal conserved sorting motifs in at least 70% of exosomal proteomes, with hub proteins (e.g., Alix, TSG101) showing higher connectivity in disease states compared to healthy ones. Expected outcomes: A catalog of sorting motifs and their network roles, validated against literature benchmarks.

Research Question 2: Can diffusion models simulate the propagation of EV-mediated signals to predict emergent network behaviors, such as feedback loops or synchronization in cellular populations? Sub-questions: How do diffusion coefficients, derived from proteomic cargo profiles, influence signal spread and network stability? What role does cargo heterogeneity play in generating adaptive responses?

Hypothesis 2: Diffusion models parameterized by proteomic data will predict that EV cargo sorting creates scale-free networks with emergent properties like resilience to perturbations, where removal of 10% of hub cargos disrupts signaling less than 20% in simulated tissues. Predictions: Models will show that high-heterogeneity cargos (e.g., those with variable phosphorylation states) foster synchronization in 80% of simulated scenarios, mirroring biological observations in wound healing. Deliverables: Open-source diffusion simulation software and validated network models.

Research Question 3: What methodological innovations in data synthesis and network analysis are needed to integrate disparate EV proteomic datasets for studying emergence? Sub-questions: How can we standardize annotations across Vesiclepedia and ExoCarta to enable cross-dataset comparisons? What novel algorithms can detect emergent patterns not visible in single datasets?

Hypothesis 3: A transdisciplinary synthesis approach, combining machine learning for data harmonization and graph diffusion algorithms, will uncover emergent communication motifs missed by traditional analyses, with at least a 30% increase in detected interactions. Predictions: Harmonized datasets will reveal novel cargo-sorting pathways, testable via in silico perturbations yielding predictions alignable with experimental literature (e.g., >90% accuracy in predicting known EV uptake mechanisms). Outcomes: Standardized protocols for EV data synthesis and a framework for future emergence studies.

Hypotheses will be tested through iterative data integration, computational modeling, and validation against independent datasets. For Hypothesis 1, we will use clustering algorithms on proteomic profiles to identify motifs, followed by network construction and centrality analysis. Validation involves comparing predicted hubs to experimental knockdown studies (e.g., from PubMed). For Hypothesis 2, diffusion models (e.g., based on reaction-diffusion equations) will be simulated using Python libraries like NetworkX and SciPy, with parameters fitted to proteomic abundances; outcomes validated by sensitivity analyses and comparison to real-world EV trafficking data. Hypothesis 3 testing includes developing custom scripts for data harmonization (e.g., ontology mapping) and applying community detection algorithms to reveal emergent structures, with rigor ensured via cross-validation and reproducibility checks.

Expected deliverables include peer-reviewed publications on emergent EV networks, open datasets with annotations, training modules for trainees, and a collaborative platform for ongoing synthesis. These will solve puzzles like how EVs coordinate multicellular responses without central control, advancing cellular biology by providing predictive models for emergent behaviors. The transdisciplinary approach ensures diverse insights, with questions designed to be novel yet grounded in data, fostering innovative strategies per NCEMS guidelines. (678 words)

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will exclusively utilize existing publicly available proteomic data from Vesiclepedia (version 2.1, containing over 1,200 studies with 92,000+ protein entries) and ExoCarta (latest release with 9,000+ exosomal proteins from human and model organisms). These datasets include mass spectrometry-derived proteomes from diverse sources, such as cancer cell lines, immune cells, and neural tissues, annotated with protein abundances, post-translational modifications, and cellular origins. No new experimental data will be generated; instead, we will integrate these datasets to model emergent EV communication networks.

The team comprises experts from at least three labs: cell communication biologists from Lab A (focusing on EV biogenesis), network analysts from Lab B (specializing in graph theory and systems biology), and computational modelers from Lab C (experienced in diffusion simulations). This collaboration exceeds single-lab capabilities, requiring diverse expertise for data harmonization, network construction, and modeling. NCEMS support is essential for coordinating virtual meetings, data infrastructure, and trainee involvement, as existing collaborations lack the scale for this synthesis.

Analytical methods begin with data preprocessing: We will download raw proteomic profiles using APIs from Vesiclepedia and ExoCarta, standardizing annotations via Gene Ontology (GO) and UniProt mappings to resolve inconsistencies (e.g., protein synonyms). Harmonization scripts in R (using biomaRt and clusterProfiler) will integrate datasets, filtering for high-confidence entries (>2 studies per protein) and normalizing abundances via log-transformation and z-scoring. This yields a unified dataset of ~50,000 unique EV proteins across 500+ conditions.

For network analysis, we will construct intercellular communication graphs where nodes represent cell types (inferred from dataset metadata) and edges denote EV-mediated interactions based on shared cargos. Edge weights will be calculated from proteomic overlap using Jaccard similarity, augmented by functional annotations (e.g., signaling pathways from Reactome). To model cargo sorting, we employ machine learning: Random Forest classifiers will predict sorting motifs from ESCRT/tetraspanin profiles, trained on 70% of the data and validated on 30% with ROC-AUC >0.85 as success criterion.

Emergence will be explored using diffusion models, adapting reaction-diffusion frameworks (Turing, 1952) to EV contexts. In Python (using NumPy, SciPy, and NetworkX), we simulate cargo propagation as diffusive processes: dC/dt = D ∇²C + f(S), where C is cargo concentration, D is diffusion coefficient (estimated from protein sizes and abundances), and f(S) represents sorting functions derived from proteomic data. Simulations will run on grid-based cellular arrays (100x100 cells) representing tissues, with parameters varied to test robustness (e.g., noise in sorting added via Gaussian perturbations). Controls include null models (random cargo distributions) and benchmarks against literature (e.g., matching diffusion rates to observed EV uptake times ~hours).

No physical experiments are involved, but in silico replicates (n=100 per scenario) ensure statistical power. Timeline: Year 1 (Months 1-6): Data acquisition and harmonization (Milestone: Unified dataset released openly). Months 7-12: Network construction and motif identification (Milestone: Preliminary models and trainee workshop). Year 2 (Months 13-18): Diffusion simulations and hypothesis testing (Milestone: Validated network predictions). Months 19-24: Integration, validation, and refinement (Milestone: Final models and publications). Bi-monthly virtual meetings via NCEMS platforms will track progress, with agile adjustments based on interim results.

Statistical plans include ANOVA for comparing network metrics (e.g., degree distribution) across conditions, with Bonferroni corrections for multiple tests. Machine learning models will use cross-validation (k=10) and permutation tests for significance (p<0.05). Sensitivity analyses will assess model robustness to parameter variations (±20%). All workflows will be version-controlled on GitHub, adhering to open science: Data, code, and results shared via Zenodo under CC-BY licenses, with FAIR principles ensured.

Training integrates graduate students and postdocs (at least 4 per lab) through hands-on tasks like data curation and modeling, plus annual workshops on synthesis methods. This fosters a data-savvy workforce. The approach's rigor is ensured by diverse expertise, reproducibility, and alignment with NCEMS requirements for transdisciplinary, collaborative synthesis beyond single-lab scope. (862 words)

Intended contributions address long-standing puzzles, such as the stochastic nature of vesicle trafficking leading to adaptive networks. By revealing proteomic hubs and diffusion-driven emergence, we provide a framework for understanding phenomena like tissue homeostasis or cancer invasion, where EVs coordinate collective behaviors. This advances the field beyond descriptive proteomics toward predictive, systems-level models, fostering innovative analytical strategies as per NCEMS goals.

Broader impacts extend to biomedicine: Insights into EV networks could guide targeted therapies, e.g., disrupting pathological cargos in neurodegenerative diseases (as in Alzheimer's, where amyloid-beta propagates via EVs). In regenerative medicine, models might optimize exosome-based delivery systems for precision therapeutics. Societally, by leveraging public data, we democratize access to synthesis research, promoting equity in science. The transdisciplinary collaboration will stimulate new partnerships, uniting biologists, modelers, and data scientists across institutions, geographies (e.g., US, Europe), and career stages, including underrepresented groups.

Potential for follow-up includes extending models to multi-omics data (e.g., integrating transcriptomics) or applying them to specific diseases via grants from NIH or ERC. Collaborations could expand to industry partners for therapeutic validation, sustaining the working group beyond funding. Long-term vision: Establish a global consortium for EV synthesis research, with our tools as foundational resources, enduring through open platforms and community updates.

Dissemination plans emphasize open science: All outputs will be shared immediately via preprint servers (bioRxiv), with final versions in open-access journals. We will present at conferences like the American Society for Cell Biology and International Society for Extracellular Vesicles, hosting webinars for broader audiences. A dedicated website will host interactive models, enabling user-driven simulations.

Sustainability is ensured by designing modular, extensible tools (e.g., Python packages) that can be maintained by the community post-funding. Training efforts will create a pipeline of experts, perpetuating synthesis approaches. Overall, this project catalyzes a paradigm shift in studying emergence, with ripple effects enhancing cellular biology, fostering inclusive science, and addressing real-world health challenges through data-driven innovation.

Aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by the progressive decline in physiological function, leading to increased vulnerability to disease and death. At the molecular and cellular levels, aging manifests through phenomena such as cellular senescence, where cells enter a state of permanent growth arrest, secreting pro-inflammatory factors that contribute to tissue dysfunction. Understanding how these molecular changes accumulate and give rise to emergent aging phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in the molecular and cellular biosciences. Emergence phenomena refer to the appearance of complex behaviors or properties at higher levels of organization that are not predictable from the individual components alone. In the context of aging, emergent senescence phenotypes arise from the integration of diverse molecular signals, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic alterations, which collectively drive systemic aging outcomes like frailty, chronic inflammation, and reduced regenerative capacity.

The current state of the field in aging research has been revolutionized by high-throughput omics technologies, generating vast amounts of publicly available data. Resources such as the Aging Atlas, a comprehensive repository of multi-omics data from aging studies across species, and GenAge, a curated database of genes associated with longevity and aging, provide unprecedented opportunities for data synthesis. These datasets include longitudinal profiles of gene expression, DNA methylation patterns, protein abundance, and metabolite levels in aging tissues from model organisms like mice, worms, and humans. Recent advancements have highlighted key molecular hallmarks of aging, as outlined by López-Otín et al. (2013) in their seminal review, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. However, most studies focus on isolated hallmarks or single-omics layers, limiting insights into how these interact to produce emergent phenotypes.

A detailed literature review reveals significant progress in related areas. For instance, studies by Hannum et al. (2013) developed epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation data to predict chronological age, demonstrating correlations with biological aging rates. Similarly, the GenAge database has been instrumental in identifying conserved longevity genes, as explored by Tacutu et al. (2018), who integrated it with other resources to model aging networks. Longitudinal studies, such as those from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, have provided time-series data on physiological changes, but synthesis across datasets remains sparse. Work by Zhang et al. (2020) in the Aging Atlas project integrated transcriptomic data to reveal age-related gene expression patterns, yet these efforts often overlook the emergent properties arising from multi-omics integration. In contrast, research on cellular differentiation, such as single-cell RNA-seq analyses by Trapnell et al. (2014), has successfully modeled emergent cell fates, but aging research lags in applying similar synthesis approaches to senescence.

Key gaps and limitations persist in current knowledge. First, there is a lack of integrated models that capture the longitudinal accumulation of molecular changes into emergent senescence phenotypes, such as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Most analyses are cross-sectional, failing to account for temporal dynamics. Second, heterogeneity in aging trajectories— influenced by genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors—is underexplored in synthesized datasets. Third, while individual labs have analyzed subsets of these data, the scale and diversity required for comprehensive synthesis exceed single-lab capabilities, necessitating multidisciplinary collaboration. For example, gerontologists provide biological context, demographers offer population-level insights on longevity, and data scientists contribute advanced modeling techniques. Existing puzzles, like why certain molecular interventions extend lifespan in models but not humans, remain unsolved due to fragmented data integration.

This research is important and timely because it addresses the urgent need to unravel aging enigmas amid a global aging population, projected to reach 2.1 billion people over 60 by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). By synthesizing publicly available data, we can generate novel insights into emergence phenomena without generating new data, aligning with sustainable research practices. The timing is opportune given the explosion of open-access omics repositories and advancements in AI-driven analytics, enabling predictive modeling of aging phenotypes. This project will bridge gaps by focusing on longevity emergence, distinct from differentiation or heterogeneity studies, and foster transdisciplinary teams to innovate research strategies. Ultimately, it promises to advance molecular and cellular sciences by revealing how molecular perturbations scale to cellular and organismal levels, potentially informing interventions for age-related diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. By training a data-savvy workforce and adhering to open science, it will catalyze broader scientific progress. (Word count: 712)

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is designed to address compelling scientific questions in molecular and cellular biology through the integration of publicly available aging omics data. By focusing on emergent cellular senescence phenotypes, we aim to uncover how molecular changes accumulate over time to produce complex aging outcomes, such as increased senescence and reduced longevity. Unlike prior focuses on cellular differentiation or population heterogeneity, our emphasis is on the emergence of longevity-related traits through longitudinal modeling. This collaborative effort will involve gerontologists, demographers, and data scientists, leveraging NCEMS resources to synthesize data beyond single-lab capacities.

Specific research questions include: 1) How do multi-omics molecular changes (e.g., transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic) interact longitudinally to drive the emergence of cellular senescence phenotypes? This question targets the temporal dynamics of senescence markers like p16INK4a expression and SASP factors, integrating data from Aging Atlas and GenAge to model accumulation patterns. 2) What are the key predictive molecular signatures that distinguish emergent senescence from normal aging processes, and how do these vary across species and tissues? This explores cross-species conservation and tissue-specificity, addressing puzzles like why senescence accelerates in certain organs. 3) Can integrated models predict longevity outcomes based on early molecular perturbations, and what methodological innovations are needed for robust synthesis? This question focuses on developing novel analytical strategies for data integration, aiming to solve long-standing enigmas in aging, such as the disconnect between molecular hallmarks and phenotypic outcomes.

Testable hypotheses are formulated with clear predictions. Hypothesis 1: Longitudinal integration of epigenomic and transcriptomic data will reveal emergent senescence networks where cumulative changes in DNA methylation and gene expression predict SASP activation with greater accuracy than single-omics models. Prediction: Models incorporating time-series data will achieve >80% accuracy in classifying senescent cells, validated against known senescence datasets. Hypothesis 2: Conserved longevity genes from GenAge, when synthesized with Aging Atlas multi-omics profiles, will identify tissue-specific emergent phenotypes that correlate with lifespan extension in model organisms. Prediction: Network analysis will uncover hubs (e.g., SIRT1 or mTOR pathways) where perturbations extend virtual lifespan simulations by 20-30%, testable via in silico perturbations. Hypothesis 3: Demographic modeling of population-level aging data, integrated with cellular omics, will demonstrate that stochastic molecular heterogeneity contributes to emergent variability in senescence phenotypes. Prediction: Stochastic simulations will show that 40-60% of phenotype variance arises from integrated molecular noise, compared to deterministic models.

Expected outcomes include: (a) A comprehensive database of integrated aging omics with emergent phenotype predictors, publicly available for community use; (b) Novel analytical tools, such as machine learning-based longitudinal models for senescence prediction; (c) Peer-reviewed publications detailing synthesis methods and findings; (d) Training modules for trainees in data synthesis. Deliverables encompass quarterly progress reports, a final synthesis report, and open-source code repositories.

Hypotheses will be tested and validated through a rigorous, iterative process. For Hypothesis 1, we will employ longitudinal modeling techniques like hidden Markov models to integrate time-series data, validating predictions against independent datasets from sources like the Human Ageing Genomic Resources. Cross-validation will ensure model robustness, with statistical significance assessed via permutation tests (p<0.05). Hypothesis 2 will use graph-based network synthesis, perturbing nodes in silico and comparing outcomes to empirical longevity data, with validation through meta-analysis of existing studies. Hypothesis 3 will integrate demographic models (e.g., Gompertz-Makeham) with stochastic differential equations, validating against real-world cohort data. All tests will incorporate controls for data biases, such as batch effects, and replicates via bootstrapping. This approach ensures scientific rigor, fostering innovative insights into aging emergence while training the next generation through collaborative working groups. (Word count: 678)

Cellular stress memory represents a fundamental yet poorly understood phenomenon where prior exposure to environmental challenges alters subsequent cellular responses, often conferring adaptive advantages. This phenomenon has been documented across all domains of life, from bacterial persistence to mammalian immune training, yet our understanding remains fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. The molecular mechanisms that encode, maintain, and retrieve these memories operate across multiple timescales—from minutes to generations—and involve complex interactions between epigenetic modifications, metabolic reprogramming, and protein homeostasis networks. Despite decades of research on individual stress responses, we lack a unified framework for understanding how cells integrate environmental history into their molecular architecture.

Recent advances have revealed that stress memory is not merely a passive consequence of incomplete recovery but an active cellular strategy. In yeast, heat shock priming enhances thermotolerance for hours through maintained expression of heat shock proteins and altered chromatin states at stress-responsive genes. In plants, drought priming can persist through mitotic divisions via histone modifications and small RNA pathways, enabling faster stomatal closure upon subsequent water limitation. Mammalian cells exhibit trained immunity, where innate immune cells exposed to pathogens or metabolic signals show enhanced responses weeks later through epigenetic reprogramming at inflammatory gene loci. These observations suggest conserved principles of cellular memory that transcend specific stressors and organisms.

However, current research faces critical limitations. First, studies typically focus on single stressor types within single model systems, preventing identification of universal versus context-specific memory mechanisms. Second, most investigations examine limited molecular layers—either transcriptomics or epigenomics—missing the multi-layered nature of memory encoding. Third, temporal resolution is often inadequate to distinguish immediate stress responses from persistent memory states. Fourth, the field lacks quantitative frameworks to measure memory capacity, fidelity, and decay kinetics across molecular networks. Finally, we cannot predict which stresses will generate lasting memories versus transient responses, limiting our ability to harness stress memory for practical applications.

The significance of understanding cellular stress memory extends far beyond basic biology. In agriculture, stress priming could enhance crop resilience to climate variability without genetic modification. In medicine, understanding trained immunity mechanisms could improve vaccine efficacy and cancer immunotherapy. In biotechnology, engineered stress memory could optimize microbial production strains. Conversely, maladaptive stress memories contribute to aging, metabolic disease, and transgenerational trauma effects. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how viral stress triggers long-lasting immune and metabolic changes, underscoring the clinical relevance of stress memory mechanisms.

This proposal addresses these gaps through comprehensive synthesis of existing multi-omics datasets spanning diverse stressors, timescales, and evolutionary lineages. The explosive growth of publicly available omics data—with over 5 million samples in GEO alone—provides unprecedented opportunities for synthesis research. Critically, stress-response datasets often include temporal sampling and recovery phases, enabling memory analysis when integrated systematically. However, these data remain siloed across repositories, experimental systems, and molecular modalities. No individual laboratory possesses the expertise to integrate epigenomics, metabolomics, stress physiology, and information theory required to decode cellular memory mechanisms comprehensively.

The timing is optimal for this synthesis effort. Computational tools for multi-omics integration have matured, including methods for batch correction across studies, imputation of missing data modalities, and causal inference from temporal data. Information theory provides rigorous frameworks for quantifying memory in biological systems, recently applied to neural networks and gene regulatory circuits but not yet to stress memory. Comparative genomics approaches can now identify conserved regulatory elements across distant species. Machine learning enables pattern discovery in high-dimensional temporal data. By assembling a transdisciplinary team spanning epigenetics, stress biology, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and theoretical biology, we can synthesize fragmented knowledge into a unified understanding of how cells encode environmental history at the molecular level.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our fundamental understanding of cellular stress memory mechanisms.

Research Question 1: What are the temporal dynamics and molecular signatures of stress memory across different stressor types and biological systems? We hypothesize that stress memories exhibit characteristic temporal profiles that depend on the molecular layer (epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolic, proteomic) and can be classified into distinct memory classes based on persistence duration. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, repressive histone marks) encode the longest-lasting memories (days to weeks), while metabolic changes represent shorter-term memories (hours to days). (H1b) Stress memory duration correlates with the energetic cost of the initial stress response, with severe stresses producing longer-lasting molecular imprints. (H1c) Memory signatures cluster into conserved modules across evolutionarily distant organisms (yeast, Arabidopsis, mammalian cells), indicating fundamental memory-encoding principles. We will test these hypotheses by extracting temporal profiles from time-series datasets that include stress exposure, removal, and recovery phases. By applying dynamic time warping and hierarchical clustering to normalized molecular trajectories, we will identify memory signatures that persist significantly longer than the immediate stress response. Cross-species comparative analysis will reveal conserved versus lineage-specific memory mechanisms.

Research Question 2: What molecular mechanisms determine memory stability versus erasure, and how do cells regulate memory maintenance? We hypothesize that memory stability depends on self-reinforcing feedback loops involving chromatin modifications, transcription factors, and metabolic states that create bistable molecular switches. We predict that: (H2a) Stable memories involve positive feedback between histone modifications and transcription factor binding at memory loci, creating epigenetic bistability. (H2b) Memory erasure requires active mechanisms (demethylases, histone erasers, protein degradation) rather than passive dilution, with erasure rates varying systematically across memory types. (H2c) Metabolic intermediates, particularly acetyl-CoA and SAM (S-adenosylmethionine), serve as memory stabilizers by sustaining chromatin-modifying enzyme activity. (H2d) Long non-coding RNAs and RNA modifications contribute to memory maintenance through scaffolding of chromatin complexes. We will test these hypotheses using time-lagged correlation analysis and Granger causality testing on integrated multi-omics datasets to identify directional relationships between molecular layers. Network analysis will reveal feedback motifs associated with memory persistence. Comparative analysis of datasets with and without specific erasure mechanisms (e.g., demethylase knockouts) will validate erasure requirements.

Research Question 3: How do cells integrate multiple sequential or simultaneous stress exposures, and what determines memory interference versus synergy? We hypothesize that cellular memory systems exhibit limited capacity, leading to competition between memories, but that mechanistically distinct stresses can be encoded in parallel through orthogonal molecular pathways. We predict that: (H3a) Sequential exposure to similar stresses (e.g., two heat shocks) produces memory reinforcement with extended duration, while dissimilar stresses (e.g., heat then oxidative stress) show memory interference with shortened persistence. (H3b) The number of simultaneously maintainable memories is constrained by availability of epigenetic marks and metabolic cofactors, with information-theoretic capacity limits of 3-5 distinct stress memories per cell type. (H3c) Stress memory integration follows hierarchical rules, with survival-critical stresses (hypoxia, severe oxidative damage) overwriting memories of milder stresses. (H3d) Chromatin compartmentalization enables parallel memory storage, with different stress memories encoded in distinct nuclear domains. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing datasets involving sequential or combined stress exposures, comparing molecular trajectories to single-stress controls. Information-theoretic analysis will quantify memory capacity by measuring mutual information between stress history and molecular states. Machine learning classifiers will determine how accurately past stress exposures can be decoded from molecular profiles, providing a functional measure of memory fidelity.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A comprehensive stress memory atlas cataloging molecular signatures across 50+ stressor-organism combinations with temporal resolution. (2) Quantitative models predicting memory formation probability, persistence duration, and decay kinetics from stress parameters and initial molecular responses. (3) Identification of master regulators and core pathways essential for memory encoding across systems. (4) Information-theoretic metrics for cellular memory capacity applicable across biological contexts. (5) Mechanistic insights into memory interference and integration rules. (6) Validated computational pipelines for temporal multi-omics integration applicable to other biological questions. These outcomes will be validated through consistency across independent datasets, agreement with mechanistic perturbation studies in the literature, and predictive accuracy when tested on held-out datasets. The synthesis approach enables hypothesis testing at scales impossible for individual laboratories, leveraging the collective investment in stress biology research to extract emergent principles of cellular memory.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates four complementary methodological strategies: systematic data aggregation and harmonization, temporal multi-omics integration, information-theoretic analysis, and comparative evolutionary analysis. This work will be conducted over 36 months with specific milestones and deliverables.

Data Sources and Aggregation (Months 1-6): We will systematically identify and curate datasets from multiple public repositories. From Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress, we will extract time-series transcriptomic datasets (RNA-seq, microarray) involving stress exposure and recovery phases across Saccharomyces cerevisiae (target: 150+ datasets), Arabidopsis thaliana (100+ datasets), and mammalian cell lines/tissues (200+ datasets) exposed to heat shock, oxidative stress (H2O2, paraquat), hypoxia, nutrient limitation, osmotic stress, and DNA damage. From ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics, we will obtain chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq), histone modification ChIP-seq (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3), and DNA methylation (WGBS, RRBS) data for stress-exposed mammalian cells. From MetaboLights and Metabolomics Workbench, we will compile metabolomic profiles (LC-MS, GC-MS) from stressed cells. From proteomics repositories (PRIDE, ProteomeXchange), we will extract protein abundance and post-translational modification data. We will develop automated pipelines using custom Python scripts and the GEOquery R package to download, parse metadata, and filter for studies meeting quality criteria (biological replicates, temporal sampling, documented stress conditions). A relational database will organize datasets by organism, stressor type, molecular modality, and temporal coverage.

Data Harmonization and Quality Control (Months 4-9): Raw data will be reprocessed using standardized pipelines to ensure comparability. RNA-seq data will be aligned using STAR, quantified with RSEM, and normalized using DESeq2 with batch correction via ComBat-seq. Microarray data will be normalized using RMA and batch-corrected. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data will be processed using the ENCODE pipeline (BWA alignment, MACS2 peak calling, IDR filtering). DNA methylation data will be processed using Bismark with consistent filtering thresholds. Metabolomics data will be normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization and aligned across studies using retention time correction. We will implement rigorous quality control, removing samples with low read depth, poor replicate correlation (r<0.8), or anomalous distributions. Missing data modalities will be imputed using MOFA+ (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis), which learns shared latent factors across data types.

Temporal Pattern Analysis (Months 7-15): We will develop novel analytical frameworks for identifying memory signatures. For each dataset, we will define the ""acute response phase"" (during stress) and ""memory phase"" (post-stress recovery). Memory signatures are molecular features (genes, peaks, metabolites) showing sustained deviation from baseline beyond the acute phase. We will apply change-point detection algorithms (Bayesian change-point analysis, PELT) to identify when molecular features return to baseline versus persist. Dynamic time warping will align temporal trajectories across studies with different sampling intervals. Hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps will group features by temporal dynamics. We will calculate memory persistence scores as the area under the curve of normalized deviation during recovery. Statistical significance will be assessed using permutation tests comparing observed persistence to randomized temporal orderings.

Multi-Omics Integration (Months 10-20): We will integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic layers to identify cross-layer memory mechanisms. Time-lagged cross-correlation analysis will reveal directional relationships (e.g., histone modifications preceding transcriptional changes). We will apply Granger causality testing adapted for biological time series to infer causal relationships between molecular layers. Multi-omics network analysis using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) extended to multi-layer networks will identify modules showing coordinated memory dynamics. We will map metabolic changes to chromatin-modifying enzyme cofactors (acetyl-CoA for acetylation, SAM for methylation) to test metabolic memory hypotheses. Regulatory network reconstruction using ARACNe and GENIE3 will identify transcription factors and chromatin regulators as memory master regulators.

Information-Theoretic Analysis (Months 12-24): We will quantify cellular memory capacity using information theory. Mutual information I(S;M) between stress history S and molecular state M will measure how much information about past stresses is encoded in current molecular profiles. We will calculate this using k-nearest neighbor entropy estimators suitable for continuous multi-dimensional data. Memory capacity will be quantified as the maximum number of distinct stress histories distinguishable from molecular states, using machine learning classifiers (random forests, support vector machines) trained to decode stress history from molecular profiles. Classification accuracy provides a functional measure of memory fidelity. We will calculate memory decay rates by fitting exponential models to time-dependent mutual information. Transfer entropy will quantify information flow between molecular layers during memory formation and maintenance.

Comparative Evolutionary Analysis (Months 15-27): We will identify conserved memory mechanisms across yeast, plants, and mammals using comparative genomics. Orthologous genes showing memory dynamics across species will be identified using OrthoFinder. Conserved regulatory elements in memory gene promoters will be detected using MEME Suite motif discovery. Phylogenetic profiling will determine whether memory mechanisms correlate with environmental variability in species' natural habitats. We will test whether memory capacity scales with genome complexity and epigenetic machinery diversity.

Model Development and Validation (Months 20-30): We will develop predictive models for memory formation and persistence using machine learning. Features include stress intensity, duration, molecular responses during acute phase, and baseline chromatin states. Models will be trained on 70% of datasets and validated on held-out 30%. We will develop mechanistic ordinary differential equation models of memory circuits incorporating feedback loops identified through network analysis. Model predictions will be compared against independent validation datasets not used in model training.

Tool Development and Dissemination (Months 24-36): We will create open-source R/Python packages for temporal multi-omics analysis, including functions for memory signature detection, time-lagged correlation analysis, and information-theoretic metrics. Interactive web portals will enable community exploration of the stress memory atlas. All code will be version-controlled on GitHub with comprehensive documentation. We will develop training modules including video tutorials, Jupyter notebooks with worked examples, and workshop materials for teaching temporal multi-omics analysis.

Timeline Milestones: Month 6: Database populated with 500+ curated datasets. Month 12: Harmonized data matrices completed; initial memory signatures identified. Month 18: Multi-omics integration analysis completed; candidate memory mechanisms identified. Month 24: Information-theoretic analysis completed; memory capacity quantified. Month 30: Predictive models validated; comparative analysis completed. Month 36: Stress memory atlas published; tools released; manuscripts submitted.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes advancing molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for understanding cellular adaptation and memory.

Primary Scientific Outcomes: The Stress Memory Atlas will represent the first comprehensive catalog of molecular memory signatures across stressor types, organisms, and timescales. This resource will map the temporal dynamics of epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolic, and proteomic changes for 50+ stress conditions, providing the community with quantitative benchmarks for memory persistence (half-lives ranging from hours to weeks) and identifying approximately 200-500 core memory genes conserved across eukaryotes. The atlas will reveal that cellular memory is not monolithic but comprises distinct memory classes: short-term metabolic memories (hours), intermediate transcriptional memories (days), and long-term epigenetic memories (weeks to transgenerational). This classification will fundamentally reshape how we conceptualize cellular adaptation.

Our mechanistic discoveries will identify master regulators of memory formation and maintenance, including specific histone-modifying enzymes, metabolic checkpoints, and transcription factor networks that determine whether stress responses become persistent memories. We predict discovering 10-20 previously unrecognized memory regulators whose perturbation in existing datasets correlates with altered memory dynamics. The identification of self-reinforcing feedback loops creating epigenetic bistability will provide mechanistic explanations for memory persistence and reveal therapeutic targets for erasing maladaptive memories or enhancing beneficial priming.

The information-theoretic framework will establish quantitative principles of cellular memory capacity, revealing fundamental limits on how many distinct environmental experiences cells can simultaneously encode. We expect to demonstrate that memory capacity scales with epigenetic machinery complexity and that capacity constraints explain memory interference phenomena. These findings will establish cellular memory as a quantifiable information processing function, bridging molecular biology and cognitive science concepts.

Predictive models will enable researchers to forecast memory formation probability and persistence duration from measurable stress parameters and early molecular responses, transforming stress memory from a descriptive to a predictive science. These models will achieve >80% accuracy in classifying whether a given stress will produce lasting memory, enabling rational design of priming protocols.

Computational and Methodological Innovations: Our open-source analytical tools will enable the broader community to apply temporal multi-omics integration to other biological questions involving cellular state transitions, differentiation, and disease progression. The MemoryOmics R package will include functions for memory signature detection, time-lagged causal inference, and information-theoretic analysis, with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. We anticipate these tools will be adopted by researchers studying cellular plasticity, trained immunity, stem cell differentiation, and cancer cell state transitions, catalyzing methodological advances beyond stress biology.

Broader Impacts and Applications: In agriculture, our findings will inform precision priming strategies to enhance crop stress resilience. By identifying optimal priming protocols (stressor type, intensity, timing) that maximize memory duration without fitness costs, we will enable development of non-transgenic approaches to climate adaptation. Our models will predict which crop varieties possess greater memory capacity based on epigenetic machinery, guiding breeding programs. We will partner with agricultural research institutions to translate findings into field applications.

In medicine, understanding trained immunity mechanisms will inform vaccine adjuvant design and immunotherapy protocols. Our identification of metabolic and epigenetic memory stabilizers will reveal druggable targets for enhancing beneficial immune memory or erasing pathological memories in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. The discovery that maladaptive stress memories contribute to aging and metabolic disease will open therapeutic avenues for memory erasure interventions.

In biotechnology, engineered stress memory could optimize industrial microorganisms by pre-conditioning them for production environments, improving yield and robustness. Our mechanistic insights will enable synthetic biology approaches to design artificial memory circuits with specified persistence and capacity.

Training and Workforce Development: This project will train 6-8 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in cutting-edge synthesis research, multi-omics integration, and quantitative biology. Trainees will gain expertise spanning molecular biology, bioinformatics, and theoretical approaches—skill sets increasingly demanded in academia, industry, and government. We will develop a comprehensive training curriculum including: (1) Intensive workshops on temporal omics analysis and information theory applications in biology. (2) Collaborative research rotations where trainees work across participating laboratories, building interdisciplinary networks. (3) Open online courses making training materials available globally, democratizing access to synthesis research skills. (4) Mentorship in open science practices, reproducible workflows, and science communication. We will prioritize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and primarily undergraduate institutions, partnering with diversity-focused programs.

Dissemination and Community Engagement: We will publish findings in high-impact journals (Nature, Science, Cell) and discipline-specific venues, with all publications open access. Preprints will be posted immediately upon manuscript completion. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be deposited in public repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, Dryad) following FAIR principles. We will present findings at major conferences (ASCB, Keystone Symposia, Plant Biology) and organize symposia bringing together stress biology, epigenetics, and computational biology communities. An interactive web portal will enable community exploration of the stress memory atlas with visualization tools for querying specific genes, stressors, or organisms. We will establish a user forum for community feedback and feature requests, ensuring tools meet researcher needs.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes stress memory as a quantitative discipline with rigorous theoretical foundations and predictive capabilities. The atlas and tools will remain valuable resources requiring ongoing maintenance and updates as new datasets emerge. We will pursue follow-up funding to expand the atlas to additional organisms (fungi, protists, human tissues) and stressors (pathogens, toxins), and to experimentally validate predictions in model systems. The collaborative network established will continue generating synthesis projects addressing related questions about cellular plasticity and adaptation. By demonstrating the power of synthesis research in molecular and cellular biology, this project will inspire similar community-scale efforts addressing other fundamental questions, advancing the field toward data-driven, integrative understanding of cellular function.

The computational infrastructure for petabyte-scale data processing exceeds typical laboratory resources. The development of community resources (atlas, tools, training materials) requires sustained support beyond grant cycles typically available to individual investigators. NCEMS catalytic support will enable this team to address fundamental questions about cellular memory that have remained intractable due to disciplinary fragmentation and data siloing. The collaborative framework, shared resources, and training opportunities provided by NCEMS are essential for this synthesis effort to succeed and deliver transformative insights into how cells encode environmental history.",,

This synthesis project will integrate single-cell RNA-seq, single-molecule imaging data, protein abundance distributions, lineage tracing, and phenotypic profiling datasets to understand how molecular stochasticity generates functional cellular heterogeneity. By bringing together systems biologists, biophysicists, statisticians, and cell biologists, we will analyze noise propagation from transcription through protein expression to cellular phenotypes across diverse cell types and organisms. The project will synthesize data from single-cell atlases, noise measurement studies, cell fate decision datasets, and bacterial/yeast population dynamics to address: What molecular features determine noise levels? How is stochasticity filtered or amplified through regulatory networks? When is noise functional versus detrimental? We will develop statistical frameworks to decompose phenotypic variance into molecular sources, apply stochastic modeling to predict noise propagation, and identify network motifs that control variability. This addresses fundamental questions about biological individuality and decision-making that require integration of single-cell genomics, quantitative imaging, mathematical modeling, and population-level phenotyping—expertise rarely combined. The synthesis demands computational infrastructure for analyzing millions of single-cell profiles alongside biophysical models of stochastic processes. Outputs include a cellular noise atlas quantifying variability across genes and conditions, predictive tools for noise propagation, standardized analysis workflows for stochastic systems, and interdisciplinary training in quantitative single-cell biology. This work will reveal design principles of biological noise management and inform synthetic biology applications requiring controlled heterogeneity.",,"Background And Significance

The fundamental question of how genetically identical cells generate diverse phenotypes has captivated biologists since the earliest observations of cellular heterogeneity. This phenomenon, termed cellular individuality, underlies critical biological processes including cell fate determination, bet-hedging strategies in microbial populations, drug resistance in cancer, and immune cell activation. Despite decades of research demonstrating that stochastic gene expression—random fluctuations in molecular processes—drives much of this heterogeneity, we lack comprehensive frameworks that connect molecular noise to functional cellular outcomes across biological systems.

The field of stochastic gene expression emerged from pioneering work showing that gene expression is inherently noisy due to the small numbers of molecules involved in transcription and translation. Early studies in bacterial and yeast systems quantified intrinsic noise (arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions at individual gene loci) and extrinsic noise (arising from cell-to-cell differences in cellular components). Single-molecule imaging techniques revealed transcriptional bursting—the episodic production of mRNA in discrete pulses—as a universal feature of gene expression. These discoveries established that noise is not merely biological imprecision but a fundamental property of molecular systems that cells must manage.

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized our ability to measure gene expression heterogeneity at unprecedented scale, generating atlases containing millions of cellular profiles across tissues, developmental stages, and disease states. Simultaneously, advances in live-cell imaging, single-molecule FISH, and mass cytometry have enabled quantification of protein abundance distributions and temporal dynamics in individual cells. Lineage tracing technologies now allow tracking of cellular decisions and fates over time, while high-throughput phenotypic profiling can measure functional consequences of molecular variability. However, these rich datasets remain largely siloed within their respective communities, analyzed with discipline-specific approaches that fail to capture the multi-scale nature of noise propagation from genes to phenotypes.

Current limitations in understanding cellular individuality stem from several critical gaps. First, we lack systematic characterization of noise levels across genes, cell types, and organisms. While individual studies have measured variability in specific systems, no comprehensive atlas exists to identify universal principles versus context-specific patterns. Second, the relationship between transcriptional noise and protein-level variability remains poorly understood, with conflicting reports about whether post-transcriptional processes amplify or buffer noise. Third, we cannot predict how noise propagates through regulatory networks—whether specific network motifs filter stochasticity or amplify it for functional purposes. Fourth, the functional consequences of noise remain debated: when does heterogeneity provide adaptive advantages versus representing unavoidable molecular imprecision that cells must tolerate?

These gaps persist because addressing them requires integrating diverse data types and analytical approaches that span multiple disciplines. Single-cell genomics provides snapshots of molecular states but lacks temporal resolution. Live-cell imaging captures dynamics but in limited numbers of cells and genes. Biophysical models can predict noise propagation but require experimental validation across conditions. Population-level phenotyping reveals functional outcomes but cannot easily be linked to underlying molecular sources. No individual laboratory possesses the expertise, data access, and computational resources to synthesize these complementary perspectives.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the explosion of publicly available single-cell datasets provides unprecedented opportunities for meta-analysis across studies, cell types, and organisms. Major repositories including GEO, ArrayExpress, and the Human Cell Atlas contain thousands of single-cell RNA-seq experiments. Second, standardized noise measurement datasets from systematic studies in model organisms enable comparative analysis. Third, computational advances in stochastic modeling and statistical inference now allow rigorous decomposition of variance sources and prediction of noise propagation. Fourth, emerging applications in synthetic biology, cellular engineering, and precision medicine require understanding and controlling cellular heterogeneity, making this fundamental research immediately relevant.

Addressing the molecular basis of cellular individuality will transform our understanding of biological systems. It will reveal design principles governing how evolution has shaped noise management strategies, inform predictions about cellular decision-making in development and disease, and enable rational engineering of heterogeneity for biotechnology applications. This synthesis project uniquely positions us to integrate fragmented knowledge into comprehensive frameworks that span molecular mechanisms to cellular phenotypes.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our understanding of cellular individuality.

Research Question 1: What molecular and regulatory features determine noise levels in gene expression across cell types and organisms? We hypothesize that noise levels are predictable from gene-specific features including promoter architecture, chromatin state, transcription factor binding dynamics, mRNA stability, and translation efficiency. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) genes with TATA-box promoters exhibit higher transcriptional noise than TATA-less promoters across eukaryotic systems due to differences in bursting kinetics; (H1b) genes with shorter mRNA half-lives show higher protein noise due to reduced temporal averaging; (H1c) highly expressed genes exhibit lower relative noise following a power-law relationship consistent with molecular counting statistics; and (H1d) noise levels are conserved for orthologous genes across species when normalized for expression level, suggesting evolutionary constraint on variability. We will test these hypotheses by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with genomic annotations, chromatin accessibility data, mRNA decay measurements, and ribosome profiling datasets. We will develop machine learning models to predict noise from molecular features and validate predictions against independent noise measurement datasets. Expected outcomes include quantitative relationships between molecular features and noise levels, identification of noise-determining sequence elements, and predictive models applicable to any gene in characterized cell types.

Research Question 2: How is molecular stochasticity filtered, amplified, or transformed as it propagates from transcription through translation to cellular phenotypes? We hypothesize that regulatory network architecture determines noise transmission, with specific network motifs serving as noise filters or amplifiers. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) negative feedback loops reduce noise in regulated genes compared to unregulated genes with similar expression levels; (H2b) feedforward loops with AND-gate logic filter noise while OR-gate logic amplifies it; (H2c) post-transcriptional regulation through microRNAs buffers protein noise relative to mRNA noise; (H2d) multi-stage regulatory cascades progressively filter noise unless positive feedback is present; and (H2e) phenotypic noise is lower than expected from molecular noise alone due to cellular averaging over multiple molecular species. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing paired mRNA-protein measurements, reconstructing regulatory networks from ChIP-seq and perturbation data, applying stochastic simulation algorithms to network models, and comparing predicted versus observed noise propagation. We will leverage datasets containing simultaneous measurements of transcripts and proteins (REAP-seq, CITE-seq) and time-series data capturing regulatory dynamics. Expected outcomes include quantitative rules for noise transmission through regulatory motifs, identification of noise-buffering versus noise-amplifying network architectures, and validated stochastic models predicting phenotypic variability from molecular noise.

Research Question 3: When is cellular heterogeneity functional versus detrimental, and what evolutionary pressures shape noise management strategies? We hypothesize that noise is functional when it enables bet-hedging in fluctuating environments, facilitates cell fate decisions during development, or generates exploration in cellular state space, but is detrimental for housekeeping functions requiring precision. Specific predictions include: (H3a) genes involved in stress response and developmental decisions exhibit higher noise than housekeeping genes even at matched expression levels; (H3b) noise levels in metabolic enzymes are inversely correlated with pathway flux sensitivity, minimizing fitness costs; (H3c) microbial populations in fluctuating environments maintain higher noise in stress-response genes than populations in stable environments; (H3d) developmental genes show temporally regulated noise, with high variability during fate specification followed by noise reduction during differentiation; and (H3e) disease-associated mutations that alter noise levels show signatures of negative selection, indicating fitness costs. We will test these hypotheses by integrating single-cell data with functional annotations, metabolic models, environmental metadata, developmental time-series, lineage tracing data, and population genetics data. We will perform comparative analysis across species and environments to identify evolutionary patterns. Expected outcomes include classification of genes by noise functionality, identification of evolutionary signatures of noise optimization, and principles linking noise management to cellular fitness.

Cross-cutting validation approaches will ensure robustness of findings. We will use independent datasets for training and validation, perform sensitivity analyses on modeling assumptions, compare findings across organisms (bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells) to identify universal versus system-specific principles, and benchmark predictions against prospective measurements from ongoing studies. Deliverables include quantitative predictive models, statistical frameworks for variance decomposition, curated datasets with standardized noise metrics, and open-source software tools for noise analysis. These outputs will enable the community to apply our frameworks to new systems and questions, extending impact beyond our specific analyses.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types through a multi-phase analytical strategy combining statistical analysis, mechanistic modeling, and comparative genomics. The project is organized into four interconnected work packages executed over three years.

Work Package 1: Data Integration and Cellular Noise Atlas Construction (Months 1-12). We will systematically compile and harmonize publicly available datasets spanning multiple scales of biological organization. Primary data sources include: (1) Single-cell RNA-seq datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus, ArrayExpress, Single Cell Portal, and Human Cell Atlas, focusing on high-quality studies with >1000 cells per condition across bacterial (E. coli, B. subtilis), yeast (S. cerevisiae, S. pombe), and mammalian systems (mouse, human primary cells and cell lines); (2) Single-molecule FISH and live-cell imaging datasets quantifying transcriptional bursting kinetics and mRNA/protein distributions from publications with deposited raw data; (3) Flow cytometry and mass cytometry datasets measuring protein abundance distributions; (4) Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data for translation efficiency and mRNA stability; (5) ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNase-seq for regulatory element annotation; (6) Lineage tracing datasets from LARRY, MEMOIR, and other barcoding studies; (7) Phenotypic profiling data from Cell Painting, morphological analysis, and functional assays. We will develop standardized preprocessing pipelines addressing technical noise, batch effects, and quality control using established tools (Seurat, Scanpy, scVI) with custom extensions for noise quantification. For each gene in each dataset, we will compute noise metrics including coefficient of variation, Fano factor, distance to Poisson, and burst parameters estimated from distribution fitting. These will be integrated into a Cellular Noise Atlas—a queryable database linking genes to noise measurements across conditions, cell types, and organisms, with associated metadata on molecular features and regulatory context. This atlas will serve as the foundational resource for all subsequent analyses.

Work Package 2: Molecular Determinants of Noise (Months 6-18). Using the Noise Atlas, we will perform systematic association analyses to identify molecular features predicting noise levels. We will compile gene-level features including promoter sequences, TATA-box presence, CpG islands, transcription factor binding sites, chromatin states, gene length, exon number, 5' and 3' UTR characteristics, mRNA half-life, translation efficiency, protein half-life, and evolutionary conservation. Statistical analyses will employ multiple linear regression, random forest models, and gradient boosting to predict noise from features, with cross-validation across datasets and organisms. We will use SHAP values to interpret feature importance and identify non-linear interactions. For transcriptional bursting, we will fit stochastic two-state models to mRNA distributions to extract burst frequency and size parameters, then relate these to promoter architecture using mechanistic models. Comparative genomics analyses will assess noise conservation for orthologous genes across species using phylogenetic methods. We will validate predictions by comparing against held-out datasets and published experimental perturbations of noise-determining features. Deliverables include quantitative models predicting noise from sequence and regulatory features, identification of noise-control elements, and principles of noise evolution.

Work Package 3: Noise Propagation Through Regulatory Networks (Months 12-24). We will reconstruct regulatory networks from ChIP-seq data, gene expression correlations, and literature-curated interactions using databases including RegulonDB, YEASTRACT, and ENCODE. For each network motif (feedback loops, feedforward loops, cascades), we will identify instances in our datasets and compare noise in regulated versus unregulated genes. We will implement stochastic simulation algorithms (Gillespie algorithm, tau-leaping, linear noise approximation) to model noise propagation through network motifs, parameterized using measured kinetic rates from literature and inferred from data. For mRNA-protein relationships, we will analyze paired measurement datasets (REAP-seq, CITE-seq, scNMT-seq) to quantify noise transmission coefficients and identify buffering mechanisms. We will develop statistical frameworks to decompose phenotypic variance into contributions from different molecular sources using variance partitioning and structural equation modeling. Time-series datasets will be analyzed using dynamic models to capture temporal noise propagation. We will validate predictions by comparing simulated versus observed noise in downstream components and testing model predictions against perturbation experiments reported in literature. Deliverables include stochastic network models, noise transmission rules for regulatory motifs, and software tools for predicting phenotypic noise from molecular measurements.

Work Package 4: Functional Consequences and Evolutionary Analysis (Months 18-36). We will integrate noise measurements with functional annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, and phenotypic databases to test whether noise levels correlate with gene function. Using metabolic models (genome-scale reconstructions from BiGG), we will compute flux control coefficients and test whether noise is minimized for high-sensitivity enzymes. For developmental systems, we will analyze single-cell trajectories using RNA velocity and pseudotime to quantify noise dynamics during differentiation. Lineage tracing data will be analyzed to relate molecular noise to fate decision probabilities using information theory and decision theory frameworks. Comparative analysis across microbial datasets with environmental metadata will test whether noise levels adapt to environmental variability. Population genetics analysis using gnomAD and other variant databases will identify selection signatures on noise-affecting variants. We will perform enrichment analyses to test whether disease-associated variants disproportionately affect noise levels. Deliverables include functional classification of noise roles, evolutionary principles of noise optimization, and frameworks linking molecular noise to cellular fitness.

Computational Infrastructure and Workflow: All analyses will be conducted using reproducible workflows implemented in Snakemake and Nextflow, with version control through GitHub and containerization using Docker. We will utilize high-performance computing resources for large-scale data processing and simulation. Data will be stored in standardized formats (AnnData, HDF5) with comprehensive metadata following FAIR principles. Statistical analyses will use R and Python with established packages plus custom code. All software will be open-source and documented.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 - Complete data compilation and Noise Atlas v1.0 (Month 12); Year 2 - Complete molecular determinants analysis and network modeling (Month 24); Year 3 - Complete functional/evolutionary analysis and finalize all deliverables (Month 36). Quarterly working group meetings will assess progress and adjust priorities. Annual workshops will engage broader community and provide training.

This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes spanning fundamental biological insights, computational tools, and community resources that advance molecular and cellular biology while training the next generation of data-savvy researchers.

Fundamental Scientific Contributions: Our primary contribution will be comprehensive frameworks connecting molecular stochasticity to cellular phenotypes across biological systems. The Cellular Noise Atlas will represent the first systematic quantification of gene expression variability across organisms, cell types, and conditions, enabling meta-analyses impossible within individual studies. By integrating millions of single-cell profiles with biophysical measurements, we will establish quantitative relationships between molecular features and noise levels, revealing design principles of biological noise management. Our analysis of noise propagation through regulatory networks will provide predictive understanding of how cells filter or amplify stochasticity, resolving long-standing questions about the relationship between molecular and phenotypic variability. The functional and evolutionary analyses will distinguish adaptive heterogeneity from unavoidable molecular imprecision, fundamentally advancing understanding of cellular decision-making, bet-hedging strategies, and developmental processes. These insights will address central questions in systems biology about how robust phenotypes emerge from noisy molecular processes and how evolution shapes noise management strategies. The synthesis will reveal whether universal principles govern cellular individuality or whether noise management is highly context-dependent, with profound implications for understanding biological organization.

Computational Tools and Resources: We will deliver open-source software tools enabling researchers to apply our frameworks to new systems. The Cellular Noise Atlas will be publicly accessible through an interactive web portal allowing queries by gene, cell type, organism, or condition, with visualization tools and downloadable datasets. We will release R and Python packages for noise quantification from single-cell data, implementing standardized metrics and statistical tests. Our stochastic network modeling tools will enable prediction of noise propagation for user-specified regulatory architectures. Variance decomposition frameworks will allow researchers to partition phenotypic variability into molecular sources. All analysis workflows will be documented and containerized for reproducibility. These resources will democratize sophisticated noise analysis, enabling laboratories without specialized expertise to investigate stochasticity in their systems of interest. The tools will be maintained beyond the project period with community input and version control.

Broader Impacts and Applications: Understanding cellular individuality has immediate applications across biotechnology and medicine. In synthetic biology, our predictive models will enable rational design of genetic circuits with specified noise levels, critical for applications requiring controlled heterogeneity such as biosensors and therapeutic cell engineering. In cancer biology, our frameworks will inform understanding of drug resistance arising from non-genetic heterogeneity, potentially identifying strategies to reduce tumor cell variability. In stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, insights into noise during fate decisions will improve directed differentiation protocols. In microbiology and infectious disease, understanding bet-hedging through noise will inform strategies to prevent antibiotic persistence. In immunology, our work will illuminate activation threshold variability affecting immune responses. These applications will be explored through collaborations with applied researchers, with case studies demonstrating practical utility of our frameworks.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary quantitative biology, addressing critical workforce needs. We will recruit trainees from diverse backgrounds including biology, physics, statistics, and computer science, providing cross-training in complementary areas. Trainees will participate in all aspects of the synthesis, gaining expertise in single-cell genomics, biophysical modeling, statistical inference, and collaborative science. We will host annual workshops providing hands-on training in noise analysis methods for 20-30 external participants, with priority for early-career researchers and underrepresented groups. Workshop materials will be publicly available as online tutorials. We will develop educational modules on stochastic gene expression for undergraduate and graduate courses, disseminated through platforms like CourseSource. Trainees will present work at conferences and author publications, developing communication skills and professional networks. This training will prepare the next generation to tackle data-intensive problems in molecular and cellular biology.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: Findings will be disseminated through multiple channels ensuring broad impact. We will publish high-impact papers in journals including Cell, Nature, Science, Cell Systems, and PLOS Computational Biology, with all papers open access. Preprints will be posted immediately upon completion. We will present at major conferences including ASCB, Biophysical Society, ISMB, and systems biology meetings. The Noise Atlas and all tools will be released with accompanying publications in database and software journals. We will engage science communicators to translate findings for broader audiences through press releases and social media. We will establish a project website with regular updates, blog posts explaining key findings, and links to all resources. We will organize symposia at conferences bringing together researchers studying noise across systems.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes foundations for ongoing community efforts in understanding cellular individuality. The Noise Atlas will be designed for continuous expansion as new datasets become available, with mechanisms for community contributions. We will seek sustained funding for atlas maintenance and tool development through database-specific funding mechanisms. The interdisciplinary collaborations established will continue beyond the project period, with participants positioned to lead follow-up studies addressing questions emerging from the synthesis. We envision this work catalyzing a research community focused on quantitative understanding of cellular heterogeneity, with regular meetings and shared resources. The frameworks developed will be applicable to emerging technologies including spatial transcriptomics and multi-omics, ensuring continued relevance. Ultimately, this synthesis will transform cellular individuality from a descriptive phenomenon to a predictive science with quantitative principles and practical applications.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_claude_03,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,claude-sonnet-4-5,Deciphering the Glycan Code: Integrating Glycomics Data to Understand Carbohydrate-Mediated Cellular Communication,"Glycans represent a largely unexplored layer of biological information, mediating cell-cell recognition, immune responses, and pathogen interactions, yet glycomics data remains siloed and underutilized. This synthesis project will integrate glycan structure databases, glycoproteomics datasets, lectin binding profiles, glycosyltransferase expression data, and functional studies of glycan-binding proteins to decode the information content of cellular glycosylation patterns. By assembling glycobiologists, immunologists, structural biologists, and computational scientists, we will analyze glycan diversity across cell types, developmental stages, and disease states to identify functional glycan motifs and their recognition codes. The project will synthesize data from GlyGen, UniCarbKB, GlyTouCan, glycoproteomics repositories, and pathogen-host interaction databases to address: How do glycan patterns encode cellular identity? What rules govern glycan-protein recognition? How do pathogens exploit glycan codes? We will develop machine learning approaches to predict glycan function from structure, map glycosylation changes across differentiation and disease, and identify conserved glycan recognition motifs. This work addresses a fundamental gap in understanding post-translational information encoding that requires integration of structural glycomics, proteomics, immunology, and microbiology data—a scope exceeding individual laboratories. The collaborative framework is essential for standardizing heterogeneous glycomics data formats and integrating them with other omics layers. Deliverables include a comprehensive glycan function atlas, prediction tools for glycan-protein interactions, curated databases of functional glycan epitopes, standardized glycomics analysis workflows, and training programs bridging chemistry and cell biology. This resource will transform understanding of glycan-mediated processes and reveal new therapeutic targets for immune diseases and infections.",,"Background And Significance

Glycosylation is one of the most abundant and structurally diverse post-translational modifications in biology, with over 50% of human proteins estimated to be glycosylated. Unlike the linear information encoding of nucleic acids and proteins, glycans form branched structures with enormous combinatorial complexity, creating a rich information layer that cells use to encode identity, regulate recognition events, and mediate communication. Despite their fundamental importance in cellular processes ranging from development and immunity to cancer and infectious disease, glycans remain the least understood class of biological macromolecules—a knowledge gap often referred to as the 'dark matter' of molecular biology.

Glycans play critical roles in virtually every aspect of cellular communication. Cell surface glycans serve as identity markers that distinguish self from non-self, mediate cell-cell adhesion during development, and regulate immune cell trafficking. Glycan-binding proteins (lectins, antibodies, and microbial adhesins) read these glycan codes to initiate downstream signaling cascades. Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer, with altered glycan patterns promoting metastasis and immune evasion. Pathogens from influenza virus to Plasmodium parasites exploit host glycan codes for cellular entry and immune subversion. Understanding how glycan structures encode biological information and how this information is decoded by glycan-binding proteins represents a fundamental challenge in molecular and cellular biology.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented volumes of glycomics data. Mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics can now profile thousands of glycosylation sites across the proteome. Glycan array technologies enable high-throughput screening of glycan-protein interactions. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals cell-type-specific expression patterns of the hundreds of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases that synthesize and remodel glycans. Structural biology has solved numerous glycan-protein complex structures, revealing atomic-level recognition mechanisms. However, these diverse data types remain largely siloed in specialized repositories with heterogeneous formats and limited interoperability.

Several major databases have emerged to catalog glycomics data. GlyGen integrates glycan and glycoprotein data with protein and gene information. UniCarbKB and GlyTouCan provide comprehensive glycan structure repositories. The Consortium for Functional Glycomics generated extensive glycan array binding data before its conclusion. Glycoproteomics data accumulates in proteomics repositories like PRIDE and MassIVE. Yet these resources remain underutilized because: (1) glycan nomenclature and representation formats vary across databases, hindering integration; (2) glycomics data is rarely linked to functional outcomes or disease phenotypes; (3) computational tools for glycan structure analysis lag far behind those for genomics and proteomics; and (4) the chemical complexity of glycans creates barriers for non-specialists.

Critical gaps exist in our understanding of glycan-mediated communication. We lack systematic knowledge of which glycan structures are present on which proteins in which cell types—a 'glycan atlas' analogous to gene expression atlases. The rules governing glycan-protein recognition remain poorly defined, with most studies focusing on individual interactions rather than systematic patterns. How cells regulate their glycosylation machinery to produce specific glycan codes during differentiation or in response to environmental signals is incompletely understood. The extent to which glycan codes are conserved across species or vary between individuals remains largely unexplored.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, sufficient high-quality glycomics data now exists across multiple modalities to enable meaningful integration and meta-analysis. Second, advances in machine learning provide powerful tools for extracting patterns from complex structural data. Third, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of glycan-mediated pathogen-host interactions, with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein heavily glycosylated and binding host receptors through glycan-mediated mechanisms. Fourth, emerging glycan-targeted therapeutics (glycan-binding antibodies, glycosylation inhibitors, glycan-based vaccines) require better understanding of glycan function. Finally, the glycobiology community has recognized the need for data standardization and integration, creating a receptive environment for synthesis efforts. This project addresses a fundamental gap that cannot be filled by individual laboratories due to the need for diverse expertise spanning chemistry, structural biology, immunology, microbiology, and computational science, along with the technical challenges of integrating heterogeneous data formats and developing specialized analytical tools.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project will address three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes.

Research Question 1: How do glycan patterns encode cellular identity across cell types, developmental stages, and physiological states? We hypothesize that distinct cell types express characteristic 'glycan signatures' that reflect their differentiation state, tissue context, and functional specialization. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Hierarchical clustering of glycoproteomics data will reveal cell-type-specific glycosylation patterns that correlate with lineage relationships; (H1b) Glycan complexity and branching increase with developmental progression and cellular differentiation; (H1c) Specific glycan motifs (e.g., sialyl-Lewis X, high-mannose structures, complex fucosylation patterns) serve as markers for stem cells, immune cell subsets, and differentiated tissues; and (H1d) Disease states (cancer, autoimmunity, metabolic disorders) exhibit reproducible alterations in glycan signatures that distinguish them from healthy tissues. We will test these hypotheses by integrating glycoproteomics datasets from normal and diseased tissues, correlating glycan profiles with single-cell transcriptomics data on glycosyltransferase expression, and mapping glycan structures to cell surface proteins across developmental time series. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive glycan atlas mapping glycan structures to cell types and states, identification of glycan biomarkers for cellular identity, and quantitative models predicting glycan profiles from glycosyltransferase expression patterns.

Research Question 2: What structural and biochemical rules govern glycan-protein recognition, and can we predict binding specificity from glycan and protein structures? We hypothesize that glycan-protein recognition follows predictable rules based on structural complementarity, with specific glycan motifs recognized by defined protein domains through conserved binding mechanisms. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) Glycan-binding proteins cluster into families with shared binding preferences for specific monosaccharide sequences, linkage types, and branching patterns; (H2b) Binding affinity correlates with the number and spatial arrangement of glycan-protein contact points, following quantitative structure-activity relationships; (H2c) Multivalent glycan presentation enhances binding avidity in predictable ways based on glycan spacing and protein oligomerization state; and (H2d) Machine learning models trained on glycan array data and structural complexes can predict binding specificity for uncharacterized glycan-protein pairs with >70% accuracy. We will test these hypotheses by integrating glycan array binding data from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics and published studies, analyzing solved structures of glycan-protein complexes from the Protein Data Bank, and developing computational models that relate glycan structure to binding profiles. Validation will involve comparing predictions against held-out experimental data and testing predictions on recently published datasets not used in model training. Expected deliverables include a curated database of glycan-protein interactions with standardized binding measurements, structural rules for glycan recognition organized by protein family, and machine learning tools for predicting glycan-binding specificity.

Research Question 3: How do pathogens exploit host glycan codes for infection, and what conserved glycan-pathogen interaction motifs exist across microbial species? We hypothesize that successful pathogens have evolved to recognize abundant host glycan structures, with convergent evolution producing similar binding specificities across unrelated pathogen species. Specific predictions include: (H3a) Viral, bacterial, and parasitic adhesins preferentially target glycan structures that are highly expressed on host cell surfaces and conserved across host species; (H3b) Pathogens that infect multiple tissues express adhesins recognizing glycans common to those tissues, while tissue-specific pathogens recognize specialized glycan structures; (H3c) Pathogen glycan mimicry—where microbial surface glycans resemble host structures—correlates with immune evasion and chronic infection; and (H3d) Seasonal influenza evolution involves mutations in hemagglutinin that alter glycan-binding specificity, with predictable patterns based on human population glycan profiles. We will test these hypotheses by integrating pathogen-host interaction databases, glycan array data for microbial adhesins, structural data on pathogen-glycan complexes, and epidemiological data on infection patterns. Analysis will identify conserved glycan motifs targeted across pathogen classes, correlate binding specificity with tissue tropism and host range, and map evolutionary changes in pathogen glycan recognition. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive catalog of pathogen-glycan interactions, identification of glycan structures that could serve as therapeutic decoys or vaccine targets, and predictive models for pathogen binding specificity that could inform pandemic preparedness.

Cross-cutting validation strategies will ensure rigor across all research questions. We will use multiple independent datasets to test each hypothesis, employ cross-validation and held-out test sets for machine learning models, compare findings across species to identify conserved versus lineage-specific patterns, and engage experimental glycobiologists to validate key computational predictions. Success metrics include quantitative improvements in prediction accuracy over existing methods, identification of novel glycan motifs validated by literature or experimental collaborators, and adoption of our tools and databases by the glycobiology community.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse glycomics data types through a systematic workflow combining data harmonization, multi-scale integration, computational analysis, and validation. The project will proceed through four interconnected phases over a three-year timeline.

Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Harmonization, and Integration (Months 1-9). We will systematically compile glycomics data from multiple public repositories. Primary data sources include: (1) GlyGen for integrated glycan and glycoprotein information linked to genes and proteins; (2) UniCarbKB and GlyTouCan for comprehensive glycan structure databases with >100,000 unique structures; (3) GlycoPOST and glycoproteomics datasets in PRIDE/MassIVE repositories, targeting >50 studies covering diverse cell types and disease states; (4) Consortium for Functional Glycomics glycan array data comprising >5,000 binding experiments; (5) Protein Data Bank structures of glycan-protein complexes (>2,000 entries); (6) Gene Expression Omnibus and Single Cell Portal for glycosyltransferase expression data across cell types; (7) IEDB and pathogen-host interaction databases for immune-related glycan recognition; and (8) published literature datasets from systematic reviews of glycan function studies. A critical challenge is heterogeneous data formats. We will develop standardized data schemas based on existing ontologies (GlycoRDF, GlycoCT) and create conversion pipelines to harmonize nomenclature. Each glycan structure will be represented in multiple formats (IUPAC, GlycoCT, WURCS) with cross-references. Quality control will involve automated validation of glycan structures, removal of duplicates, and expert curation of ambiguous entries. We will construct a unified relational database linking glycan structures to proteins, cell types, binding partners, and functional annotations, with all data versioned and provenance-tracked.

Phase 2: Multi-Scale Glycan Analysis and Pattern Discovery (Months 6-18). We will apply complementary analytical approaches to identify patterns across scales. For glycan structure analysis, we will develop graph-based representations treating glycans as molecular graphs, enabling application of graph neural networks and substructure mining algorithms to identify recurring motifs. Dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP) will visualize glycan structure space and identify clusters. For glycoproteomics integration, we will map site-specific glycosylation data to protein structures, identifying glycosylation hotspots and correlating glycan occupancy with protein domains and functions. Integration with transcriptomics will involve correlating glycan profiles with glycosyltransferase expression using canonical correlation analysis and Bayesian network inference to reconstruct glycosylation pathways. For cell-type-specific analysis, we will compile glycan profiles across >100 cell types, applying hierarchical clustering and random forest classification to identify cell-type-specific signatures. Differential glycosylation analysis will compare disease versus healthy states using statistical methods adapted from transcriptomics (DESeq2-like approaches for glycan abundance). For evolutionary analysis, we will compare glycan structures and glycosyltransferase repertoires across species to identify conserved versus lineage-specific features.

Phase 3: Machine Learning for Glycan Function Prediction (Months 12-24). We will develop predictive models using multiple machine learning architectures. For glycan-protein binding prediction, we will train models on glycan array data using: (1) glycan structure features (monosaccharide composition, linkage patterns, branching, terminal motifs); (2) protein sequence and structural features (domain composition, binding site properties); and (3) physicochemical descriptors. We will compare random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning approaches, with rigorous cross-validation and external validation on independent datasets. Graph neural networks will learn directly from glycan graph structures. For glycan function prediction, we will train multi-task models predicting biological roles (immune recognition, cell adhesion, signaling) from structure, using functional annotations from literature and databases as training labels. Transfer learning will leverage models pre-trained on large chemical databases. For disease association prediction, we will develop models identifying glycan alterations associated with specific diseases, integrating glycomics with clinical metadata. All models will include uncertainty quantification and interpretability analysis (SHAP values, attention mechanisms) to identify key structural features driving predictions.

Phase 4: Pathogen-Host Glycan Interaction Analysis (Months 15-30). We will conduct focused analysis of pathogen-glycan recognition by compiling binding data for viral (influenza, coronavirus, norovirus), bacterial (E. coli, Helicobacter, Streptococcus), and parasitic (Plasmodium, Trypanosoma) adhesins. Network analysis will map pathogen-glycan interaction networks, identifying hub glycans targeted by multiple pathogens and specialist glycans with narrow binding profiles. Structural analysis of pathogen adhesin-glycan complexes will identify conserved binding mechanisms and predict binding for uncharacterized adhesins. Evolutionary analysis will track changes in pathogen glycan specificity, particularly for influenza hemagglutinin across strains and years. Integration with epidemiological data will test whether population-level glycan polymorphisms correlate with infection susceptibility.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 - Complete data acquisition and harmonization (M9); Release initial integrated database (M12). Year 2 - Complete multi-scale analysis and pattern discovery (M18); Publish glycan atlas manuscript (M20); Release machine learning prediction tools (M24). Year 3 - Complete pathogen-host analysis (M30); Publish methods and applications manuscripts (M33); Release final curated databases and analysis workflows (M36). Quarterly working group meetings will ensure coordination, with annual workshops for community input and trainee education.

Computational Infrastructure: Analysis will use high-performance computing resources, with code developed in Python (scikit-learn, PyTorch, RDKit for cheminformatics) and R (Bioconductor packages). All workflows will be containerized (Docker) and documented in Jupyter notebooks. Data will be stored in PostgreSQL databases with RESTful APIs for access. Interactive visualization tools will be developed using Plotly and D3.js.

Validation and Quality Control: We will implement multiple validation strategies including cross-validation within datasets, validation across independent datasets, comparison with experimental literature, and engagement with experimental collaborators for prospective validation of key predictions. Regular data quality audits will ensure accuracy and completeness.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative resources, tools, and insights that fundamentally advance glycobiology and molecular/cellular biology more broadly, with impacts spanning basic science, translational research, and workforce development.

The atlas will include >10,000 curated glycan-protein associations, >100 cell-type-specific glycan profiles, and quantitative data on glycan abundance and variability. (2) GlycoPredict—a suite of machine learning tools for predicting glycan-protein interactions, glycan function from structure, and disease-associated glycan alterations. These tools will be accessible through web interfaces and as downloadable software packages, with documented APIs for integration into analysis pipelines. Benchmark testing will demonstrate >70% accuracy for binding prediction and >80% accuracy for cell-type classification from glycan profiles. (3) Pathogen-Glycan Interaction Database—a curated resource cataloging >1,000 pathogen-host glycan interactions with structural, functional, and epidemiological context. This will include predictive models for pathogen binding specificity and identification of conserved glycan epitopes as therapeutic targets. (4) Standardized Glycomics Analysis Workflows—documented, reproducible pipelines for glycan structure analysis, glycoproteomics data processing, and integration with other omics data. These workflows will be published as Jupyter notebooks and Galaxy tools, lowering barriers for non-specialists. (5) Glycan Motif Library—a curated collection of functionally validated glycan epitopes with their recognition partners, biological roles, and disease associations, serving as a reference for interpreting glycomics data.

Broader Scientific Impact: This project addresses fundamental questions about biological information encoding beyond the central dogma. By revealing how glycan structures encode cellular identity and mediate recognition, we will establish glycans as a critical information layer comparable to the genome, transcriptome, and proteome. The project will demonstrate that post-translational modifications carry rich, decodable information—a paradigm shift from viewing them as simple regulatory switches. Our findings will impact multiple fields: (1) Immunology—revealing how glycan codes regulate immune cell trafficking, antigen recognition, and self/non-self discrimination, with implications for autoimmunity, transplantation, and cancer immunotherapy; (2) Developmental Biology—elucidating how glycosylation changes orchestrate cell fate decisions and tissue organization; (3) Cancer Biology—identifying glycan alterations that promote metastasis and immune evasion as therapeutic targets; (4) Infectious Disease—revealing pathogen recognition mechanisms and identifying glycan-based intervention strategies; (5) Structural Biology—providing systematic data on glycan-protein recognition rules to guide structure prediction and design; (6) Systems Biology—demonstrating integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics for holistic understanding of cellular states.

Translational and Clinical Applications: Our resources will accelerate development of glycan-targeted therapeutics and diagnostics. Identified glycan biomarkers could enable early disease detection or patient stratification. Pathogen-glycan interaction data will inform vaccine design (glycan-based immunogens) and antiviral strategies (glycan-binding inhibitors). Understanding glycan codes in cancer will reveal targets for antibody therapies and CAR-T cell engineering. The project will identify glycan structures whose synthesis could be modulated therapeutically, with predictions of phenotypic consequences.

Press releases will highlight key findings for broader audiences.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes infrastructure and community practices for ongoing glycomics data synthesis. We will form a Glycomics Data Integration Consortium to coordinate future efforts, establish data standards, and maintain resources. The tools and workflows developed will be applicable to emerging glycomics technologies, ensuring continued relevance. By demonstrating the power of synthesis research in glycobiology, we will catalyze similar efforts in other underexplored areas of molecular biology, establishing a model for community-scale data integration.

This synthesis project will integrate transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data from senescent cells across tissues, species, and senescence-inducing conditions to identify core versus context-specific senescence programs. By uniting aging researchers, cancer biologists, evolutionary biologists, and systems biologists, we will analyze molecular signatures of senescence to distinguish universal features from tissue- and species-specific adaptations. The project will synthesize data from CellAge, senescence atlases, aging databases, comparative genomics repositories, and cancer datasets to address: What defines the minimal senescence program? How did senescence evolve across species? Why do different tissues exhibit distinct senescence phenotypes? We will apply comparative transcriptomics to identify conserved senescence modules, integrate epigenetic data to understand senescence stability, and use metabolomics to characterize senescence-associated metabolic rewiring. This work addresses fundamental questions about cellular aging mechanisms that require integration of multi-omics data across evolutionary and physiological contexts—capabilities beyond single laboratories. The synthesis demands expertise in aging biology, comparative genomics, and multi-modal data integration. Outputs include a comparative senescence atlas mapping molecular programs across contexts, tools for identifying senescence signatures in diverse datasets, evolutionary analyses of senescence pathway origins, standardized senescence analysis protocols, and interdisciplinary training in aging biology. This resource will clarify senescence biology's role in health and disease while revealing evolutionarily conserved therapeutic targets for age-related pathologies.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular senescence, first described by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961, represents a state of stable cell cycle arrest accompanied by profound phenotypic changes including altered metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and secretion of inflammatory factors collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Over six decades of research have revealed that senescence is not merely a culture artifact but a fundamental biological program with critical roles in embryonic development, wound healing, tumor suppression, and aging. However, the field faces a paradox: senescence can be both beneficial and detrimental depending on context, duration, and tissue environment. This duality has profound implications for understanding age-related diseases and developing therapeutic interventions.

Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have generated unprecedented volumes of molecular data on senescent cells across diverse experimental systems. Studies have characterized senescence induced by replicative exhaustion, oncogene activation, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed heterogeneity within senescent populations, while epigenomic studies have identified senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and DNA methylation changes. Proteomic analyses have catalogued SASP components, and metabolomic profiling has uncovered metabolic reprogramming in senescent cells. Despite this wealth of data, fundamental questions remain unanswered because existing studies are fragmented across laboratories, model systems, and experimental conditions.

Current limitations in senescence research stem from several factors. First, most studies focus on single cell types or tissues, typically human fibroblasts or mouse embryonic fibroblasts, limiting generalizability. Second, different senescence inducers may trigger distinct molecular programs, but systematic comparisons across induction methods are rare. Third, evolutionary perspectives on senescence are underdeveloped; while senescence has been documented in organisms from yeast to humans, comparative analyses identifying conserved versus lineage-specific features are lacking. Fourth, the relationship between acute beneficial senescence (as in wound healing) and chronic detrimental senescence (as in aging tissues) remains poorly understood at the molecular level.

The significance of addressing these gaps cannot be overstated. Cellular senescence accumulates with age in multiple tissues and contributes to age-related pathologies including atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. Senescent cells in the tumor microenvironment can paradoxically promote cancer progression despite senescence's tumor-suppressive role in pre-malignant cells. Senolytic drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells have shown promise in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, yet rational therapeutic design is hampered by incomplete understanding of which senescence features are essential versus dispensable, universal versus context-specific.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the accumulation of publicly available multi-omics datasets has reached a critical mass enabling comprehensive comparative analyses previously impossible. Resources including CellAge database, the Cellular Senescence Gene Database, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and tissue-specific aging atlases contain thousands of relevant datasets. Second, computational tools for integrating heterogeneous data types and performing cross-species comparisons have matured significantly. Third, the aging research community has recognized the need for standardized approaches to identify and characterize senescent cells, as evidenced by recent consensus statements. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted connections between cellular senescence, age-related vulnerability, and inflammatory responses, intensifying interest in senescence biology.

By synthesizing existing data across tissues, species, and senescence triggers, this project will address fundamental questions about the minimal molecular requirements for senescence, the evolutionary origins and conservation of senescence programs, and the mechanistic basis for tissue-specific senescence phenotypes. This synthesis approach is essential because no single laboratory possesses the expertise spanning aging biology, evolutionary genomics, cancer biology, systems biology, and computational biology required to tackle these questions comprehensively. The collaborative, transdisciplinary nature of this project aligns perfectly with the goals of advancing molecular and cellular sciences through data synthesis while training the next generation of researchers in integrative approaches to complex biological problems.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will fundamentally advance understanding of cellular senescence mechanisms.

Research Question 1: What defines the minimal molecular program sufficient for cellular senescence across biological contexts? Despite decades of research, the field lacks consensus on which molecular features are essential versus accessory to senescence. We hypothesize that a core senescence program exists, comprising a minimal set of genes, pathways, and regulatory mechanisms conserved across cell types, tissues, species, and senescence inducers. We predict this core program will include: (1) cell cycle arrest machinery centered on p53/p21 and/or p16/Rb pathways; (2) DNA damage response components; (3) specific chromatin remodeling factors; (4) metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis and altered NAD+ metabolism; and (5) a subset of SASP factors involved in autocrine senescence reinforcement. Conversely, we hypothesize that many reported senescence markers represent context-specific adaptations rather than universal requirements. We predict that tissue-specific transcription factors, particular SASP cytokines, and certain metabolic features will vary systematically with cell type and senescence trigger. To test these hypotheses, we will perform meta-analyses of transcriptomic data from senescent versus non-senescent cells across >500 datasets, identifying genes consistently upregulated or downregulated regardless of context. We will apply network analysis to identify core regulatory modules and use machine learning to develop minimal gene signatures that distinguish senescent from non-senescent cells with high accuracy across diverse datasets. Validation will involve testing whether these minimal signatures successfully identify senescent cells in independent datasets not used for signature development, including single-cell RNA-seq data where senescence status can be inferred from other markers.

Research Question 2: How did cellular senescence evolve, and what evolutionary pressures shaped senescence programs across species? Senescence-like phenomena have been reported in organisms spanning evolutionary distances from unicellular yeasts to long-lived mammals, yet the evolutionary trajectory of senescence mechanisms remains unclear. We hypothesize that senescence evolved from ancient stress response and cell cycle control mechanisms, with elaboration of SASP and chromatin remodeling features in multicellular organisms where senescent cells can influence neighboring cells and tissue environments. We predict that: (1) core cell cycle arrest machinery will show deep evolutionary conservation, traceable to unicellular ancestors; (2) SASP components will show lineage-specific expansion, particularly in vertebrates with complex immune systems; (3) species with longer lifespans will exhibit more robust senescence programs with enhanced tumor suppression features; and (4) organisms with high regenerative capacity may have evolved mechanisms to efficiently clear senescent cells. To test these hypotheses, we will perform comparative genomic analyses of senescence-associated genes across species representing major evolutionary transitions: yeast, C. elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice, naked mole rats, and humans. We will use phylogenetic methods to reconstruct ancestral states of senescence pathways and identify gene family expansions/contractions associated with senescence evolution. We will correlate senescence program features with species-specific traits including maximum lifespan, body size, cancer resistance, and regenerative capacity using phylogenetically-informed comparative methods. Expected outcomes include an evolutionary timeline of senescence feature acquisition and identification of lineage-specific adaptations that may explain species differences in aging and cancer susceptibility.

Research Question 3: Why do different tissues exhibit distinct senescence phenotypes, and how do tissue microenvironments shape senescence programs? Senescent cells in liver, brain, adipose tissue, and vasculature display markedly different phenotypes, yet the molecular basis for tissue-specific senescence remains poorly characterized. We hypothesize that tissue-specific transcription factors, signaling environments, and metabolic constraints shape senescence programs by modulating expression of the core senescence machinery and determining which context-specific features are activated. We predict that: (1) tissue-specific master regulators will control distinct SASP profiles adapted to each tissue's physiological functions; (2) metabolic features of senescence will vary with tissue-specific bioenergetic demands; (3) epigenetic landscapes will constrain which senescence programs can be activated in different cell types; and (4) cell-cell interactions within tissue microenvironments will influence senescence phenotypes through paracrine signaling. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic data from senescent cells across at least 15 tissue types. We will use regulatory network analysis to identify tissue-specific transcription factors controlling senescence gene expression and perform pathway enrichment analyses to characterize tissue-specific functional adaptations. We will apply deconvolution methods to bulk tissue data from aged organisms to infer how senescent cell accumulation patterns differ across tissues. Expected outcomes include a tissue-resolved senescence atlas, mechanistic insights into why certain tissues accumulate more senescent cells with aging, and identification of tissue-specific vulnerabilities for therapeutic targeting. Collectively, addressing these three research questions will provide unprecedented comprehensive understanding of senescence biology, with clear predictions that can be validated through computational analyses of existing data and will generate hypotheses for future experimental studies.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse publicly available datasets through a systematic, phased approach combining bioinformatics, comparative genomics, network analysis, and machine learning methods. The project timeline spans 36 months with clearly defined milestones.

Data Sources and Acquisition (Months 1-6): We will systematically identify and curate datasets from multiple public repositories. Primary sources include: (1) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress for transcriptomic data from senescence experiments across species and tissues; (2) CellAge database containing senescence-associated genes; (3) Cellular Senescence Gene Database; (4) Single Cell Portal and Single Cell Expression Atlas for single-cell RNA-seq data; (5) ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics for epigenetic data; (6) PRIDE and ProteomeXchange for proteomic data; (7) MetaboLights and Metabolomics Workbench for metabolomics data; (8) GenAge and AnAge databases for aging-related information; (9) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for senescence in cancer contexts; (10) Comparative genomics databases including Ensembl, NCBI, and orthology databases. We will establish inclusion criteria: datasets must include senescent and control samples with clear experimental descriptions, quality metrics, and sufficient sample sizes (minimum n=3 per condition). We anticipate curating 500-800 transcriptomic datasets, 100-150 epigenomic datasets, 50-80 proteomic datasets, and 30-50 metabolomic datasets. A comprehensive metadata schema will capture experimental variables including species, tissue/cell type, senescence inducer, timepoint, and technical parameters. All data will be processed through standardized pipelines to ensure comparability.

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis (Months 4-15): For each dataset, we will perform differential expression analysis comparing senescent versus control samples using appropriate methods (DESeq2 for RNA-seq, limma for microarrays). We will then conduct meta-analyses across datasets using random-effects models to identify consistently differentially expressed genes while accounting for study heterogeneity. To identify the core senescence program, we will apply multiple complementary approaches: (1) rank-based meta-analysis identifying genes consistently ranked highly across studies; (2) machine learning classification (random forests, support vector machines) to identify minimal gene sets distinguishing senescent from non-senescent cells; (3) weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify conserved senescence modules; (4) consensus clustering to group datasets by senescence signatures and identify context-specific patterns. We will stratify analyses by species, tissue type, and senescence inducer to distinguish universal from context-specific features. Single-cell RNA-seq data will be analyzed using Seurat and Scanpy pipelines to characterize senescence heterogeneity and identify senescence trajectories. Trajectory inference methods will map transitions into senescence states.

Evolutionary and Comparative Genomics Analysis (Months 10-24): We will identify orthologs of senescence-associated genes across species using reciprocal best-hit approaches and orthology databases. Phylogenetic analyses will reconstruct evolutionary histories of senescence pathways using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. We will perform gene family expansion/contraction analyses using CAFE and identify positive selection signatures using PAML. Synteny analysis will assess conservation of genomic organization around senescence genes. We will correlate senescence program features with species traits (lifespan, body mass, cancer resistance) using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) to account for evolutionary relationships. Ancestral state reconstruction will infer senescence pathway features in common ancestors at key evolutionary nodes. This analysis will produce an evolutionary timeline of senescence feature acquisition and identify lineage-specific innovations.

Epigenomic Integration (Months 12-24): We will integrate DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin accessibility data with transcriptomic data to understand epigenetic regulation of senescence. Differential methylation analysis will identify senescence-associated CpG sites and regions. We will map histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) at senescence genes to characterize chromatin states. Integration with transcription factor binding data will identify regulatory networks controlling senescence entry and maintenance. We will assess chromatin accessibility changes using ATAC-seq data to identify regulatory elements activated or repressed during senescence. Epigenetic clock analyses will examine relationships between senescence and epigenetic aging signatures.

Metabolomic and Proteomic Analysis (Months 15-27): We will perform meta-analyses of metabolomic data to identify consistent metabolic changes in senescence, including alterations in glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Pathway enrichment analysis will identify metabolic pathways systematically altered across contexts. Proteomic data will be analyzed to characterize SASP composition across tissues and species, identifying core versus variable SASP components. We will integrate proteomic and transcriptomic data to assess correspondence between mRNA and protein levels for senescence markers. Multi-omics integration will use tools like MOFA+ and mixOmics to identify coordinated changes across molecular layers.

Network Analysis and Systems Biology (Months 18-30): We will construct gene regulatory networks controlling senescence using transcription factor binding data, expression correlations, and regulatory databases. Network analysis will identify master regulators, hub genes, and network modules specific to senescence. We will build tissue-specific networks to understand how tissue context shapes senescence programs. Metabolic network modeling will characterize metabolic flux changes in senescence. Integration of protein-protein interaction networks will identify signaling pathways driving senescence phenotypes.

Validation and Tool Development (Months 24-36): We will validate identified senescence signatures on independent datasets not used in discovery analyses, assessing sensitivity, specificity, and generalizability. We will develop computational tools including: (1) a senescence signature scoring algorithm applicable to diverse datasets; (2) a web-accessible comparative senescence atlas with interactive visualization; (3) standardized analysis pipelines for senescence data; (4) machine learning models for predicting senescence from molecular profiles. All tools will be documented, benchmarked, and made publicly available through GitHub and user-friendly web interfaces.

Project Management and Collaboration: The team will meet bi-weekly via videoconference with quarterly in-person meetings. We will use collaborative platforms (Slack, GitHub, shared computational resources) for coordination. Trainees will rotate between labs to gain diverse expertise. Annual workshops will engage the broader community and disseminate interim findings.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes advancing cellular senescence research and broader fields of aging biology, cancer biology, and evolutionary biology, while establishing new paradigms for collaborative data synthesis in molecular and cellular sciences.

Primary Scientific Outcomes: The project will produce a comprehensive Comparative Senescence Atlas, an interactive, publicly accessible resource mapping molecular programs of senescence across tissues, species, and contexts. This atlas will include: (1) curated metadata for 500+ senescence datasets; (2) standardized processed data enabling cross-study comparisons; (3) interactive visualizations of senescence signatures across biological contexts; (4) downloadable gene lists, network models, and analysis results; (5) evolutionary annotations showing conservation patterns. This resource will serve as the definitive reference for senescence biology, analogous to how the Human Cell Atlas serves single-cell biology. We will define the minimal senescence program through rigorous meta-analysis, providing the field with consensus molecular criteria for identifying senescent cells. This addresses a critical need, as current senescence markers are inconsistently applied across studies. Our minimal signature will enable more accurate senescence detection in complex tissues and disease contexts. The evolutionary analysis will reveal how senescence mechanisms evolved and diversified, providing insights into why different organisms age differently and exhibit varying cancer susceptibilities. This evolutionary perspective will identify deeply conserved features representing the most fundamental aspects of senescence, likely the best therapeutic targets due to their essential nature. Our tissue-specific senescence characterization will explain why certain tissues accumulate senescent cells preferentially during aging and why senescence phenotypes vary across anatomical locations. This understanding is crucial for developing tissue-targeted senolytic therapies and predicting which tissues will benefit most from senescence-modulating interventions.

Methodological and Computational Contributions: We will develop and validate computational tools that will become community standards for senescence research. The senescence signature scoring algorithm will enable researchers to quantify senescence in their own datasets, facilitating comparisons across studies. The standardized analysis pipelines will reduce technical variability and improve reproducibility in senescence research. Machine learning models for senescence prediction will enable identification of senescent cells in datasets lacking traditional markers, expanding the scope of senescence research. All computational tools will be open-source, well-documented, and accompanied by tutorials, ensuring broad accessibility. We will publish detailed protocols for multi-omics data integration in senescence research, providing templates for similar synthesis efforts in other biological domains.

Broader Scientific Impact: This project will impact multiple research communities beyond senescence specialists. Aging researchers will gain molecular insights into how cellular senescence contributes to organismal aging and age-related diseases. Cancer biologists will better understand senescence's dual roles in tumor suppression and tumor promotion, informing therapeutic strategies that manipulate senescence in cancer contexts. Evolutionary biologists will gain insights into how aging-related mechanisms evolve and how life history traits shape cellular programs. Systems biologists will benefit from our multi-omics integration approaches applicable to other complex biological phenomena. The project will reveal evolutionarily conserved therapeutic targets for age-related diseases. By identifying senescence features conserved from model organisms to humans, we will highlight pathways amenable to study in tractable experimental systems and likely to translate to human therapies. Conversely, identifying human-specific senescence features will explain why some interventions effective in mice fail in human trials.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train 6-8 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in cutting-edge data science approaches, comparative biology, and collaborative research. Trainees will gain expertise spanning multiple disciplines, preparing them for careers in academic research, biotechnology, or data science. We will develop and disseminate educational materials including online tutorials, workshop curricula, and case studies demonstrating synthesis research approaches. Annual workshops will train 30-40 external researchers in senescence data analysis, multiplying the project's impact. We will prioritize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research infrastructure, promoting diversity in the scientific workforce.

Dissemination and Open Science: All findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals, with preprints posted immediately upon completion. We will publish at least 8-10 peer-reviewed articles covering: (1) the core senescence program; (2) evolutionary analysis of senescence; (3) tissue-specific senescence mechanisms; (4) multi-omics integration methods; (5) the Comparative Senescence Atlas; (6) computational tools and pipelines; (7) metabolic reprogramming in senescence; (8) SASP diversity and regulation. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be deposited in appropriate repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, Dryad) with clear documentation. The Comparative Senescence Atlas will be maintained as a living resource, updated as new data become available. We will present findings at major conferences (American Aging Association, Keystone Symposia, EMBO meetings) and organize symposia bringing together diverse researchers. We will engage with pharmaceutical companies developing senolytic therapies, facilitating translation of basic insights to clinical applications.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes a framework for ongoing synthesis research in senescence biology. The collaborative network will persist beyond the funding period, continuing to integrate new data and refine understanding. The Comparative Senescence Atlas will be hosted on stable infrastructure with plans for long-term maintenance. We will seek additional funding to expand the atlas to include spatial transcriptomics, single-cell multi-omics, and functional genomics data as these technologies mature. The project will catalyze follow-up research including experimental validation of predictions, development of improved senescence models, and clinical trials of senescence-targeted therapies informed by our findings. Ultimately, this synthesis will accelerate progress toward interventions that modulate senescence to promote healthy aging and treat age-related diseases.

This synthesis project will integrate ionomics data, ion channel expression profiles, electrophysiology datasets, metabolomics, and signaling pathway databases to map the cellular ion regulatory landscape. By bringing together ion channel biologists, metabolic biochemists, systems biologists, and biophysicists, we will analyze how cells maintain ion homeostasis while using ionic fluctuations for signaling across diverse conditions and cell types. The project will synthesize data from IonChannelDB, electrophysiology repositories, ionomics studies, metabolic databases, and calcium/pH imaging datasets to address: How do cells multiplex ionic signals? What determines ion-specific versus cross-talk effects? How do ionic and metabolic networks interact? We will develop computational models of ion flux networks, apply dynamical systems analysis to understand ionic oscillations and waves, and integrate ionomics with metabolomics to identify ion-dependent metabolic switches. This addresses fundamental questions about cellular electrochemical regulation that require integration of biophysical measurements, omics data, and network modeling—expertise rarely combined in single laboratories. The synthesis demands infrastructure for integrating heterogeneous data types including electrophysiology, imaging, and biochemical measurements. Deliverables include a cellular ionome atlas mapping ion distributions and dynamics, predictive models of ion-dependent signaling, tools for integrating ionomics with other omics layers, standardized analysis workflows, and training programs in quantitative ion biology. This work will reveal design principles of cellular electrochemical regulation and identify new therapeutic strategies for channelopathies and metabolic diseases.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular function depends fundamentally on the precise regulation of ionic composition and dynamics. Ions including calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, zinc, and iron serve dual roles as both structural cofactors for enzymes and dynamic signaling molecules that orchestrate cellular responses. Despite decades of research on individual ions and channels, we lack a comprehensive framework for understanding how cells coordinate the complex interplay between ionic homeostasis, signaling, and metabolism. This knowledge gap represents a critical barrier to understanding fundamental cellular physiology and developing therapeutic interventions for diseases ranging from cardiac arrhythmias to neurodegeneration and cancer.

The field of ion biology has historically been fragmented into specialized subdisciplines. Ion channel biophysicists have characterized the molecular mechanisms of ion transport with exquisite detail, identifying over 400 ion channel genes in the human genome and elucidating their gating mechanisms through electrophysiology and structural biology. Simultaneously, calcium signaling researchers have revealed the sophisticated temporal and spatial encoding of calcium signals, demonstrating how frequency, amplitude, and subcellular localization of calcium transients encode distinct cellular outcomes. Meanwhile, the emerging field of ionomics has begun cataloging cellular ion concentrations across conditions, and metabolic biochemists have identified numerous ion-dependent enzymatic reactions. However, these research streams have remained largely parallel, with limited integration across scales and modalities.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented quantities of relevant data. High-throughput electrophysiology platforms have characterized thousands of ion channel variants and their responses to diverse conditions. Advances in mass spectrometry-based ionomics enable quantification of 20+ elements simultaneously across cell types and states. Time-lapse imaging with genetically encoded sensors now captures subcellular ion dynamics in living cells. RNA-sequencing databases catalog ion channel expression across tissues, developmental stages, and disease states. Metabolomics platforms profile thousands of metabolites, many of which are ion-dependent. Critically, these datasets exist in public repositories but have never been systematically integrated to address fundamental questions about cellular electrochemical regulation.

Several key observations motivate this synthesis effort. First, cells must simultaneously maintain ion homeostasis while using ionic fluctuations for signaling—a paradox that remains poorly understood. Second, different ions exhibit both specific effects and extensive cross-talk, yet the principles governing specificity versus pleiotropy remain unclear. Third, metabolism and ionic regulation are intimately linked through ion-dependent enzymes, ion-coupled transporters, and the energetic costs of maintaining ion gradients, but these connections have not been systematically mapped. Fourth, ionic dysregulation underlies numerous diseases including channelopathies, cardiac arrhythmias, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, and metabolic disorders, yet we lack predictive frameworks for understanding how ionic perturbations propagate through cellular networks.

Current limitations stem from both conceptual and practical barriers. Conceptually, the field lacks unifying frameworks that bridge biophysical, biochemical, and systems-level perspectives on ion regulation. Practically, integrating heterogeneous data types—electrophysiology traces, imaging time series, omics measurements, and structural data—requires specialized computational infrastructure and expertise rarely found in individual laboratories. Moreover, the dynamic nature of ionic signals, spanning milliseconds to hours and nanometers to whole-cell scales, demands analytical approaches that can handle multi-scale temporal and spatial data.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the maturation of public data repositories now provides sufficient high-quality data for meaningful integration. Second, advances in machine learning and dynamical systems modeling offer powerful tools for extracting principles from complex, multi-modal datasets. Third, growing recognition of the importance of ion dysregulation in disease creates urgent need for predictive frameworks. Finally, the field is poised for a conceptual leap from studying individual ions and channels to understanding the cellular ionome as an integrated regulatory system. By synthesizing existing data through transdisciplinary collaboration, we can address fundamental questions about cellular electrochemical regulation that have remained intractable to traditional single-lab approaches, ultimately revealing design principles that govern how cells encode information and regulate metabolism through ionic dynamics.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our understanding of cellular ion regulation.

Research Question 1: How do cells multiplex ionic signals to encode distinct information while maintaining homeostasis? Cells use multiple ions (Ca2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, Mg2+, Zn2+, H+) as signaling molecules, yet must maintain each within narrow homeostatic ranges. We hypothesize that cells achieve signal multiplexing through three mechanisms: (H1a) temporal encoding, where different ions exhibit characteristic oscillation frequencies and kinetics; (H1b) spatial compartmentalization, where subcellular localization of ion channels and buffers creates distinct microdomains; and (H1c) combinatorial coding, where specific combinations of ionic changes encode unique cellular outcomes. To test H1a, we will analyze calcium imaging datasets, pH-sensitive fluorescence data, and electrophysiology recordings to extract temporal features (frequency, amplitude, duration, inter-spike intervals) and correlate these with cellular outcomes from transcriptomics and phenotypic datasets. We predict that different stimuli will produce distinct temporal signatures in ionic dynamics, and that machine learning classifiers trained on these signatures will accurately predict cellular responses. For H1b, we will integrate subcellular imaging data with ion channel localization data from protein atlas databases and structural information about organellar ion transporters. We predict that ion channels, buffers, and sensors will show non-random spatial organization that creates functionally distinct ionic microdomains. For H1c, we will apply dimensionality reduction and clustering to multi-ion imaging datasets to identify recurring patterns of multi-ion dynamics, predicting that specific ion combinations correlate with distinct transcriptional or metabolic states.

Research Question 2: What molecular and network properties determine ion-specific versus cross-talk effects? While some cellular responses are ion-specific (e.g., calcium-dependent exocytosis), others show promiscuity across ions. We hypothesize that specificity versus cross-talk is determined by: (H2a) the biophysical properties of ion-binding sites in effector proteins, where high-affinity, geometrically constrained sites confer specificity while low-affinity sites permit cross-talk; (H2b) the kinetics of ion dynamics relative to effector response times, where fast ion transients activate only proximal, rapidly-responding effectors; and (H2c) network topology, where ions with many direct targets show more cross-talk while those with few, specific targets show specificity. To test H2a, we will integrate structural databases of ion-binding proteins with biochemical measurements of ion-binding affinities and selectivities, using molecular dynamics simulations on existing structures to predict binding specificities. We will correlate predicted specificities with observed functional outcomes from perturbation studies in the literature. For H2b, we will extract kinetic parameters from electrophysiology and imaging datasets and compare these to known response times of downstream effectors from signaling databases. We predict that effector activation will correlate with temporal overlap between ion dynamics and effector response windows. For H2c, we will construct ion-effector networks from literature mining and pathway databases, applying network analysis to identify topological features (degree, betweenness, clustering) that distinguish specific versus promiscuous ions. We predict that hub ions with high degree will show more cross-talk while peripheral ions will show specificity.

Research Question 3: How do ionic and metabolic networks interact to coordinate cellular energetics and biosynthesis? Ion regulation consumes substantial ATP (20-40% of cellular energy), while many metabolic enzymes require ion cofactors and metabolic state influences ion channel activity. We hypothesize that: (H3a) ion-metabolite interactions create feedback loops that couple energetic state to ion homeostasis; (H3b) specific ions act as metabolic switches, with threshold concentrations triggering metabolic transitions; and (H3c) cells optimize the trade-off between signaling flexibility and energetic cost through coordinated regulation of ion channels and metabolic pathways. To test H3a, we will integrate ionomics data with metabolomics datasets across diverse conditions, applying causal inference methods to identify ion-metabolite relationships and constructing dynamic models of ion-metabolite feedback loops. We predict bidirectional causality between specific ion-metabolite pairs. For H3b, we will identify metabolic enzymes with known ion dependencies from databases, then analyze metabolomics data for threshold-like transitions correlating with ion concentrations from matched ionomics studies. We predict that key metabolic branch points will show switch-like responses to specific ions. For H3c, we will develop constraint-based models incorporating both metabolic flux and ion flux, using multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal solutions balancing signaling capacity against energetic cost. We predict that observed ion channel expression patterns will approximate Pareto-optimal solutions.

Expected outcomes include: (1) quantitative maps of temporal and spatial features distinguishing different ionic signals; (2) predictive rules for ion specificity based on biophysical and network properties; (3) identification of ion-dependent metabolic switches and feedback loops; (4) computational models predicting cellular responses to ionic perturbations; and (5) a comprehensive cellular ionome atlas integrating ion distributions, dynamics, and functional consequences across cell types and conditions. These hypotheses will be validated through comparison with held-out datasets, cross-validation across independent studies, and consistency with known biological mechanisms.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types through a phased workflow combining data aggregation, harmonization, analysis, modeling, and validation. The project will span 36 months with specific milestones and deliverables.

Data Sources and Acquisition (Months 1-6): We will systematically identify and acquire data from multiple public repositories. For ion channel information, we will use IonChannelDB, Channelpedia, and the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology, extracting data on channel properties, tissue expression, and pharmacology. Electrophysiology data will be obtained from the Electrophysiology Data Repository (CRCNS.org), the Allen Brain Atlas electrophysiology datasets, and published patch-clamp studies with deposited data. For ionomics, we will compile data from ICP-MS studies in publications, the Ionomics Hub, and element profiling studies across cell types. Calcium and pH imaging data will be sourced from the Cell Image Library, published datasets with time-series imaging, and biosensor studies using GCaMP, Pericam, and pHluorin reporters. Metabolomics data will come from MetaboLights, Metabolomics Workbench, and HMDB, focusing on studies that include ion measurements or ion perturbations. Gene expression data will be obtained from GEO, ArrayExpress, and the Human Protein Atlas for ion channel and transporter expression across tissues and conditions. Signaling pathway information will be extracted from KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways, and STRING for protein-protein interactions. We will establish data use agreements where required and document data provenance meticulously. Our team will develop a centralized data management system with standardized metadata schemas to ensure FAIR principles.

Data Harmonization and Integration (Months 4-12): Heterogeneous data types require careful harmonization. For electrophysiology data, we will extract standardized features including resting potential, input resistance, capacitance, action potential properties, and current-voltage relationships using custom Python scripts built on Neo and Elephant libraries. Imaging time-series will be processed to extract temporal features (baseline, peak amplitude, rise time, decay time, oscillation frequency, duty cycle) using automated pipelines in Python and MATLAB. Ionomics data will be normalized to cell volume or protein content and converted to molar concentrations. Metabolomics data will be mapped to standardized identifiers (HMDB, ChEBI, KEGG) and normalized using established protocols. Gene expression data will be processed through standard pipelines (DESeq2, limma) and normalized across platforms. All data will be mapped to common ontologies (Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) to enable cross-dataset integration. We will develop a graph database (Neo4j) to represent relationships between ions, channels, transporters, buffers, sensors, metabolites, and cellular phenotypes, enabling complex queries across data types.

Analytical Methods (Months 6-24): For Research Question 1, we will apply time-series analysis methods including Fourier transforms, wavelet analysis, and dynamic time warping to identify temporal signatures in ionic dynamics. Spatial analysis will use point pattern analysis and co-localization metrics on subcellular imaging data. Machine learning approaches (random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) will classify cellular outcomes based on ionic features. For Research Question 2, we will use structural bioinformatics to analyze ion-binding sites, calculating binding pocket volumes, electrostatic potentials, and coordination geometries. Network analysis will apply graph theory metrics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, community detection) to ion-effector networks. We will use partial correlation and Granger causality to infer directional relationships between ions and effectors. For Research Question 3, we will apply correlation network analysis to ion-metabolite datasets, using methods like WGCNA and sparse inverse covariance estimation. Causal inference will employ instrumental variable approaches and convergent cross-mapping. We will identify threshold behaviors using changepoint detection algorithms and dose-response modeling.

Computational Modeling (Months 12-30): We will develop multi-scale computational models of ion regulation. At the molecular scale, we will construct kinetic models of ion channels and transporters using Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, parameterized from electrophysiology data. At the cellular scale, we will build ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of ion flux networks, incorporating channels, transporters, buffers, and spatial compartments. These models will be implemented in COPASI and Python using SciPy. For oscillatory dynamics, we will apply bifurcation analysis and phase plane analysis to identify mechanisms underlying ionic oscillations. We will develop constraint-based models integrating metabolic flux balance analysis with ion flux constraints, implementing these in COBRApy. Agent-based models will simulate spatial aspects of ion signaling in complex cellular geometries. All models will be parameterized from synthesized data and validated against independent datasets. Sensitivity analysis will identify key parameters, and parameter estimation will use Bayesian inference methods (MCMC, nested sampling) to quantify uncertainty.

Validation and Refinement (Months 18-36): Model predictions will be validated through multiple approaches: comparison with held-out datasets not used in model training, cross-validation across independent studies, consistency with known mechanisms from literature, and prediction of outcomes from perturbation experiments reported in the literature. We will quantify prediction accuracy using appropriate metrics (RMSE, correlation coefficients, classification accuracy). Discrepancies will guide model refinement and identify knowledge gaps.

Timeline and Milestones: Months 1-6: Data acquisition and team assembly; Deliverable: Comprehensive data inventory and database infrastructure. Months 6-12: Data harmonization and initial integration; Deliverable: Integrated database with standardized formats. Months 12-18: Analytical methods development and application to RQ1; Deliverable: Temporal and spatial maps of ionic signals. Months 18-24: Analysis of RQ2 and network construction; Deliverable: Ion-effector networks and specificity rules. Months 24-30: Analysis of RQ3 and model development; Deliverable: Ion-metabolite interaction maps and computational models. Months 30-36: Model validation, tool development, and dissemination; Deliverable: Validated models, software tools, publications, and training materials.

Open Science Practices: All code will be version-controlled on GitHub with open-source licenses. Data will be deposited in appropriate repositories (Zenodo, Dryad). Analysis workflows will be documented as Jupyter notebooks and containerized using Docker for reproducibility. We will publish preprints and engage the community through workshops and webinars.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes advancing molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for integrative ion biology research.

Scientific Contributions: The primary deliverable is a comprehensive Cellular Ionome Atlas, an open-access resource mapping ion distributions, dynamics, and functional consequences across cell types, subcellular compartments, and physiological conditions. This atlas will include quantitative data on baseline ion concentrations, dynamic ranges, temporal features of ion signals, spatial organization, and correlations with cellular phenotypes. It will serve as a reference resource for the research community, analogous to how the Human Protein Atlas has transformed protein biology. Second, we will deliver validated computational models predicting cellular responses to ionic perturbations. These models will enable in silico hypothesis testing, reducing the need for costly experiments and accelerating discovery. The models will be implemented as user-friendly software tools with graphical interfaces, allowing researchers without computational expertise to explore ionic regulation. Third, we will establish quantitative principles governing ion signal multiplexing, specificity, and cross-talk. These principles will provide a conceptual framework for understanding how cells encode information through ionic dynamics, addressing fundamental questions that have puzzled the field for decades. Fourth, we will map ion-metabolite interaction networks, revealing how ionic and metabolic regulation are coordinated. This will identify ion-dependent metabolic switches and feedback loops, providing new insights into cellular energetics and biosynthesis.

Methodological Innovations: We will develop novel analytical tools for integrating heterogeneous data types spanning electrophysiology, imaging, and omics measurements. These tools will include standardized pipelines for extracting features from time-series data, methods for mapping data to common ontologies, and algorithms for multi-modal data integration. We will create open-source software packages implementing these methods, documented with tutorials and example datasets. The graph database infrastructure we develop will provide a template for other synthesis efforts requiring integration of diverse biological data types. Our approaches to validating computational models against synthesized data will establish best practices for synthesis research in molecular and cellular biology.

Broader Impacts: Understanding ionic regulation has profound implications for human health. Channelopathies affect millions worldwide, causing cardiac arrhythmias, epilepsy, migraine, cystic fibrosis, and numerous other conditions. Our predictive models will enable identification of therapeutic targets and support drug development by predicting off-target effects of ion channel modulators. The ion-metabolite interaction maps will reveal new connections between ionic dysregulation and metabolic diseases including diabetes and cancer. Beyond human health, principles of ionic regulation are conserved across biology, with applications to plant biology (nutrient uptake, stress responses), microbiology (biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance), and synthetic biology (engineering cellular sensors and actuators). The project will train a new generation of data-savvy researchers through hands-on involvement of graduate students and postdocs in synthesis research. We will develop training modules on quantitative ion biology, data integration, and computational modeling, disseminated through workshops at major conferences and online platforms. These training activities will help build the workforce needed for data-intensive biology.

Dissemination Strategy: We will publish findings in high-impact journals spanning molecular biology (Cell, Nature Cell Biology), biophysics (eLife, Biophysical Journal), and computational biology (PLOS Computational Biology, Nature Methods). We will target at least 8-10 publications over the project period, including both research articles and resource papers describing the Ionome Atlas and software tools. All publications will be open access. We will present findings at major conferences including the Biophysical Society Annual Meeting, American Society for Cell Biology, and EMBO meetings. We will organize symposia bringing together ion biologists, metabolic biochemists, and systems biologists to foster community engagement. The Cellular Ionome Atlas will be hosted on a dedicated website with interactive visualization tools, allowing researchers to explore data, download datasets, and run models. We will establish a user forum for community feedback and contributions. Software tools will be deposited in established repositories (GitHub, BioConductor, PyPI) with comprehensive documentation. We will create video tutorials demonstrating tool usage and analysis workflows.

Follow-up Research: This synthesis project will catalyze numerous follow-up studies. The atlas will reveal unexpected patterns requiring experimental validation, generating hypotheses for traditional laboratory research. The computational models will make predictions testable through targeted experiments. The ion-metabolite interaction maps will identify novel regulatory mechanisms warranting detailed mechanistic investigation. We anticipate that this synthesis will spawn new collaborations between team members and with the broader community, establishing a sustained network for ion biology research. The infrastructure and methods we develop will be applicable to other synthesis efforts, potentially extending to other regulatory systems (lipids, reactive oxygen species, pH) or to comparative analyses across species.

Long-term Vision: We envision this project as the foundation for a new field of systems ion biology, where ionic regulation is understood as an integrated system rather than isolated channels and signals. The principles and tools we develop will enable predictive understanding of cellular electrochemical regulation, transforming ion biology from a descriptive to a predictive science. This will accelerate therapeutic development for channelopathies and metabolic diseases while revealing fundamental design principles of cellular regulation. The collaborative network established through this project will continue beyond the funding period, sustained by shared resources, ongoing data generation by the community, and the scientific momentum generated by our findings.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_claude_06,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,claude-sonnet-4-5,Molecular Determinants of Subcellular Organelle Identity and Crosstalk: A Pan-Organelle Synthesis,"Cells contain diverse membrane-bound organelles that maintain distinct identities while engaging in extensive crosstalk, yet the molecular rules governing organelle specification and communication remain incompletely understood. This synthesis project will integrate organellar proteomics, lipidomics, contact site imaging data, trafficking pathway databases, and organelle morphology datasets to decode the molecular signatures that define organelle identity and mediate inter-organellar communication. By assembling cell biologists, lipid biochemists, membrane trafficking experts, and computational biologists, we will analyze organellar molecular compositions across cell types and conditions to identify identity-determining features and contact site molecular machinery. The project will synthesize data from organelle-specific proteomics studies, lipidomics databases, EM tomography repositories, and trafficking mutant phenotypes to address: What minimal molecular features define each organelle? How do organelles maintain identity while exchanging material? What molecular codes specify contact site formation? We will apply machine learning to predict organellar localization from molecular features, use network analysis to map inter-organellar dependencies, and integrate structural data to understand contact site architecture. This work addresses fundamental questions about cellular compartmentalization that require integration of proteomics, lipidomics, imaging, and trafficking data across all organelle systems—a scope exceeding individual laboratories. The collaborative framework is essential for standardizing organellar datasets and developing pan-organelle analytical approaches. Deliverables include a comprehensive organelle molecular atlas, prediction tools for protein localization and contact site formation, curated databases of organellar markers and contact site components, standardized multi-organelle analysis pipelines, and interdisciplinary training modules. This resource will transform understanding of cellular organization and reveal new mechanisms of organelle-related diseases.",,"Background And Significance

Eukaryotic cells are defined by their compartmentalization into membrane-bound organelles, each performing specialized biochemical functions essential for cellular homeostasis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, endosomes, and plasma membrane form an interconnected network that coordinates metabolism, signaling, and macromolecular synthesis. Despite decades of research, fundamental questions remain about how organelles establish and maintain their distinct molecular identities while simultaneously engaging in extensive material exchange and communication. Understanding these principles is critical for deciphering cellular organization and dysfunction in disease states including neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and cancer.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented datasets characterizing organellar composition and dynamics. Organelle-specific proteomics using proximity labeling (APEX, BioID) and immunoisolation have catalogued thousands of proteins across subcellular compartments. Studies such as the Human Protein Atlas, organelle proteomics from the Mann and Lamond laboratories, and spatial proteomics datasets from hyperLOPIT have provided comprehensive protein localization maps. Similarly, lipidomics studies have revealed that organelles possess distinctive lipid compositions, with specific enrichments of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane, cardiolipin in mitochondria, and phosphatidylinositol phosphates marking endosomal compartments. These lipid signatures are increasingly recognized as critical determinants of organelle identity and function.

Parallel advances in imaging have revealed that organelles do not function in isolation but form extensive physical contacts termed membrane contact sites (MCS). Electron microscopy tomography and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy have documented ER-mitochondria, ER-plasma membrane, ER-endosome, and mitochondria-lysosome contacts. These contact sites facilitate lipid transfer, calcium signaling, organelle fission, and metabolite exchange without membrane fusion. Molecular tethering complexes such as ERMES (ER-mitochondria encounter structure) and extended synaptotagmins have been identified, yet the complete repertoire of contact site machinery and the molecular codes specifying their formation remain poorly characterized.

Despite this wealth of data, several critical gaps limit our understanding of organelle biology. First, organellar datasets are highly heterogeneous, generated using different cell types, purification methods, and analytical platforms, making systematic comparisons challenging. Second, most studies focus on single organelles in isolation, missing the systems-level view necessary to understand inter-organellar dependencies and communication networks. Third, the relationship between molecular composition (proteins and lipids) and organellar identity remains unclear—we lack quantitative frameworks to predict which molecular features are necessary and sufficient for organelle specification. Fourth, while individual contact sites have been characterized, we lack comprehensive understanding of the molecular grammar governing contact site formation across all organelle pairs.

This synthesis project addresses these gaps by integrating diverse publicly available datasets to decode the molecular logic of organelle identity and crosstalk. The project is timely for several reasons. First, sufficient high-quality organellar datasets now exist across multiple organisms and cell types to enable robust comparative analyses. Second, advances in machine learning and network analysis provide powerful tools for extracting organizing principles from complex multi-dimensional data. Third, the cell biology community increasingly recognizes that organelles function as integrated networks rather than isolated compartments, necessitating pan-organelle analytical approaches. Fourth, understanding organelle dysfunction is critical for addressing diseases ranging from Parkinson's disease (mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction) to fatty liver disease (ER-lipid droplet dysregulation).

The scope of this project—integrating proteomics, lipidomics, imaging, trafficking, and structural data across all major organelle systems—exceeds the capacity of individual laboratories and requires transdisciplinary collaboration. Cell biologists bring expertise in organelle function and trafficking pathways; lipid biochemists contribute knowledge of membrane composition and lipid metabolism; membrane trafficking experts provide insights into vesicular and non-vesicular transport; computational biologists enable sophisticated data integration and predictive modeling. This collaborative synthesis will generate transformative resources and conceptual frameworks that redefine our understanding of cellular compartmentalization and establish new paradigms for studying organelle-related diseases.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three fundamental, interconnected research questions about organelle biology that require integration of diverse molecular and cellular datasets:

Research Question 1: What are the minimal molecular features that define organelle identity across cell types and organisms? We hypothesize that organelle identity is determined by a core set of protein and lipid molecular signatures that remain invariant across cellular contexts, supplemented by cell-type-specific adaptations. We predict that machine learning analysis of organellar proteomes and lipidomes will identify a minimal feature set (comprising 50-200 proteins and 10-20 lipid species per organelle) that accurately predicts organellar localization with >90% accuracy. We further hypothesize that these identity-determining features will include: (1) resident enzymes defining organellar biochemical functions, (2) membrane-shaping proteins establishing organellar morphology, (3) signature lipids creating distinct membrane environments, and (4) trafficking machinery controlling protein and lipid delivery. Testing this hypothesis requires comparative analysis of organellar compositions across diverse cell types (epithelial, neuronal, immune, metabolic) and organisms (yeast, plants, mammals) to distinguish core versus adaptive features. We will validate predictions by examining whether loss-of-function mutations in predicted identity determinants cause organellar dysfunction or mis-localization in published genetic screens.

Research Question 2: How do organelles maintain distinct molecular identities while simultaneously exchanging material through vesicular trafficking and contact sites? We hypothesize that organelles employ multiple molecular mechanisms to preserve identity during material exchange: (1) selective retention of identity-determining proteins through membrane anchoring or oligomerization, (2) rapid recycling of transiently visiting proteins via trafficking machinery, (3) lipid homeostatic mechanisms that restore signature lipid compositions after transfer events, and (4) quality control systems that remove mis-localized components. We predict that network analysis of trafficking pathways will reveal that identity-determining proteins exhibit low trafficking flux and high organellar residence times, while cargo proteins show high flux and transient localization. We further predict that organelles connected by high trafficking flux (e.g., ER-Golgi, Golgi-endosomes) will employ more robust identity maintenance mechanisms than organelles with limited exchange. Testing this hypothesis requires integrating trafficking pathway databases (COPI/COPII/clathrin cargo datasets), protein turnover data, and organellar proteomics to quantify protein flux between compartments. We will analyze correlations between trafficking flux and molecular similarity between organelle pairs, and examine whether perturbations disrupting trafficking (from published mutant datasets) cause organellar identity defects.

Research Question 3: What molecular codes specify membrane contact site formation between specific organelle pairs? We hypothesize that contact site formation is governed by combinatorial molecular codes involving: (1) complementary tethering proteins on apposing membranes, (2) specific lipid compositions that recruit tethering machinery, (3) membrane curvature and physical properties enabling close apposition, and (4) regulatory proteins responding to metabolic or signaling cues. We predict that machine learning models trained on known contact site components will identify novel tethering complexes and reveal common structural motifs (e.g., lipid-binding domains, coiled-coil dimerization domains) enriched in contact site proteins. We further predict that contact site formation follows hierarchical rules, with certain organelle pairs (e.g., ER-mitochondria, ER-plasma membrane) forming constitutive contacts while others (e.g., mitochondria-lysosomes) form regulated contacts under specific conditions. Testing this hypothesis requires integrating contact site proteomics, EM tomography data quantifying contact site abundance, lipidomics data from contact site-enriched fractions, and structural databases to identify molecular features associated with tethering function. We will validate predictions by examining whether predicted contact site proteins co-localize at organellar interfaces in published imaging datasets and whether their depletion disrupts contact site formation in published functional studies.

Expected Outcomes: We expect to deliver: (1) quantitative molecular signatures defining each major organelle with statistical confidence measures, (2) predictive models for protein localization achieving >90% accuracy, (3) comprehensive maps of inter-organellar trafficking networks with flux quantification, (4) curated databases of contact site components for all organelle pairs with evidence codes, (5) identification of 50-100 novel candidate contact site proteins, (6) molecular rules governing contact site formation validated against experimental data, and (7) integrated multi-organelle atlases linking composition, trafficking, and contact sites. These outcomes will be validated through comparison with held-out datasets, cross-validation across organisms, and consistency with published functional studies. The synthesis approach is essential because no single laboratory possesses expertise across proteomics, lipidomics, trafficking, imaging, and computational analysis, nor access to the comprehensive datasets required to address these pan-organelle questions.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse publicly available datasets through a systematic, multi-phase analytical approach combining data curation, statistical analysis, machine learning, network modeling, and structural bioinformatics.

Data Sources and Curation (Months 1-6): We will compile comprehensive datasets spanning organellar composition, trafficking, contact sites, and morphology. Proteomic data sources include: Human Protein Atlas subcellular localization data (>12,000 proteins), organelle-specific proteomics from hyperLOPIT spatial proteomics (Christoforou et al., Itzhak et al.), proximity labeling datasets (APEX/BioID studies from Rhee, Roux, and Ting laboratories), immunoisolation proteomics from mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, and peroxisomes (>50 published datasets), and yeast organellar proteomes from systematic localization studies. Lipidomics data sources include: organelle-specific lipidomics from Shevchenko laboratory, LIPID MAPS database, contact site-enriched membrane fractions, and lipid trafficking mutant phenotypes. Imaging data sources include: EM tomography repositories (EMDB, Cell Image Library) documenting contact sites, super-resolution microscopy datasets of organellar markers, and morphological measurements from high-content screening. Trafficking data sources include: COPI/COPII/clathrin cargo databases, vesicular transport mutant phenotypes from yeast and mammalian genetic screens, protein turnover measurements, and Rab GTPase localization and interaction data. Structural data sources include: AlphaFold protein structure predictions, membrane protein topology databases, lipid-binding domain annotations, and contact site tethering complex structures from PDB. A dedicated data curation team will standardize datasets, implement quality control filters, harmonize protein identifiers across databases, and create unified data structures enabling cross-dataset integration. All curated data will be deposited in public repositories with comprehensive metadata.

Analytical Approach - Phase 1: Defining Organelle Molecular Signatures (Months 4-12): We will apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to organellar proteomes and lipidomes to visualize organellar clustering and identify discriminating features. Feature selection algorithms (random forests, LASSO regression, mutual information) will identify minimal protein and lipid sets distinguishing each organelle. We will develop multi-class machine learning classifiers (gradient boosting, support vector machines, neural networks) to predict organellar localization from molecular features, using cross-validation and held-out test sets to assess performance. Comparative analysis across cell types and organisms will distinguish core versus adaptive signatures using meta-analysis frameworks. We will quantify organellar molecular similarity using Jaccard indices, cosine similarity, and correlation metrics to create organellar relationship maps. Statistical significance will be assessed using permutation tests and false discovery rate correction. Uncertainty quantification will employ bootstrap resampling and Bayesian approaches.

Analytical Approach - Phase 2: Mapping Inter-Organellar Trafficking Networks (Months 10-18): We will construct directed networks where nodes represent organelles and edges represent trafficking flux, weighted by cargo abundance and trafficking rates. Network analysis will quantify connectivity, identify trafficking hubs, and detect community structure using graph theory algorithms. We will integrate protein turnover data with organellar proteomics to estimate residence times and trafficking kinetics using compartmental modeling. Comparison of trafficking flux with molecular similarity will test whether high-flux organelle pairs maintain distinct identities through active mechanisms. We will analyze trafficking mutant phenotypes to identify perturbations causing organellar identity defects, using enrichment analysis to link specific trafficking pathways to identity maintenance. Dynamic modeling will simulate material exchange and identity maintenance using ordinary differential equations parameterized by experimental data.

Analytical Approach - Phase 3: Decoding Contact Site Molecular Codes (Months 16-24): We will compile comprehensive contact site protein inventories from proximity labeling and biochemical fractionation studies. Sequence analysis will identify enriched protein domains, motifs, and structural features in contact site proteins using PFAM, InterPro, and de novo motif discovery. We will develop machine learning models (random forests, deep learning) to predict contact site localization from sequence and structural features, training on known tethering proteins and validating on independent datasets. Integration of contact site proteomics with EM tomography will correlate molecular composition with contact site abundance and morphology using regression analysis. Lipidomics integration will identify lipid species associated with contact site formation using correlation analysis and lipid-protein interaction predictions. Network analysis will map contact site protein interaction networks and identify core versus accessory components using community detection algorithms. We will generate testable predictions of novel contact site proteins and tethering mechanisms, validated against published imaging and functional datasets.

Integration and Validation (Months 20-30): We will develop integrated multi-organelle atlases linking composition, trafficking, and contact sites through relational databases and interactive visualization platforms. Cross-validation will assess consistency across datasets, organisms, and analytical methods. We will benchmark predictions against published functional studies, genetic screens, and localization databases. Sensitivity analysis will assess robustness to data quality and analytical parameters. We will engage the community through workshops to refine analyses and validate biological interpretations.

Timeline and Milestones: Months 1-6: Data curation and database construction; Months 4-12: Organelle signature identification and localization prediction models; Months 10-18: Trafficking network analysis and identity maintenance mechanisms; Months 16-24: Contact site molecular code discovery; Months 20-30: Integration, validation, and resource deployment; Months 24-36: Manuscript preparation, community engagement, and training activities. The collaborative team structure enables parallel progress across analytical phases with regular integration meetings ensuring coherence.

In structural biology, identifying contact site tethering mechanisms will guide structural determination of inter-organellar bridges. In systems biology, our network models will provide quantitative frameworks for understanding cellular organization as an integrated system. In medicine, understanding organellar dysfunction mechanisms will reveal therapeutic targets for diseases including neurodegeneration (mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease), metabolic disorders (ER-mitochondria contact site disruption in diabetes), lipid storage diseases (peroxisome-ER communication defects), and cancer (altered organellar trafficking in metastasis). Our predictive models will enable identification of disease-causing mutations affecting organellar localization and contact site formation. The resources will accelerate drug discovery by identifying organelle-specific proteins as therapeutic targets and predicting off-target effects on cellular organization.

This synthesis project will integrate comparative genomics, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, enhancer databases, and developmental expression data across metazoan phylogeny to understand how regulatory elements evolve and drive phenotypic innovation. By uniting evolutionary developmental biologists, genomicists, computational biologists, and population geneticists, we will analyze regulatory element birth, death, and modification across species to identify mechanisms of regulatory innovation. The project will synthesize data from ENCODE, modENCODE, VISTA Enhancer Browser, comparative genomics databases, and developmental atlases across diverse animals to address: How do new regulatory elements arise? What sequence features enable regulatory innovation? How do regulatory changes produce morphological novelty? We will develop computational frameworks to align regulatory elements across divergent genomes, apply phylogenetic methods to reconstruct regulatory element evolution, and correlate regulatory changes with phenotypic innovations. This work addresses fundamental questions about evolutionary mechanisms that require integration of functional genomics, comparative genomics, and developmental biology data across broad phylogenetic sampling—capabilities beyond individual laboratories. The synthesis demands expertise in regulatory genomics, phylogenetics, and developmental biology. Outputs include an evolutionary regulatory atlas mapping element origins and modifications, tools for comparative regulatory genomics, curated datasets of lineage-specific regulatory innovations, standardized workflows for regulatory evolution analysis, and training programs bridging evolution and genomics. This resource will reveal how regulatory evolution generates biological diversity and provide frameworks for understanding human regulatory variation and disease.",,"Background And Significance

The extraordinary morphological diversity observed across the animal kingdom—from the segmented body plans of arthropods to the complex neural architectures of vertebrates—represents one of biology's most profound puzzles. While early molecular biology focused on protein-coding sequences as the primary drivers of evolutionary change, decades of research have revealed that morphological innovation arises predominantly through alterations in gene regulation rather than changes in protein structure. This paradigm shift, articulated by King and Wilson in 1975 and substantiated by countless subsequent studies, positions cis-regulatory elements (CREs)—enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators—as the primary substrates of evolutionary innovation. Despite this fundamental insight, our understanding of how regulatory elements evolve to generate phenotypic diversity remains fragmentary and incomplete.

Recent advances in functional genomics have generated unprecedented volumes of regulatory data across diverse species. The ENCODE project and its model organism counterparts (modENCODE for Drosophila and C. elegans) have systematically mapped regulatory elements in multiple species, providing comprehensive catalogs of enhancers, promoters, and transcription factor binding sites. Complementary resources including the VISTA Enhancer Browser, which contains experimentally validated enhancers tested in transgenic mice, and numerous ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq datasets deposited in public repositories, offer rich opportunities for comparative analysis. Simultaneously, whole-genome sequencing efforts have produced high-quality assemblies for hundreds of metazoan species spanning major phylogenetic transitions, while developmental expression atlases document spatiotemporal gene expression patterns across embryogenesis in multiple organisms. These data resources, generated independently by numerous research communities, remain largely unintegrated, representing a critical missed opportunity for synthesis.

Current research on regulatory evolution faces several fundamental limitations. First, most studies focus on pairwise comparisons between closely related species (typically human-mouse or Drosophila species pairs), limiting our ability to understand deep evolutionary patterns and mechanisms of regulatory innovation across major phylogenetic transitions. Second, existing computational approaches for identifying homologous regulatory elements across species rely primarily on sequence conservation, which fails to detect functionally equivalent elements that have diverged in sequence or newly evolved elements lacking detectable homology. Third, the relationship between regulatory element evolution and phenotypic innovation remains largely correlative rather than mechanistic, with few studies systematically linking regulatory changes to specific morphological novelties across broad phylogenetic scales. Fourth, we lack comprehensive frameworks for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which new regulatory elements arise—whether through exaptation of transposable elements, duplication and divergence, de novo emergence from non-functional sequence, or other mechanisms.

Several recent studies highlight both the promise and limitations of current approaches. Villar et al. (2015) compared enhancer landscapes across mammals, revealing extensive regulatory turnover even among conserved developmental genes, but their analysis was limited to a single vertebrate class. Shubin et al. (2009) demonstrated how regulatory changes in limb development genes contributed to fin-to-limb transitions, but lacked genome-wide perspective. Kvon et al. (2016) showed that enhancer activity can be gained and lost rapidly even when sequence is conserved, highlighting the inadequacy of sequence-based approaches alone. These studies underscore the need for integrative, phylogenetically broad synthesis that combines functional genomic data with comparative genomic analysis and phenotypic information.

This research is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exist in public repositories but remain unintegrated, representing a critical synthesis opportunity. Second, computational methods for analyzing regulatory evolution have matured sufficiently to enable cross-species comparisons at unprecedented scales. Third, understanding regulatory evolution has immediate translational relevance, as most disease-associated genetic variants in humans fall within regulatory regions, and evolutionary approaches can help prioritize functional variants. Finally, this synthesis addresses fundamental questions about evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be answered through experimental approaches alone, requiring integration of data across species, developmental stages, and biological scales—precisely the type of community-scale synthesis that NCEMS supports. By bringing together diverse expertise and data resources, this project will transform our understanding of how regulatory evolution generates biological diversity and establish frameworks for future research in evolutionary genomics.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our understanding of regulatory evolution and phenotypic innovation.

Research Question 1: How do new cis-regulatory elements arise and what are the relative contributions of different mechanisms to regulatory innovation across metazoan evolution? We hypothesize that regulatory element birth occurs through multiple distinct mechanisms whose relative importance varies across phylogenetic lineages and genomic contexts. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) transposable element exaptation contributes disproportionately to regulatory innovation in mammalian lineages compared to invertebrates, reflecting differences in transposable element activity and diversity; (H1b) regulatory element duplication and divergence predominates near developmental transcription factors, where modular enhancer architecture facilitates subfunctionalization; (H1c) de novo emergence from previously non-functional sequence occurs at measurable rates and correlates with regions of high mutation rate and relaxed constraint; and (H1d) enhancer hijacking through chromosomal rearrangements contributes to regulatory innovation at major phylogenetic transitions associated with body plan changes. We will test these hypotheses by systematically classifying regulatory elements across 50+ metazoan species according to their evolutionary origins, using phylogenetic analysis to infer birth mechanisms, and correlating mechanism frequencies with lineage-specific features and phenotypic innovations. Expected outcomes include quantitative estimates of mechanism frequencies across phylogeny, identification of genomic and phylogenetic contexts favoring specific mechanisms, and catalogs of regulatory innovations associated with major evolutionary transitions.

Research Question 2: What sequence features and evolutionary processes enable regulatory elements to gain, modify, or lose function, and how do these changes propagate through regulatory networks? We hypothesize that regulatory evolution operates through predictable sequence-level changes that alter transcription factor binding affinity, cooperative interactions, and chromatin accessibility. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) gain of regulatory function correlates with acquisition of transcription factor binding site clusters matching developmental expression domains, with specific motif combinations predicting tissue-specific activity; (H2b) regulatory element turnover (loss in one lineage, gain in another controlling the same gene) maintains expression patterns through compensatory changes, with turnover rates varying by gene function and expression breadth; (H2c) modifications to existing regulatory elements occur preferentially through changes in spacing and affinity of transcription factor binding sites rather than complete motif gain/loss, enabling fine-tuning of expression levels; and (H2d) regulatory innovations propagate through networks via preferential rewiring of hub transcription factors that control multiple downstream targets. We will test these hypotheses through comprehensive sequence analysis of aligned regulatory elements across species, machine learning approaches to predict regulatory activity from sequence, phylogenetic reconstruction of regulatory network evolution, and correlation of sequence changes with expression pattern modifications documented in developmental atlases. Expected outcomes include predictive models linking sequence features to regulatory function, quantification of regulatory turnover rates across gene categories, identification of sequence signatures associated with regulatory innovation, and network-level understanding of how regulatory changes propagate.

Research Question 3: How do regulatory changes produce specific morphological novelties, and can we establish general principles linking regulatory evolution to phenotypic innovation? We hypothesize that morphological innovations arise through stereotyped patterns of regulatory evolution affecting specific categories of developmental genes. Our predictions are: (H3a) major morphological innovations (e.g., vertebrate neural crest, insect wings, tetrapod limbs) associate with bursts of regulatory element gain affecting batteries of co-expressed developmental genes rather than isolated regulatory changes; (H3b) regulatory changes producing morphological novelty preferentially affect genes encoding transcription factors and signaling molecules rather than terminal differentiation genes, reflecting hierarchical organization of developmental programs; (H3c) heterochronic shifts (changes in developmental timing) result from regulatory modifications affecting temporal enhancers, with predictable sequence signatures; and (H3d) convergent morphological evolution involves parallel regulatory changes affecting orthologous genes through similar molecular mechanisms. We will test these hypotheses by systematically correlating regulatory innovations with documented morphological novelties across metazoan phylogeny, analyzing the functional categories and network positions of genes with lineage-specific regulatory changes, reconstructing the temporal sequence of regulatory modifications associated with major innovations, and identifying cases of convergent regulatory evolution. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive catalog linking specific regulatory changes to morphological innovations, general principles governing the relationship between regulatory and phenotypic evolution, identification of developmental genes and pathways most susceptible to regulatory innovation, and frameworks for predicting phenotypic consequences of regulatory changes.

Validation of these hypotheses will occur through multiple complementary approaches: cross-validation using held-out species and regulatory elements, comparison with experimentally validated enhancers from transgenic assays, consistency checks across independent datasets (e.g., ATAC-seq vs. ChIP-seq), and where possible, comparison with published experimental studies of regulatory evolution. The integration of predictions across all three research questions will provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms, patterns, and consequences of regulatory evolution across metazoan diversity.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types across broad phylogenetic sampling through a comprehensive analytical pipeline organized into five interconnected phases, executed over a three-year timeline.

Phase 1: Data Integration and Harmonization (Months 1-6). We will compile and standardize regulatory genomics data from multiple public repositories. Primary data sources include: (1) ENCODE and modENCODE datasets providing ChIP-seq for histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3) and transcription factors, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq across human, mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans; (2) VISTA Enhancer Browser containing 3,000+ experimentally validated enhancers tested in transgenic mice; (3) published ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq datasets from 40+ additional metazoan species retrieved from GEO, ENA, and DDBJ; (4) whole-genome alignments and assemblies from UCSC, Ensembl, and NCBI for 50+ metazoan species spanning major phylogenetic transitions (sponges, cnidarians, ecdysozoans, lophotrochozoans, deuterostomes); (5) developmental expression atlases including FlyBase, WormBase, ZFIN, MGI, and published single-cell RNA-seq developmental time courses; and (6) transposable element annotations from Dfam and RepBase. We will develop standardized pipelines to process raw sequencing data uniformly, call regulatory elements using consistent peak-calling parameters (MACS2 for ChIP-seq, HMMRATAC for ATAC-seq), and annotate elements with genomic context, nearby genes, and predicted transcription factor binding sites using FIMO and JASPAR motif databases. All processed data will be stored in a unified database with standardized metadata following FAIR principles.

Phase 2: Cross-Species Regulatory Element Alignment and Homology Inference (Months 4-12). We will develop and apply computational frameworks to identify homologous and analogous regulatory elements across divergent species. For closely related species (e.g., within mammals or Drosophila), we will use whole-genome alignments to project regulatory elements and assess conservation. For divergent comparisons, we will implement a multi-faceted approach: (1) synteny-based methods identifying regulatory elements near orthologous genes in conserved genomic neighborhoods; (2) sequence similarity searches using relaxed BLAST parameters to detect partial homology; (3) machine learning classifiers (trained on known homologous enhancers) that predict functional equivalence based on sequence features, chromatin state, and expression patterns of nearby genes; and (4) network-based approaches identifying regulatory elements controlling orthologous genes with similar expression patterns, even without sequence similarity. We will apply phylogenetic methods to reconstruct regulatory element evolutionary histories, inferring birth, death, and modification events across the metazoan tree. This phase produces aligned regulatory element datasets with inferred homology relationships and evolutionary trajectories.

Phase 3: Mechanism Classification and Sequence Feature Analysis (Months 10-20). We will systematically classify regulatory element origins and analyze sequence features enabling regulatory function. For each regulatory element birth event, we will determine mechanism through: (1) overlap with transposable element annotations indicating exaptation; (2) phylogenetic analysis revealing duplication from existing elements; (3) absence of homology suggesting de novo emergence; and (4) synteny breaks indicating chromosomal rearrangement. We will develop machine learning models (gradient boosting and deep learning architectures) to predict regulatory activity from sequence, training on experimentally validated enhancers and testing on held-out species. Feature importance analysis will identify sequence characteristics (motif content, spacing, GC content, nucleosome positioning signals) most predictive of regulatory function. We will apply phylogenetic comparative methods to test correlations between regulatory innovation rates and lineage-specific traits (genome size, transposable element load, developmental complexity). For regulatory element modifications, we will perform detailed sequence analysis comparing orthologous elements across species, quantifying changes in transcription factor binding sites, motif affinity, and spacing. This phase produces mechanism classifications for thousands of regulatory elements, predictive models of regulatory function, and quantitative understanding of sequence features enabling regulatory innovation.

Phase 4: Network Evolution and Phenotype Correlation (Months 16-28). We will reconstruct regulatory network evolution and correlate regulatory changes with morphological innovations. Using developmental expression data, we will infer gene regulatory networks for each species, identifying transcription factors, their target genes, and regulatory interactions. Phylogenetic analysis will reveal network rewiring events—gains and losses of regulatory interactions across evolution. We will test whether regulatory innovations cluster in specific network contexts (e.g., affecting hub transcription factors) and whether network topology constrains or facilitates regulatory evolution. To link regulatory changes with phenotypic innovations, we will compile a comprehensive database of morphological characters across our species sampling, drawing on published phylogenetic character matrices and anatomical databases. For major innovations (vertebrate neural crest, insect wings, arthropod segmentation, etc.), we will identify the phylogenetic branch where the innovation arose and systematically catalog regulatory changes on that branch, testing for enrichment of regulatory gains affecting specific gene categories. We will develop statistical frameworks to assess significance of regulatory-phenotype associations while controlling for phylogenetic non-independence. This phase produces evolutionary regulatory networks, catalogs of regulatory changes associated with morphological innovations, and statistical tests of regulatory-phenotypic associations.

Phase 5: Tool Development, Validation, and Dissemination (Months 24-36). We will develop user-friendly computational tools and resources for the research community. Deliverables include: (1) an Evolutionary Regulatory Atlas—a web-accessible database and genome browser displaying regulatory elements, their evolutionary histories, and associated phenotypes across all analyzed species; (2) software packages for cross-species regulatory element alignment, mechanism classification, and regulatory network reconstruction, distributed through GitHub and Bioconductor; (3) standardized workflows and tutorials for regulatory evolution analysis, documented through protocols.io; and (4) curated datasets of lineage-specific regulatory innovations with associated metadata.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes advancing multiple fields while establishing new paradigms for studying regulatory evolution and training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

Primary Scientific Outcomes: The project will produce an Evolutionary Regulatory Atlas—the first comprehensive resource mapping regulatory element origins, modifications, and losses across metazoan phylogeny. This atlas will contain annotations for 100,000+ regulatory elements across 50+ species, with inferred evolutionary histories, mechanism classifications, sequence features, and associated phenotypes. This resource will enable researchers to explore regulatory evolution at unprecedented scale, identifying regulatory changes associated with any morphological innovation or phylogenetic transition of interest. We will generate quantitative estimates of regulatory element birth and death rates across phylogeny, revealing how regulatory innovation varies across lineages and correlates with morphological complexity. Our mechanism classification will establish the relative contributions of transposable element exaptation, duplication, de novo emergence, and other processes to regulatory innovation, resolving long-standing questions about regulatory element origins. The sequence feature analysis will produce predictive models linking DNA sequence to regulatory function across species, advancing our ability to interpret non-coding genome sequences and identify functional regulatory variants. Our network evolution analysis will reveal general principles of regulatory network rewiring, showing how regulatory changes propagate through developmental programs and whether network topology constrains evolutionary trajectories. Most significantly, our systematic correlation of regulatory changes with morphological innovations will establish causal links between molecular and phenotypic evolution, identifying specific regulatory modifications underlying major evolutionary transitions such as vertebrate origins, insect diversification, and tetrapod terrestrialization.

Methodological Advances: The project will develop novel computational frameworks for comparative regulatory genomics that overcome current limitations. Our cross-species alignment methods will enable identification of functionally equivalent regulatory elements even without sequence conservation, opening new avenues for studying regulatory evolution across divergent taxa. The machine learning models predicting regulatory activity from sequence will be trained on unprecedented phylogenetic breadth, improving generalization beyond model organisms. Our integration of regulatory genomics, comparative genomics, developmental expression data, and phenotypic information represents a new paradigm for synthesis research, demonstrating how diverse data types can be unified to address fundamental biological questions. All methods will be implemented as open-source software with comprehensive documentation, enabling other researchers to apply these approaches to their systems of interest. The standardized workflows will establish best practices for regulatory evolution analysis, promoting reproducibility and facilitating future studies.

Broader Impacts: Understanding regulatory evolution has profound implications beyond evolutionary biology. In human genetics, most disease-associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies fall within regulatory regions, yet interpreting their functional significance remains challenging. Our evolutionary framework will help prioritize functional regulatory variants by identifying sequences under evolutionary constraint or showing signatures of adaptive evolution. The predictive models of regulatory function will aid interpretation of personal genomes and precision medicine efforts. In synthetic biology and biotechnology, understanding how regulatory elements evolve and what sequence features enable regulatory function will inform design of synthetic regulatory circuits and engineering of gene expression systems. In conservation biology, identifying regulatory changes underlying adaptive traits will help predict species' evolutionary potential and inform conservation strategies. The project will also advance agricultural applications by revealing regulatory mechanisms underlying domestication traits and providing frameworks for crop improvement through regulatory modification.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train 6-8 graduate students and postdocs in interdisciplinary synthesis research, bridging evolutionary biology, genomics, and computational biology. Trainees will gain expertise in data integration, comparative genomics, machine learning, and phylogenetic methods while developing collaborative skills through team-based research. We will organize annual workshops providing hands-on training in regulatory evolution analysis for 20-30 participants from diverse institutions, with priority for early-career researchers and underrepresented groups. Workshop materials will be made publicly available, extending impact beyond direct participants. We will develop online tutorials and video lectures demonstrating use of our tools and resources, creating lasting educational materials. Trainees will be encouraged to present work at conferences, publish first-author papers, and develop independent research directions, preparing them for careers in academia, industry, or government.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: Results will be disseminated through multiple channels to maximize impact. We will publish 8-10 papers in high-impact journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Genome Research, and Molecular Biology and Evolution, with preprints posted to bioRxiv upon submission. The Evolutionary Regulatory Atlas will be released as a web-accessible resource with genome browser interface, REST API, and bulk download options. All software will be distributed through GitHub with comprehensive documentation and deposited in permanent repositories (Zenodo) with DOIs. Datasets will be deposited in appropriate repositories (GEO, Dryad, FigShare) with rich metadata. We will present findings at major conferences (SMBE, Evolution, CSHL meetings) and organize symposia highlighting synthesis approaches. We will engage with science communicators to disseminate findings to broader audiences through press releases, blog posts, and social media.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes foundations for ongoing research in regulatory evolution. The Evolutionary Regulatory Atlas will be maintained beyond the funding period through partnerships with existing genome databases (UCSC, Ensembl) and commitment of institutional resources. The computational frameworks will enable future expansion as new species are sequenced and additional regulatory data become available. We will establish a user community through mailing lists, forums, and regular webinars, ensuring continued engagement and collaborative development. The project will catalyze new collaborations between evolutionary biologists and functional genomicists, fostering integration of these traditionally separate fields. Ultimately, this synthesis will transform our understanding of how regulatory evolution generates biological diversity, establishing new paradigms for studying genotype-phenotype relationships and revealing fundamental principles governing evolutionary innovation.

This synthesis project will integrate mechanobiology datasets, structural databases of mechanosensitive proteins, force spectroscopy measurements, mechanically-induced transcriptomics, and cytoskeletal dynamics data to understand how cells convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals. By bringing together mechanobiologists, structural biologists, biophysicists, and cell signaling experts, we will analyze molecular mechanisms of force sensing across proteins, pathways, and cell types. The project will synthesize data from atomic force microscopy studies, molecular dynamics simulations of mechanosensitive proteins, mechanically-stimulated omics datasets, and cytoskeletal protein databases to address: What molecular features enable force sensing? How do mechanical signals propagate to transcriptional responses? What determines force sensitivity thresholds? We will develop structure-based models of mechanosensitive protein conformational changes, integrate mechanical stimulation data with signaling pathway activation, and apply network analysis to map mechanotransduction cascades. This addresses fundamental questions about mechanical regulation that require integration of biophysical measurements, structural data, omics profiling, and signaling networks—expertise rarely combined in single laboratories. The synthesis demands infrastructure for integrating force measurements with molecular and cellular data. Deliverables include a mechanotransduction atlas mapping force-sensitive molecules and pathways, predictive models for mechanosensitive protein behavior, tools for integrating mechanical and biochemical data, standardized analysis protocols, and interdisciplinary training in mechanobiology. This work will reveal design principles of cellular force sensing and inform therapeutic strategies for mechanically-driven diseases including fibrosis and cardiovascular disorders.",,"Background And Significance

Mechanical forces are fundamental regulators of cellular behavior, influencing processes from embryonic development to tissue homeostasis and disease progression. Cells continuously experience mechanical stimuli including tension, compression, shear stress, and substrate stiffness, which they convert into biochemical signals through mechanotransduction. Despite decades of research identifying key mechanosensitive proteins and pathways, we lack a comprehensive molecular understanding of how cells sense forces and translate them into specific biological responses. This knowledge gap represents a critical barrier to understanding normal physiology and developing therapeutic interventions for mechanically-driven diseases.

Recent advances have identified numerous mechanosensitive proteins including ion channels (Piezo1/2, TRP channels), adhesion complexes (integrins, focal adhesion proteins), cytoskeletal elements (actin, intermediate filaments), nuclear envelope proteins (lamins, emerin), and membrane-associated proteins (caveolae, spectrin networks). However, these discoveries have emerged from disparate experimental approaches across multiple disciplines, creating fragmented knowledge that has not been systematically integrated. Structural biology has revealed conformational changes in mechanosensitive proteins under force, biophysical studies have measured force thresholds and kinetics, transcriptomic analyses have identified mechanically-responsive genes, and cell biology has mapped signaling cascades. Yet these datasets remain largely siloed, preventing comprehensive understanding of mechanotransduction as an integrated system.

Several fundamental questions remain unresolved. First, what molecular features confer force sensitivity? While some mechanosensitive domains have been identified, we lack predictive frameworks for identifying force-sensing capabilities from protein structure. Second, how do mechanical signals propagate from sensors to transcriptional responses? The intermediate signaling steps connecting membrane mechanosensors to nuclear gene regulation remain incompletely mapped. Third, what determines force sensitivity thresholds across different cell types and contexts? Understanding this specificity is crucial for explaining why identical mechanical stimuli produce different cellular responses.

The importance of mechanotransduction extends across multiple biological contexts and disease states. In cardiovascular disease, aberrant mechanical signaling contributes to hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. Fibrotic diseases including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and systemic sclerosis involve pathological responses to tissue stiffening. Cancer progression depends on mechanical interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment, with matrix stiffness promoting metastasis. Developmental disorders arise from disrupted mechanical signaling during morphogenesis. Despite this clinical significance, therapeutic targeting of mechanotransduction remains limited by incomplete molecular understanding.

This research is timely because multiple factors now enable comprehensive synthesis. First, extensive publicly available datasets exist across relevant domains: the Protein Data Bank contains thousands of mechanosensitive protein structures, Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress house hundreds of mechanically-stimulated transcriptomic datasets, and specialized repositories contain force spectroscopy measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. Second, computational tools for integrating heterogeneous data types have matured, including network analysis algorithms, machine learning approaches for structure-function prediction, and multi-scale modeling frameworks. Third, the mechanobiology community has reached critical mass with sufficient expertise distributed across disciplines to enable meaningful synthesis.

Previous efforts have been limited by single-lab capabilities and disciplinary boundaries. Individual laboratories typically possess expertise in one domain—structural biology, biophysics, or cell signaling—but lack the breadth required for comprehensive integration. Existing collaborations have addressed specific mechanotransduction pathways but have not attempted systematic synthesis across proteins, pathways, and cell types. This proposal addresses these limitations by assembling a transdisciplinary team with complementary expertise and leveraging NCEMS infrastructure to integrate diverse data types at scale. The synthesis approach will reveal emergent principles invisible within individual datasets, providing transformative insights into cellular force sensing mechanisms and establishing frameworks for future mechanobiology research.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our molecular understanding of mechanotransduction.

Research Question 1: What molecular features enable proteins to sense and respond to mechanical forces? We hypothesize that force-sensitive proteins share conserved structural motifs and biophysical properties that can be identified through integrated analysis of protein structures, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental force measurements. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Mechanosensitive proteins contain identifiable structural features including force-bearing domains with specific secondary structure compositions, flexible linker regions that undergo conformational changes under tension, and cryptic binding sites exposed by mechanical unfolding. (H1b) Force sensitivity correlates with specific biophysical parameters including domain stability, unfolding energy landscapes, and mechanical compliance that can be extracted from molecular dynamics trajectories. (H1c) Machine learning models trained on known mechanosensitive proteins can predict force-sensing capabilities from sequence and structure, enabling identification of novel mechanosensors. We will test these hypotheses by systematically analyzing structural databases, compiling force spectroscopy measurements from literature and repositories, integrating molecular dynamics simulation data, and developing predictive computational models. Expected outcomes include a catalog of mechanosensitive structural motifs, quantitative relationships between structural features and force sensitivity, and validated prediction tools for identifying mechanosensors.

Research Question 2: How do mechanical signals propagate from sensors to transcriptional responses? We hypothesize that mechanotransduction involves hierarchical signaling networks with identifiable intermediate nodes connecting membrane mechanosensors to nuclear transcriptional machinery. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) Mechanical stimulation activates conserved signaling modules including kinase cascades (FAK, Src, MAPK pathways), small GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42), and transcriptional regulators (YAP/TAZ, SRF, NF-κB) that can be mapped through integration of phosphoproteomics and transcriptomic datasets. (H2b) Different mechanosensors converge on common downstream pathways, with pathway selection determined by cell type, force magnitude, and temporal dynamics. (H2c) Mechanical signal propagation exhibits characteristic timescales from immediate sensor activation (milliseconds-seconds) through signaling cascade engagement (minutes) to transcriptional responses (hours), which can be resolved through temporal analysis of multi-omics datasets. We will test these hypotheses by integrating mechanically-stimulated transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic datasets; applying network analysis to identify signaling modules; and performing temporal correlation analysis to map signal flow. Expected outcomes include comprehensive mechanotransduction pathway maps, identification of key regulatory nodes, and quantitative models of signal propagation dynamics.

Research Question 3: What determines force sensitivity thresholds and cell-type-specific responses to mechanical stimuli? We hypothesize that force sensitivity is determined by the expression levels and post-translational modifications of mechanosensitive proteins, the mechanical properties of cellular structures, and the pre-existing signaling state of cells. Our predictions include: (H3a) Cell-type-specific mechanosensitivity correlates with differential expression of mechanosensitive proteins and their regulators, which can be identified through comparative transcriptomic analysis across cell types subjected to identical mechanical stimuli. (H3b) Force thresholds for pathway activation depend on the mechanical properties of force-bearing structures including focal adhesions, stress fibers, and nuclear architecture, which can be quantified by integrating cytoskeletal protein databases with mechanical measurements. (H3c) Cellular context including substrate stiffness, cell density, and biochemical signaling state modulates mechanosensitivity through crosstalk between mechanical and biochemical pathways. We will test these hypotheses by performing comparative analysis of mechanically-stimulated datasets across cell types, integrating expression data with force sensitivity measurements, and analyzing mechanochemical crosstalk through network modeling. Expected outcomes include predictive models for cell-type-specific mechanosensitivity, identification of key determinants of force thresholds, and frameworks for understanding context-dependent mechanical responses.

Validation of these hypotheses will occur through multiple approaches. Computational predictions will be validated against held-out experimental datasets not used in model training. Network models will be tested for their ability to predict responses to perturbations reported in literature. Structural predictions will be validated against newly deposited structures and experimental measurements. The synthesis will generate testable predictions for future experimental validation by the broader community. Collectively, addressing these questions will provide unprecedented molecular insight into cellular mechanosensing and establish frameworks for understanding mechanical regulation across biological contexts.

Our methodology leverages complementary expertise from mechanobiology, structural biology, biophysics, computational biology, and systems biology.

Data Sources and Compilation (Months 1-6): We will systematically compile datasets across five categories. First, structural data will be extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), focusing on mechanosensitive proteins including ion channels (Piezo1/2, TRP channels, mechanosensitive bacterial channels), adhesion proteins (integrins, talin, vinculin, α-actinin), cytoskeletal proteins (actin, spectrin, titin), and nuclear envelope proteins (lamins, SUN-KASH complexes). We will retrieve approximately 2,000 relevant structures with associated metadata. Second, molecular dynamics simulation data will be compiled from repositories including GPCRmd, MoDEL, and supplementary materials from publications, focusing on simulations of mechanosensitive proteins under applied forces. Third, force spectroscopy data will be extracted from literature and specialized databases, including atomic force microscopy measurements, optical trap experiments, and magnetic tweezer studies quantifying protein unfolding forces, domain stability, and mechanical compliance. Fourth, mechanically-stimulated omics datasets will be compiled from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and PRIDE, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic studies of cells subjected to stretch, compression, shear stress, or substrate stiffness variations. We will compile approximately 300 relevant datasets spanning multiple cell types and mechanical stimuli. Fifth, cytoskeletal and signaling pathway databases including STRING, KEGG, Reactome, and the Focal Adhesion Database will provide network context. All data will be standardized using common identifiers and stored in a centralized database with comprehensive metadata.

Structural Analysis and Mechanosensitive Feature Identification (Months 4-12): We will perform systematic structural analysis to identify force-sensing features. Structural alignment and comparison will identify conserved domains across mechanosensitive protein families. Secondary structure analysis will quantify the prevalence of specific motifs (β-sheets, α-helices, disordered regions) in force-bearing domains. Solvent accessibility calculations will identify cryptic binding sites potentially exposed by mechanical unfolding. Analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories will extract conformational changes under force, including domain rotations, unfolding pathways, and allosteric coupling between distant sites. We will calculate mechanical properties including domain stiffness, unfolding energy barriers, and force-extension relationships. Machine learning approaches including random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning will be trained on known mechanosensitive proteins to develop predictive models for force sensitivity based on sequence and structural features. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and testing on independent datasets.

Omics Data Integration and Pathway Mapping (Months 7-18): Mechanically-stimulated omics datasets will undergo standardized processing including quality control, normalization, and batch effect correction. Differential expression analysis will identify mechanically-responsive genes and proteins across datasets. Meta-analysis approaches will integrate findings across studies to identify robust mechanotransduction signatures. Temporal analysis will resolve the dynamics of mechanical responses from immediate-early genes through sustained transcriptional programs.

At the molecular scale, we will develop structure-based models of mechanosensitive protein conformational changes, incorporating force-extension relationships from simulations and experiments. At the pathway scale, we will construct quantitative models of signal propagation from mechanosensors through signaling cascades to transcriptional responses, parameterized using temporal omics data. At the cellular scale, we will develop network models integrating multiple mechanotransduction pathways and their crosstalk with biochemical signaling. Machine learning approaches including graph neural networks will integrate heterogeneous data types. We will develop a mechanotransduction atlas—a comprehensive, interactive resource mapping mechanosensitive proteins, their structural features, force sensitivities, downstream pathways, and cell-type-specific responses.

Validation and Tool Development (Months 19-30): Model predictions will be validated against independent datasets not used in training. We will develop open-source computational tools including: (1) a mechanosensitive protein prediction tool accepting protein sequences/structures as input; (2) a pathway analysis tool for mechanically-stimulated omics data; (3) visualization tools for the mechanotransduction atlas; and (4) standardized analysis protocols for integrating mechanical and biochemical data. All tools will be documented, tested, and released with tutorials.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1: Complete data compilation (Month 6), initial structural analysis (Month 12). Year 2: Complete pathway mapping (Month 18), develop integrated models (Month 24). Year 3: Finalize mechanotransduction atlas (Month 30), release tools and publications (Month 36). The project will hold quarterly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops, and maintain continuous communication through collaborative platforms. This approach requires NCEMS support for coordinating distributed expertise, providing computational infrastructure for large-scale data integration, and facilitating the transdisciplinary collaboration essential for synthesis.

This resource will reveal universal principles of cellular decision-making and enable rational control of cell fate for regenerative medicine and cancer therapy.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular fate decisions represent fundamental biological processes that determine tissue development, homeostasis, and disease progression. At critical junctures termed bifurcation points, cells transition from multipotent or plastic states to committed fates through molecular decision-making circuits. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for regenerative medicine, cancer therapy, and developmental biology, yet the principles governing robust yet reversible cellular decisions remain incompletely characterized. The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has generated unprecedented datasets capturing cellular states during fate transitions, creating an opportunity for synthesis research to extract universal principles of decision-making across biological contexts.

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that cell fate decisions occur through continuous trajectories rather than discrete jumps, with cells traversing intermediate states characterized by co-expression of alternative fate markers. Studies of hematopoietic differentiation, neural development, and embryonic lineage specification have identified transient primed states where cells exhibit molecular signatures of multiple fates before commitment. Similarly, cancer progression involves discrete transitions from normal to transformed states, with intermediate populations displaying plasticity and reversibility. Reprogramming studies have demonstrated that induced pluripotency involves stochastic fate decisions with variable kinetics, suggesting common underlying mechanisms. However, these observations remain fragmented across disciplines, with developmental biologists, cancer researchers, and stem cell biologists working largely independently despite studying fundamentally similar decision-making processes.

Mathematical frameworks from dynamical systems theory provide powerful tools for understanding cellular decisions as bifurcations in gene regulatory networks. Bistable switches, toggle switches, and saddle-node bifurcations have been proposed as mechanisms enabling discrete fate choices from continuous molecular changes. Theoretical work has identified network motifs such as mutual inhibition, positive feedback loops, and hierarchical regulatory cascades as architectural features enabling decision-making. However, systematic validation of these theoretical predictions across diverse biological contexts remains limited. Most studies focus on single systems or model organisms, preventing identification of conserved versus context-specific decision mechanisms.

Current limitations in understanding cellular decision-making stem from several factors. First, experimental studies typically examine individual fate choice contexts in isolation, precluding comparative analysis of decision mechanisms across development and disease. Second, single-cell datasets are analyzed using trajectory inference methods that identify developmental paths but rarely characterize the decision-making circuits controlling bifurcations. Third, integration of transcriptomic data with chromatin accessibility, lineage tracing, and protein dynamics remains technically challenging, limiting mechanistic insights. Fourth, mathematical models of cellular decisions are often developed independently of experimental data, reducing their predictive power. Finally, the field lacks standardized computational frameworks for identifying and characterizing bifurcation points in single-cell data.

This synthesis project addresses these limitations by integrating publicly available single-cell multi-omics datasets, lineage tracing studies, gene regulatory network databases, and mathematical modeling frameworks to decode cellular decision-making mechanisms. The project is timely because extensive single-cell atlases now exist for developmental systems, cancer progression, and cellular reprogramming, providing rich data resources for synthesis. Recent methodological advances in trajectory inference, RNA velocity analysis, and regulatory network reconstruction enable sophisticated analysis of decision dynamics. Furthermore, growing recognition that cancer plasticity and developmental decisions share common mechanisms creates opportunities for cross-disciplinary insights.

The significance of this work extends across multiple domains. In developmental biology, understanding decision mechanisms will reveal how robust lineage specification emerges from stochastic molecular processes. In cancer biology, characterizing decision circuits will identify vulnerabilities in tumor cell plasticity and therapeutic resistance. In regenerative medicine, predictive models of fate choice will enable rational design of reprogramming protocols. Methodologically, the project will establish computational frameworks for decision analysis applicable to any single-cell dataset. Theoretically, identifying conserved decision-making principles will advance fundamental understanding of how molecular networks generate discrete cellular behaviors. The synthesis approach is essential because no single laboratory possesses expertise spanning developmental biology, cancer biology, computational genomics, and mathematical modeling, nor access to the diverse datasets required for comprehensive analysis. This project will catalyze a transdisciplinary community focused on cellular decision-making, establishing new collaborative networks and training the next generation of data-savvy researchers capable of integrating experimental and theoretical approaches.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance understanding of cellular decision-making mechanisms.

Research Question 1: What gene regulatory network motifs enable binary fate decisions at cellular bifurcation points? We hypothesize that specific network architectures—including mutual inhibition circuits, positive feedback loops, and hierarchical regulatory cascades—are enriched at decision points across diverse biological contexts. We predict that (1) transcription factor pairs governing alternative fates will exhibit mutual antagonism with characteristic expression dynamics, (2) master regulators of each fate will show positive autoregulation creating bistable switches, and (3) upstream signaling pathways will converge on these core decision circuits through conserved regulatory logic. To test these hypotheses, we will reconstruct gene regulatory networks from integrated single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data across developmental, reprogramming, and cancer datasets. We will identify bifurcation points using trajectory inference and RNA velocity analysis, then characterize network topology specifically at these decision junctions. Comparative analysis across contexts will reveal conserved versus context-specific network motifs. We will validate predicted regulatory interactions against ChIP-seq databases and perturbation studies in the literature. Expected outcomes include a catalog of decision-making network motifs, quantitative metrics for motif prevalence across contexts, and identification of master regulators controlling fate bifurcations.

Research Question 2: How do cellular decision-making circuits achieve both robustness to noise and reversibility under appropriate conditions? We hypothesize that decision circuits employ distinct mechanisms for commitment versus plasticity, with commitment involving epigenetic reinforcement and metabolic rewiring, while reversibility requires maintaining accessibility of alternative fate programs. We predict that (1) committed cells will show progressive chromatin closing at alternative fate loci and opening at chosen fate loci, (2) metabolic shifts will stabilize fate decisions by altering the cellular state space, (3) cells retaining decision reversibility will maintain bivalent chromatin marks and low-level expression of alternative fate factors, and (4) external perturbations can destabilize committed states by disrupting epigenetic or metabolic reinforcement mechanisms. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and metabolomics data to characterize multi-omic changes during fate commitment. We will apply dynamical systems analysis to identify stable attractors and calculate basin stability for different fates. Comparison of reversible (reprogramming, cancer plasticity) versus irreversible (terminal differentiation) decisions will reveal mechanisms controlling plasticity. We will use published perturbation datasets to test whether predicted destabilization strategies enable fate reversal. Expected outcomes include mechanistic models of commitment and reversibility, identification of epigenetic and metabolic control points, and predictive frameworks for manipulating decision stability.

Research Question 3: Are cellular decision-making mechanisms conserved across developmental and disease contexts, or do different biological systems employ distinct strategies? We hypothesize that core decision-making principles are conserved, but implementation details vary based on developmental timing, tissue context, and evolutionary constraints. We predict that (1) the same network motifs will govern decisions across contexts but involve different specific genes, (2) decision kinetics will vary systematically with developmental stage and cell type, (3) cancer cells will co-opt developmental decision circuits but with altered regulatory parameters, and (4) evolutionary conservation of decision-making genes will correlate with their functional importance. To test these hypotheses, we will perform systematic comparative analysis of decision mechanisms across developmental systems (hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, mesoderm specification), reprogramming contexts (iPSC generation, transdifferentiation), and disease transitions (cancer initiation, metastasis, drug resistance). We will use orthology mapping to compare decision circuits across species. Machine learning approaches will identify shared versus context-specific features of decision-making. We will correlate evolutionary conservation with functional validation data from perturbation studies. Expected outcomes include a unified framework describing conserved decision-making principles, context-specific implementation rules, and evolutionary insights into decision circuit architecture.

Cross-cutting validation strategies will ensure robustness of findings. First, we will test whether decision circuits identified in one context can predict bifurcation points in independent datasets. Second, we will compare our network reconstructions with experimentally validated regulatory interactions from perturbation studies. Third, we will use mathematical models parameterized from one dataset to predict dynamics in other contexts. Fourth, we will assess whether identified decision markers are enriched in published gene sets associated with fate choice. Fifth, we will evaluate whether our predictive models can explain outcomes of published fate manipulation experiments. These validation approaches will establish confidence in synthesized insights and ensure findings reflect genuine biological principles rather than dataset-specific artifacts. The comprehensive hypothesis testing framework will generate mechanistic understanding of cellular decision-making with broad applicability across molecular and cellular biology.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse publicly available datasets and apply multidisciplinary analytical approaches to decode cellular decision-making mechanisms. The project is structured into four integrated work packages executed over three years.

Work Package 1: Data Integration and Harmonization (Months 1-9). We will compile and harmonize single-cell multi-omics datasets spanning developmental, reprogramming, and disease contexts. Data sources include: (1) Developmental atlases from the Human Cell Atlas, Mouse Cell Atlas, and Tabula Muris consortium, focusing on hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, cardiac development, and mesoderm specification; (2) Cancer progression datasets from the Human Tumor Atlas Network, including studies of breast cancer evolution, melanoma plasticity, and leukemia development; (3) Reprogramming time-courses from iPSC generation studies, transdifferentiation experiments, and direct conversion protocols; (4) Stem cell differentiation datasets covering ESC and iPSC differentiation into multiple lineages. We will access single-cell RNA-seq data from GEO, ArrayExpress, and the Single Cell Portal; ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE and Cistrome; lineage tracing data from published studies with available processed data; and gene regulatory network databases including RegNetwork, TRRUST, and ChEA. All datasets will be reprocessed using standardized pipelines (Seurat, Scanpy) to ensure comparability. Quality control will include filtering low-quality cells, doublet removal, and batch effect correction using Harmony and scVI. We will establish a centralized data repository with standardized metadata following FAIR principles. This work package will generate an integrated data resource comprising >50 datasets representing >5 million cells across >20 biological contexts.

Work Package 2: Identification and Characterization of Bifurcation Points (Months 6-18). We will apply trajectory inference and dynamical systems analysis to identify cellular decision points. Methods include: (1) Trajectory inference using multiple algorithms (Monocle 3, PAGA, Slingshot, CellRank) to map developmental paths and identify branch points; (2) RNA velocity analysis using scVelo and Velocyto to infer directional dynamics and validate trajectory topology; (3) Pseudotime ordering to establish temporal progression through decision processes; (4) Bifurcation analysis using dynamical systems approaches to identify saddle points and unstable equilibria in gene expression space; (5) Entropy and potency metrics to quantify decision commitment; (6) Transition probability analysis using Markov models to characterize decision dynamics. For each identified bifurcation point, we will extract cells in pre-decision, decision, and post-decision states. We will characterize molecular signatures of decision states through differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and transcription factor activity inference using SCENIC and DoRothEA. Comparison across contexts will identify conserved decision signatures. This work package will generate a comprehensive catalog of bifurcation points with associated molecular signatures across all analyzed contexts.

Work Package 3: Gene Regulatory Network Reconstruction and Motif Analysis (Months 12-24). We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks specifically at decision points and identify network motifs enabling fate choice. Approaches include: (1) Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to infer regulatory relationships using Pando, FigR, and Signac; (2) Network inference using multiple algorithms (GENIE3, GRNBoost2, SCENIC+) with ensemble approaches to improve accuracy; (3) Validation of predicted interactions against ChIP-seq databases and literature-curated networks; (4) Network motif detection using graph analysis tools to identify mutual inhibition, positive feedback, and feedforward loops; (5) Master regulator identification through network centrality analysis and perturbation response prediction; (6) Comparative network analysis across contexts using network alignment algorithms. We will apply mathematical modeling to test whether identified network architectures can generate bistable decision-making behavior. Ordinary differential equation models will be parameterized using expression dynamics from pseudotime analysis. Bifurcation analysis of these models will identify control parameters governing decision outcomes. Stochastic simulations will assess decision robustness to molecular noise. This work package will generate mechanistic models of decision-making circuits with validated regulatory logic.

Work Package 4: Predictive Modeling and Tool Development (Months 18-36). We will develop predictive models and computational tools for decision analysis. Deliverables include: (1) Machine learning models trained on multi-omic features to predict fate choice outcomes, using random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks; (2) Dynamical systems models that predict decision kinetics and responses to perturbations; (3) A computational toolkit (CellDecision) implementing standardized workflows for identifying bifurcation points, reconstructing decision circuits, and predicting fate outcomes from single-cell data; (4) A web-based Cellular Decision Atlas providing interactive visualization of decision mechanisms across contexts; (5) Benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics for testing decision prediction algorithms. Models will be validated using held-out datasets and cross-context prediction. We will test whether models trained on developmental data can predict cancer cell decisions and vice versa. Perturbation prediction accuracy will be assessed using published genetic and pharmacological manipulation studies.

Broader Impacts and Applications: Understanding cellular decision-making has profound implications for biomedicine. In regenerative medicine, predictive models will enable rational design of protocols for generating specific cell types from pluripotent stem cells or through direct conversion. Identifying decision circuit control parameters will suggest strategies for improving reprogramming efficiency and fidelity. In cancer therapy, characterizing decision mechanisms underlying tumor cell plasticity will reveal vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention. Targeting decision circuits may prevent acquisition of drug resistance or metastatic phenotypes. The framework will also inform understanding of developmental disorders arising from aberrant fate decisions. Beyond immediate applications, the synthesis approach will establish a paradigm for addressing complex biological questions through integration of diverse data types and disciplinary perspectives.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: Results will be disseminated through multiple channels ensuring broad accessibility. We will publish findings in high-impact journals spanning developmental biology (Development, Developmental Cell), cancer biology (Cancer Cell, Nature Cancer), computational biology (Nature Methods, Genome Biology), and general science (Nature, Science, Cell). We will target 8-10 publications including primary research articles, resource papers describing the atlas and toolkit, and perspective pieces synthesizing theoretical insights. All publications will be open access or deposited in preprint servers. Data, code, and analysis workflows will be deposited in appropriate repositories (GEO, GitHub, Zenodo) following FAIR principles. We will present findings at major conferences (ASCB, AACR, ISMB, Keystone Symposia) and organize symposia focused on cellular decision-making. The Cellular Decision Atlas and CellDecision toolkit will be actively maintained with user support and regular updates. We will engage with the community through webinars, social media, and direct outreach to potential users.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project will establish a lasting research community focused on cellular decision-making, with ongoing collaborations extending beyond the funding period. The computational infrastructure and data resources will be maintained through institutional support and future funding. The theoretical framework and methodological advances will guide future experimental and computational studies. We envision the Cellular Decision Atlas growing through community contributions, similar to successful resources like the Gene Ontology or ENCODE. The project will generate preliminary data and proof-of-concept results supporting future proposals for experimental validation and therapeutic development. Ultimately, this synthesis will transform understanding of how cells make fate decisions, revealing fundamental principles of biological information processing and enabling rational control of cellular behavior for medical applications.

By uniting evolutionary biologists, structural biologists, bioinformaticians, and functional genomicists, we will analyze domain distributions across the tree of life to infer ancient domain functions and trace their evolutionary trajectories. The project will synthesize data from protein structure and sequence databases, phylogenomic datasets, domain-domain interaction networks, and functional studies to address: What were the earliest protein domains and their functions?

The synthesis demands expertise in evolutionary biology, structural biology, and large-scale computational analysis. Deliverables include a protein domain evolutionary atlas, tools for domain phylogenetic analysis, curated databases of ancient domain functions, standardized workflows for domain archaeology, and training programs bridging evolution and molecular biology. This resource will reveal how protein functional diversity emerged and provide evolutionary context for understanding modern protein functions and engineering novel proteins.",,"Background And Significance

Protein domains represent the fundamental building blocks of molecular evolution, serving as discrete structural and functional units that have been shuffled, duplicated, and recombined throughout the history of life. Understanding how these domains emerged, diversified, and assembled into the complex proteins we observe today is central to comprehending cellular evolution and the origins of biological complexity. Despite decades of research in molecular evolution, we lack a comprehensive reconstruction of the ancient protein domain repertoire and the principles governing domain combination and functional innovation. This knowledge gap represents a critical limitation in our understanding of how cellular life evolved its remarkable functional diversity from a limited set of ancestral components.

The concept of protein domains as evolutionary modules was established through early structural studies and has been reinforced by comparative genomics. Current domain databases such as Pfam, InterPro, and SMART catalog thousands of domain families across millions of proteins, providing an unprecedented resource for evolutionary analysis. However, these databases primarily organize contemporary domain diversity without systematic reconstruction of ancestral states or evolutionary trajectories. Recent phylogenomic studies have begun to address the deep evolutionary history of proteins, with work by Caetano-Anollés and colleagues suggesting that certain protein folds date back to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Similarly, studies by Ranea and colleagues have explored domain combinations and their evolutionary patterns, while work from the Thornton laboratory has demonstrated the power of ancestral sequence reconstruction for understanding protein evolution. Yet these efforts remain fragmented, focusing on individual protein families or specific evolutionary questions without comprehensive synthesis across the entire protein universe.

Several key limitations constrain current understanding of protein domain evolution. First, existing phylogenetic analyses of domains often rely on limited taxonomic sampling or focus on model organisms, potentially missing crucial evolutionary transitions in understudied lineages. Second, the integration of structural information with phylogenetic data remains incomplete, despite the exponential growth of protein structures in the PDB and predicted structures from AlphaFold2. Third, functional annotation of domains relies heavily on experimental characterization in modern organisms, with limited inference of ancestral functions. Fourth, while domain combination patterns have been cataloged, the evolutionary and biophysical constraints governing which domains can successfully combine remain poorly understood. Finally, the temporal ordering of domain emergence and the correlation between domain age and cellular functions has not been systematically established across all domains of life.

This synthesis project is timely for several compelling reasons. The maturation of multiple large-scale data resources—including comprehensive domain databases, complete genomes from across the tree of life, structural databases expanded by both experimental and computational methods, and functional genomics datasets—now enables integrated analysis at unprecedented scale. Recent methodological advances in phylogenetic inference, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and network analysis provide the analytical toolkit necessary for domain archaeology. Furthermore, the growing recognition that evolutionary context is essential for understanding protein function and for rational protein engineering creates practical demand for this knowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how evolutionary analysis of protein domains can inform understanding of viral proteins and host-pathogen interactions, demonstrating the applied relevance of fundamental evolutionary research.

The significance of this work extends across multiple dimensions. Scientifically, reconstructing the molecular fossil record will reveal fundamental principles of biological innovation, showing how limited ancestral components generated vast functional diversity through recombination and divergence. This addresses longstanding questions about the origins of cellular complexity and the evolutionary mechanisms underlying protein functional innovation. Methodologically, the project will develop new approaches for integrating heterogeneous data types and for inferring ancestral states from contemporary distributions, advancing the field of molecular evolution. Practically, understanding domain compatibility rules and ancestral functions will inform protein engineering efforts, potentially enabling design of novel proteins with desired functions. Educationally, this project will train a new generation of researchers capable of integrating evolutionary, structural, and functional perspectives on proteins. The comprehensive resources generated will serve the broader scientific community, providing evolutionary context for interpreting experimental results and guiding future research directions. This synthesis project exemplifies the power of community-scale data integration to address questions beyond the scope of individual laboratories, requiring diverse expertise and computational resources to unite disparate data sources into coherent evolutionary narratives.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project is organized around three primary research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our understanding of protein domain evolution and cellular functional diversification.

Research Question 1: What were the earliest protein domains, when did they emerge, and what functions did they perform in ancient cells? This question addresses the fundamental composition of the ancestral protein toolkit and its relationship to early cellular metabolism and information processing. We hypothesize that the most ancient domains will be enriched for functions essential to core cellular processes—specifically nucleotide binding and metabolism, RNA binding, and basic catalytic functions required for central metabolism. We predict that domains with the broadest phylogenetic distribution, particularly those found across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), will represent the ancestral repertoire present in LUCA. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ancient domains will exhibit greater structural simplicity and thermostability compared to more recently evolved domains, reflecting the environmental conditions of early life. To test these hypotheses, we will perform comprehensive phylogenetic profiling of all domain families across representative genomes spanning the tree of life, identifying domains with universal or near-universal distribution. We will apply molecular clock methods calibrated with established phylogenetic markers to estimate domain emergence times. We will analyze the structural properties of ancient versus recent domains using metrics including fold complexity, secondary structure composition, and predicted thermostability. Expected outcomes include a ranked catalog of domain families by evolutionary age, functional enrichment analysis revealing the biochemical capabilities of ancient cells, and structural characterization of the ancestral domain repertoire. This will provide unprecedented insight into the molecular composition of early life and the evolutionary trajectory from simple to complex cellular functions.

Research Question 2: How did domain recombination generate functional innovation, and what patterns characterize the evolution of multi-domain proteins? This question examines the mechanisms by which domain shuffling and combination created new protein functions throughout evolutionary history. We hypothesize that domain recombination follows non-random patterns, with certain domain pairs showing strong preferences for co-occurrence due to functional synergy or structural compatibility. We predict that the complexity of domain architectures (number of domains per protein) increased over evolutionary time, with prokaryotes having simpler architectures than eukaryotes, reflecting increasing regulatory and functional sophistication. We further hypothesize that specific domain combinations are associated with major evolutionary innovations, such as the emergence of multicellularity, development of adaptive immunity, or evolution of complex signaling networks. Additionally, we predict that successful domain combinations will show evidence of co-evolution at domain interfaces, with compensatory mutations maintaining structural integrity and functional coupling. To test these hypotheses, we will construct comprehensive domain co-occurrence networks across all sequenced genomes, identifying statistically significant domain partnerships and their phylogenetic distributions. We will perform comparative analysis of domain architecture complexity across major taxonomic groups and correlate architectural innovations with known evolutionary transitions. We will apply network community detection algorithms to identify modules of frequently co-occurring domains and analyze their functional coherence. We will examine domain-domain interfaces in multi-domain proteins using structural data to identify sequence signatures of co-evolution. Expected outcomes include a domain combination atlas mapping preferred and forbidden domain partnerships, identification of domain combinations associated with major evolutionary innovations, and elucidation of sequence and structural features enabling successful domain fusion. This will reveal the grammar of domain combination and the evolutionary mechanisms generating protein functional diversity.

Research Question 3: What biophysical and evolutionary constraints govern domain compatibility and limit possible domain combinations? This question addresses why certain domain combinations are common while others are never observed, despite theoretical possibility. We hypothesize that domain compatibility is constrained by multiple factors including structural compatibility (domains must fold independently without interference), functional coherence (combined domains should contribute to related cellular processes), expression compatibility (domains must function under similar cellular conditions), and evolutionary accessibility (domain combinations require feasible mutational paths). We predict that incompatible domain pairs will show evidence of structural clashes when modeled together, conflicting functional requirements (e.g., nuclear versus mitochondrial localization), or absence of intermediate evolutionary states that could facilitate their combination. We further hypothesize that domain boundaries and linker regions play critical roles in enabling successful combinations, with flexible linkers allowing independent domain folding and function. To test these hypotheses, we will systematically analyze observed versus theoretically possible domain combinations, identifying underrepresented or absent pairs. We will use structural modeling to predict compatibility of domain pairs, examining potential steric clashes and folding interference. We will analyze functional annotations of domain pairs to assess functional coherence and identify conflicting requirements. We will examine linker sequences connecting domains in multi-domain proteins to identify sequence features associated with successful combinations. We will perform evolutionary simulations to assess the accessibility of different domain combinations through realistic mutational processes. Expected outcomes include a predictive framework for domain compatibility, identification of specific constraints limiting domain combinations, and design principles for engineering novel multi-domain proteins. This will provide both fundamental understanding of evolutionary constraints and practical guidance for synthetic biology applications. Collectively, these three research questions and their associated hypotheses will comprehensively address the evolutionary history of protein domains, the mechanisms of functional innovation through domain recombination, and the principles governing protein evolution, providing transformative insights into the molecular basis of cellular life.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate multiple large-scale public datasets and apply diverse analytical methods through a coordinated, phased approach over a three-year timeline. The project is organized into four integrated work packages, each led by team members with relevant expertise, with regular cross-work package meetings ensuring synthesis and integration.

Data Sources and Integration (Months 1-6): We will compile and harmonize data from multiple public repositories. Primary domain data will be obtained from Pfam (release 35.0, containing ~20,000 domain families), InterPro (integrating multiple domain databases), SMART (focusing on signaling domains), and NCBI's Conserved Domain Database. Protein sequence data will be obtained from UniProt (complete proteomes for ~1,000 representative species spanning all domains of life, selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage while minimizing redundancy) and RefSeq. Structural data will be compiled from the Protein Data Bank (PDB, ~200,000 experimental structures) and AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (~200 million predicted structures). Phylogenetic data will be obtained from established resources including GTDB (Genome Taxonomy Database), TimeTree (for divergence time estimates), and published phylogenomic studies. Functional annotation data will be integrated from Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, Reactome, and literature-curated databases. Domain-domain interaction data will be compiled from 3did, DOMINE, and experimental protein interaction databases. We will develop a unified data warehouse with standardized identifiers and cross-references, implementing quality control procedures to identify and resolve inconsistencies. All data integration workflows will be documented and made publicly available through GitHub repositories.

Work Package 1: Domain Phylogenetic Profiling and Age Estimation (Months 4-18): We will perform comprehensive phylogenetic profiling by mapping all Pfam domains to the selected representative proteomes, creating a presence-absence matrix of domains across species. For each domain family, we will construct phylogenetic trees using representative sequences from diverse taxa, employing maximum likelihood methods (IQ-TREE) with appropriate substitution models selected via ModelFinder. We will implement ancestral state reconstruction to infer domain presence at internal nodes of the species tree, identifying domains present in LUCA and subsequent evolutionary innovations. Domain age will be estimated using multiple complementary approaches: phylogenetic distribution patterns (domains present in all three domains of life are ancient), molecular clock analysis calibrated with established divergence times, and correlation with known evolutionary events. We will validate age estimates through consistency checks across methods and comparison with previous studies of specific protein families. For ancient domains, we will perform ancestral sequence reconstruction using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches, generating predicted sequences of ancestral domains. These ancestral sequences will be analyzed for structural properties using secondary structure prediction, disorder prediction, and thermostability estimation tools. Functional predictions for ancestral domains will be made by integrating phylogenetic distribution with functional annotations of modern descendants, identifying conserved functions versus lineage-specific innovations.

Work Package 2: Domain Combination Analysis and Network Modeling (Months 7-24): We will systematically catalog domain architectures (ordered arrangements of domains within proteins) across all analyzed proteomes, creating a comprehensive database of observed domain combinations. For each domain pair, we will calculate co-occurrence frequencies and statistical significance using hypergeometric tests corrected for multiple testing. We will construct domain co-occurrence networks where nodes represent domains and edges represent significant co-occurrence, with edge weights reflecting co-occurrence strength. Network analysis will employ community detection algorithms (Louvain method, Infomap) to identify modules of frequently co-occurring domains, and we will assess functional coherence of modules using GO enrichment analysis. We will map domain combinations onto the species phylogeny to infer when specific combinations emerged, identifying domain partnerships associated with major evolutionary transitions (e.g., prokaryote-eukaryote transition, emergence of metazoans). We will analyze domain architecture complexity metrics (number of domains per protein, architectural diversity) across taxonomic groups and correlate with organismal complexity measures. For multi-domain proteins with available structures, we will analyze domain-domain interfaces using structural bioinformatics tools, extracting interface residues and calculating interface properties (surface area, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts). We will perform co-evolution analysis on domain pairs using methods such as Direct Coupling Analysis to identify residue pairs showing correlated evolution across domain interfaces, indicating functional or structural coupling.

Work Package 3: Domain Compatibility Analysis and Constraint Identification (Months 13-30): We will systematically enumerate theoretically possible domain pairs and compare with observed combinations to identify underrepresented or absent pairs. For absent or rare domain pairs, we will test multiple constraint hypotheses. Structural compatibility will be assessed by modeling domain pairs using AlphaFold2-multimer and analyzing predicted structures for steric clashes, folding interference, or unstable configurations. Functional compatibility will be evaluated by comparing GO annotations, subcellular localization predictions, and pathway associations of domain pairs, identifying conflicting requirements. We will analyze linker sequences connecting domains in multi-domain proteins, characterizing length distributions, amino acid composition, secondary structure propensity, and flexibility. Machine learning models (random forests, gradient boosting) will be trained to predict domain pair compatibility based on features including structural properties, functional annotations, phylogenetic distributions, and linker characteristics. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and independent test sets. We will perform evolutionary simulations using established frameworks to assess the mutational accessibility of different domain combinations, testing whether absent combinations are evolutionarily unreachable or selectively disadvantageous.

Work Package 4: Resource Development and Validation (Months 18-36): We will develop a comprehensive Protein Domain Evolutionary Atlas as an interactive web resource, providing visualizations of domain phylogenetic distributions, age estimates, combination patterns, and functional annotations. The atlas will include search and browse functions, downloadable datasets, and API access for programmatic queries. We will implement phylogenetic analysis tools specifically designed for domain-level analysis, including automated pipelines for domain age estimation and ancestral sequence reconstruction. All analytical workflows will be packaged as documented, reproducible pipelines using workflow management systems (Snakemake or Nextflow) and containerized using Docker for portability. We will validate key findings through multiple approaches: comparison with experimental data from literature, consistency checks across independent datasets, and collaboration with experimental groups for targeted validation of specific predictions. Case studies will be developed for specific protein families or domain combinations, providing detailed evolutionary reconstructions that integrate all data types and analytical approaches.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 milestones include completion of data integration infrastructure (Month 6), initial domain phylogenetic profiling results (Month 12), and preliminary domain age estimates (Month 12). Year 2 milestones include completion of domain combination network analysis (Month 18), identification of ancient domain repertoire (Month 18), and initial domain compatibility models (Month 24). Year 3 milestones include completion of constraint analysis (Month 30), validation of key findings (Month 33), and launch of public resources and tools (Month 36). The project will employ agile methodology with quarterly team meetings, monthly work package meetings, and continuous integration of results across work packages. All team members will have access to shared computational resources and collaborative platforms for code sharing, data management, and manuscript preparation.

This molecular fossil record will reveal which biochemical functions were available to ancient cells and how functional capabilities expanded over time. We will generate a domain combination atlas documenting the evolutionary history of multi-domain protein architectures, identifying when and in which lineages specific domain partnerships emerged. This atlas will reveal the evolutionary mechanisms underlying major biological innovations, such as the emergence of complex signaling networks in eukaryotes or the evolution of adaptive immunity in vertebrates. The project will establish quantitative principles governing domain compatibility, providing a predictive framework for understanding which domain combinations are possible and which are prohibited by structural, functional, or evolutionary constraints. These principles will advance fundamental understanding of protein evolution and the limits of biological innovation. We will produce validated ancestral domain sequences for ancient protein families, enabling experimental resurrection of ancestral proteins to test functional predictions and understand how protein properties have changed over evolutionary time. The integration of structural data with evolutionary analysis will reveal how domain structures have been conserved or modified across evolutionary timescales, identifying structural features essential for domain function versus those that are evolutionarily plastic.

Methodological Advances: The project will develop novel computational methods for domain-level phylogenetic analysis, including improved algorithms for domain age estimation that account for horizontal gene transfer, gene loss, and phylogenetic uncertainty. These methods will be applicable beyond protein domains to other evolutionary questions involving modular biological components. We will create standardized workflows for integrating sequence, structure, phylogenetic, and functional data, providing templates for future synthesis projects in molecular evolution. The machine learning models for predicting domain compatibility will represent new tools for computational protein design and synthetic biology. All methods will be thoroughly documented, validated, and released as open-source software with comprehensive tutorials, ensuring accessibility to researchers with varying computational expertise. The data integration infrastructure developed for this project will serve as a model for harmonizing heterogeneous biological databases, addressing a persistent challenge in computational biology.

Community Resources: The Protein Domain Evolutionary Atlas will serve as a central resource for researchers studying protein evolution, function, or engineering. The atlas will provide evolutionary context for interpreting experimental results, helping researchers understand whether observed protein properties reflect ancient conserved features or recent adaptations. The curated database of ancient domain functions will enable researchers to formulate evolutionary hypotheses about protein functions and guide experimental design. The domain combination database will inform protein engineering efforts by identifying successful domain partnerships and avoiding incompatible combinations. All datasets will be released in standard formats with comprehensive metadata, ensuring interoperability with existing bioinformatics tools and databases. We will deposit data in established repositories (Zenodo, Dryad) and submit domain annotations to InterPro for integration into community databases. Regular data releases throughout the project will ensure timely availability of results to the community.

Broader Impacts: Understanding protein domain evolution has implications extending beyond basic science. In biotechnology, knowledge of domain compatibility principles will inform rational design of novel proteins with desired functions, potentially accelerating development of biosensors, therapeutic proteins, or industrial enzymes. In medicine, evolutionary analysis of protein domains can reveal functional constraints and predict consequences of genetic variants, informing precision medicine approaches. The evolutionary context provided by this project will enhance interpretation of genomic data in clinical settings, helping distinguish pathogenic variants from benign polymorphisms. In synthetic biology, the principles of domain combination will guide construction of artificial proteins and genetic circuits. The project will contribute to understanding of how biological complexity emerges from simpler components, addressing fundamental questions relevant to origins of life research and astrobiology.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will provide comprehensive training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, developing expertise at the intersection of evolutionary biology, structural biology, and computational science. Trainees will gain experience with large-scale data integration, phylogenetic analysis, structural bioinformatics, and machine learning—skills increasingly essential in modern biological research. We will develop and disseminate training materials including online tutorials, workshop curricula, and documented case studies that can be used in graduate courses on molecular evolution or computational biology. Annual workshops will bring together trainees from participating institutions for intensive training in domain archaeology methods, fostering a community of practice in this emerging field. We will prioritize recruitment of trainees from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research infrastructure, promoting diversity in computational biology.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: Results will be disseminated through multiple channels to reach diverse audiences. We will publish high-impact papers in journals spanning evolutionary biology (Molecular Biology and Evolution, Genome Biology and Evolution), structural biology (Structure, Protein Science), and general science (Nature Communications, PNAS). We will prepare separate papers on: (1) the ancient domain repertoire and early protein evolution, (2) domain combination patterns and evolutionary innovations, (3) domain compatibility principles and constraints, (4) methodological advances in domain phylogenetics, and (5) the Protein Domain Evolutionary Atlas resource. All papers will be published in open-access journals or made available through preprint servers (bioRxiv) to ensure broad accessibility. We will present results at major conferences including ISMB, SMBE, and Biophysical Society meetings, and organize symposia bringing together evolutionary and structural biologists. We will engage with the broader public through institutional press releases, blog posts, and social media, explaining how evolutionary analysis reveals the history of life at the molecular level.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: Beyond the initial three-year project, we envision this work catalyzing ongoing community efforts in protein domain archaeology. The resources and methods developed will enable future researchers to extend analysis to newly sequenced genomes, incorporate emerging structural data, and refine evolutionary reconstructions as methods improve. We will establish a community advisory board to guide future development of the Domain Evolutionary Atlas, ensuring it remains responsive to user needs. We will seek additional funding to maintain and expand the atlas, potentially through database maintenance grants or integration with established resources like InterPro or UniProt. The project will establish a network of researchers spanning evolutionary biology, structural biology, and bioinformatics, fostering ongoing collaborations that extend beyond this initial synthesis effort. Ultimately, this project will establish protein domain archaeology as a recognized subdiscipline, providing evolutionary context for understanding the molecular basis of cellular life and inspiring future generations of researchers to explore the deep history of biological molecules.

This synthesis project will integrate epigenomic data (DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility), stress-response transcriptomics, metabolomic profiles, and protein modification datasets from organisms exposed to diverse stressors (heat shock, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation, hypoxia) to decode how cells encode and retrieve stress memories. By uniting epigeneticists, stress biologists, biochemists, and information theorists, we will analyze temporal patterns of molecular changes to identify memory-encoding mechanisms that persist after stress removal. The project will synthesize data from GEO, ENCODE, MetaboLights, and stress-response databases across yeast, plants, and mammalian systems to address: How long do different molecular memories persist? What determines memory stability versus erasure? How do cells integrate multiple stress histories? We will develop information-theoretic frameworks to quantify memory capacity in molecular networks, apply time-lagged correlation analyses to identify causal memory mechanisms, and use comparative approaches to distinguish conserved versus lineage-specific memory systems. This work addresses fundamental questions about cellular learning and adaptation that require integration of epigenomics, metabolomics, and stress biology data across multiple timescales and organisms—capabilities beyond individual laboratories. Deliverables include a stress memory atlas mapping molecular imprints across stressor types and durations, predictive models for memory formation and decay, open-source tools for temporal multi-omics integration, and training modules in quantitative stress biology. This resource will reveal how cells encode environmental history and inform strategies for priming stress resistance in agriculture and medicine.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular stress memory represents a fundamental yet poorly understood phenomenon where prior exposure to environmental challenges alters subsequent cellular responses, often conferring adaptive advantages. This phenomenon has been documented across all domains of life, from bacterial persistence to mammalian immune training, yet our understanding remains fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. The molecular mechanisms that encode, maintain, and retrieve these memories operate across multiple timescales—from minutes to generations—and involve complex interactions between epigenetic modifications, metabolic reprogramming, and protein homeostasis networks. Despite decades of research on individual stress responses, we lack a unified framework for understanding how cells integrate environmental history into their molecular architecture.

Recent advances have revealed that stress memory is not merely a passive consequence of incomplete recovery but an active cellular strategy. In yeast, heat shock priming enhances thermotolerance for hours through maintained expression of heat shock proteins and altered chromatin states at stress-responsive genes. In plants, drought priming can persist through mitotic divisions via histone modifications and small RNA pathways, enabling faster stomatal closure upon subsequent water limitation. Mammalian cells exhibit trained immunity, where innate immune cells exposed to pathogens or metabolic signals show enhanced responses weeks later through epigenetic reprogramming at inflammatory gene loci. These observations suggest conserved principles of cellular memory that transcend specific stressors and organisms.

However, current research faces critical limitations. First, studies typically focus on single stressor types within single model systems, preventing identification of universal versus context-specific memory mechanisms. Second, most investigations examine limited molecular layers—either transcriptomics or epigenomics—missing the multi-layered nature of memory encoding. Third, temporal resolution is often inadequate to distinguish immediate stress responses from persistent memory states. Fourth, the field lacks quantitative frameworks to measure memory capacity, fidelity, and decay kinetics across molecular networks. Finally, we cannot predict which stresses will generate lasting memories versus transient responses, limiting our ability to harness stress memory for practical applications.

The significance of understanding cellular stress memory extends far beyond basic biology. In agriculture, stress priming could enhance crop resilience to climate variability without genetic modification. In medicine, understanding trained immunity mechanisms could improve vaccine efficacy and cancer immunotherapy. In biotechnology, engineered stress memory could optimize microbial production strains. Conversely, maladaptive stress memories contribute to aging, metabolic disease, and transgenerational trauma effects. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how viral stress can trigger long-lasting immune and metabolic changes, underscoring the clinical relevance of stress memory mechanisms.

This proposal addresses these gaps through comprehensive synthesis of existing multi-omics datasets across diverse stressors and organisms. The explosive growth of publicly available epigenomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data from stress experiments creates an unprecedented opportunity for synthesis research. Databases like GEO contain thousands of stress-response time-series experiments, ENCODE provides extensive chromatin state maps, MetaboLights archives metabolomic profiles, and specialized repositories document stress responses across model systems. However, these data remain siloed within individual studies and disciplines, preventing the integrative analyses needed to decode stress memory mechanisms.

The timing is optimal for this synthesis project. Computational tools for multi-omics integration have matured, information theory provides rigorous frameworks for quantifying biological memory, and machine learning enables pattern discovery in high-dimensional temporal data. Moreover, the research community increasingly recognizes that fundamental questions about cellular adaptation require transdisciplinary collaboration and data integration beyond single-lab capabilities. This project will catalyze a new field of molecular archaeology—reconstructing cellular environmental history from molecular imprints—with transformative implications for understanding how cells learn from experience. By uniting epigeneticists, stress biologists, metabolic biochemists, and computational theorists, we will develop the conceptual frameworks, analytical tools, and empirical resources needed to decode the molecular basis of cellular memory across biological scales.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our fundamental understanding of cellular stress memory.

Research Question 1: What are the temporal dynamics and molecular substrates of stress memory across different stressor types and biological systems? We hypothesize that stress memories exhibit characteristic decay kinetics that depend on the molecular layer encoding them, with epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone modifications) persisting longer than transcriptional changes, which in turn outlast metabolic alterations. We predict that chromatin accessibility changes will show intermediate persistence, serving as a bridge between stable epigenetic marks and dynamic transcriptional responses. To test this, we will extract time-series data from stress-recovery experiments across yeast, Arabidopsis, C. elegans, Drosophila, and mammalian cell systems, quantifying the half-life of molecular changes at each layer after stress removal. We expect to identify three temporal classes of memory: short-term (minutes to hours, primarily metabolic), medium-term (hours to days, transcriptional and chromatin-based), and long-term (days to transgenerational, epigenetic). We will validate these predictions by comparing decay kinetics across independent datasets and testing whether molecular layer predicts memory duration better than stressor type or organism.

Research Question 2: How do cells encode and integrate memories of multiple sequential or simultaneous stresses? We hypothesize that stress memory systems exhibit both interference (where conflicting stresses erase each other's memories) and synergy (where related stresses reinforce shared molecular changes), following principles analogous to associative learning in neural systems. We predict that stresses activating overlapping transcriptional programs (e.g., heat shock and oxidative stress, both inducing protein damage responses) will show synergistic memory integration, while stresses with antagonistic signaling pathways (e.g., nutrient excess versus limitation) will show interference. To test this, we will analyze datasets where cells experienced sequential stress exposures, using network analysis to identify shared versus distinct molecular responses. We will develop information-theoretic measures of memory capacity—quantifying how many distinct stress histories can be simultaneously encoded in molecular networks—and apply these to multi-stress datasets. We expect to find that memory capacity scales with network complexity, with mammalian cells encoding more distinct memories than yeast due to larger epigenomic and metabolic networks. We will validate predictions by comparing observed multi-stress responses to computational models trained on single-stress data.

Research Question 3: What molecular features distinguish conserved, evolutionarily ancient stress memory mechanisms from lineage-specific adaptations? We hypothesize that core stress memory mechanisms involving heat shock proteins, oxidative stress responses, and metabolic checkpoints are deeply conserved across eukaryotes, while specific epigenetic readers/writers and chromatin remodeling complexes show lineage-specific elaboration. We predict that conserved memory mechanisms will involve post-translational modifications and metabolite-mediated signaling, while lineage-specific mechanisms will rely more heavily on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. To test this, we will perform comparative analyses across yeast, plant, invertebrate, and mammalian stress datasets, identifying orthologous genes and pathways showing memory responses. We will use phylogenetic profiling to correlate the presence of specific epigenetic machinery with memory duration and complexity. We expect to find that organisms with more complex epigenetic systems (mammals > plants > yeast) exhibit longer-lasting and more diverse stress memories, while core metabolic memory mechanisms show similar kinetics across taxa.

Cross-cutting hypothesis: We propose that stress memory operates through a hierarchical encoding system where rapid, reversible changes (metabolic, post-translational) gate access to slower, more stable changes (chromatin, epigenetic), creating a molecular filter that converts transient stresses into lasting memories only when threshold criteria are met. This predicts that memory formation requires stress duration and/or intensity above specific thresholds, which we will quantify by analyzing dose-response and duration-response relationships in existing datasets.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A quantitative atlas mapping memory duration for specific molecular marks across stressor types and organisms; (2) Predictive models that forecast memory formation and decay from stress parameters; (3) Identification of master regulators that control memory encoding versus erasure decisions; (4) Network motifs that enable memory integration versus interference; (5) Evolutionary trajectories showing how stress memory systems have elaborated across lineages. These outcomes will be validated through cross-dataset predictions, where models trained on one organism or stressor type successfully predict memory dynamics in independent datasets. Success will be measured by prediction accuracy exceeding 70% for memory duration and 60% for multi-stress integration patterns, benchmarks established from preliminary analyses of existing data.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates four complementary methodological strategies: comprehensive data aggregation and harmonization, multi-layer temporal analysis, information-theoretic modeling, and comparative evolutionary analysis. The project will unfold over three years with specific milestones and deliverables.

Data Sources and Aggregation (Months 1-6): We will systematically identify and curate datasets from multiple public repositories. From Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we will extract time-series transcriptomic data (RNA-seq and microarray) from stress-recovery experiments, targeting at least 200 datasets across heat shock, oxidative stress (H2O2, paraquat), nutrient limitation (glucose, nitrogen, amino acid starvation), hypoxia, osmotic stress, and DNA damage in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Arabidopsis, C. elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and human cells. From ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics, we will obtain chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq), histone modification ChIP-seq (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3), and DNA methylation data from stress experiments. MetaboLights and Metabolomics Workbench will provide metabolomic profiles from stressed cells. ProteomeXchange and PRIDE will supply proteomics and post-translational modification data. We will develop standardized metadata schemas capturing stress type, intensity, duration, recovery time, organism, cell type, and experimental conditions. Data harmonization will involve mapping to common gene/protein identifiers, normalizing expression values using quantile normalization or batch correction (ComBat-seq), and aligning temporal measurements to standardized time scales.

Multi-Layer Temporal Analysis (Months 4-18): We will apply time-lagged correlation analysis to identify causal relationships between molecular layers, testing whether epigenetic changes precede transcriptional changes, which precede metabolic changes, or vice versa. Dynamic time warping will align temporal profiles across experiments with different sampling frequencies. We will fit exponential decay models to quantify memory half-lives for each molecular feature, using mixed-effects models to account for dataset-specific variation while estimating general decay parameters. Change-point detection algorithms will identify transitions from acute stress response to memory state to full recovery. For multi-stress integration analysis, we will develop tensor decomposition methods to identify shared versus stress-specific molecular signatures across three-way data structures (genes × time × stress conditions). Network analysis using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Bayesian network inference will identify hub regulators coordinating memory responses across molecular layers.

Information-Theoretic Modeling (Months 12-24): We will quantify memory capacity using mutual information between past stress exposure and current molecular state, calculating I(Stress_history; Molecular_state|Time_since_stress) to measure how much information about past stress persists at different recovery times. Transfer entropy will assess directed information flow between molecular layers, identifying which layers drive memory encoding versus responding to upstream changes. We will develop Hidden Markov Models where hidden states represent memory versus non-memory cellular states, with emission probabilities determined by molecular profiles, allowing us to classify cells as memory-bearing or memory-free based on multi-omics signatures. Maximum entropy models will identify minimal sets of molecular features sufficient to predict memory state, revealing the most information-rich memory markers. We will implement these analyses in Python using custom scripts built on scikit-learn, PyTorch, and specialized information theory libraries.

Comparative Evolutionary Analysis (Months 18-30): Ortholog mapping using OrthoFinder will identify conserved stress-responsive genes across species. We will perform phylogenetic profiling to correlate the presence/absence of epigenetic machinery (DNA methyltransferases, histone modifiers, chromatin remodelers) with memory duration and complexity metrics. Ancestral state reconstruction will infer the evolutionary history of stress memory mechanisms. We will test whether memory capacity scales with genome size, epigenetic complexity, or organismal complexity using phylogenetic comparative methods that account for shared evolutionary history.

Computational Infrastructure: All analyses will be conducted on high-performance computing clusters with version-controlled code repositories (GitHub) and containerized workflows (Docker, Nextflow) ensuring reproducibility. We will establish a project data portal providing interactive visualization of stress memory dynamics across conditions and organisms.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1 - Complete data aggregation and harmonization; establish computational infrastructure; conduct preliminary temporal analyses on pilot datasets; deliver initial stress memory atlas prototype. Year 2 - Complete multi-layer temporal analyses; develop and validate information-theoretic models; perform comparative evolutionary analyses; publish first manuscripts on memory duration and molecular substrates. Year 3 - Complete multi-stress integration analyses; finalize predictive models; develop open-source software tools; create training modules; publish comprehensive stress memory atlas and synthesis manuscripts.

Validation Strategy: We will use cross-validation approaches where models trained on subsets of data predict held-out datasets. We will test predictions against newly published datasets not available during initial analysis. We will compare our synthesis-derived predictions to targeted experimental validations from collaborating laboratories (though no new data generation is funded by this project).

Team Expertise and Collaboration: Our working group brings together epigeneticists specializing in chromatin dynamics, stress biologists with expertise in heat shock and oxidative stress responses, metabolic biochemists studying metabolic memory, computational biologists skilled in multi-omics integration, and information theorists who can formalize memory concepts mathematically. The team spans five institutions across three countries, includes three early-career investigators, and commits to monthly virtual meetings plus two annual in-person synthesis workshops.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications of cellular stress memory, with impacts spanning molecular biology, evolutionary biology, agriculture, and medicine.

Primary Deliverables: (1) The Cellular Stress Memory Atlas—a comprehensive, interactive database mapping molecular imprints of diverse stresses across organisms and timescales. This atlas will document memory duration, molecular substrates, and decay kinetics for hundreds of stress conditions, providing the field's first systematic catalog of cellular memory phenomena. The atlas will be publicly accessible through a web portal with visualization tools allowing researchers to query specific stresses, organisms, or molecular layers, and download underlying data and analysis code. (2) Predictive computational models that forecast memory formation, duration, and decay from stress parameters and initial molecular responses. These models will enable researchers to predict whether a given stress will generate lasting memory and identify the molecular layers most likely to encode that memory. (3) Open-source software tools for temporal multi-omics integration, including R and Python packages implementing our time-lagged correlation methods, information-theoretic memory quantification, and multi-stress integration analyses. These tools will be deposited in CRAN, PyPI, and Bioconductor with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. (4) A theoretical framework formalizing cellular memory using information theory, providing rigorous mathematical definitions of memory capacity, fidelity, and decay that can be applied across biological systems.

Scientific Impact: This work will resolve long-standing questions about how cells encode environmental history, establishing stress memory as a quantifiable, predictable phenomenon rather than an anecdotal observation. By identifying conserved memory mechanisms, we will reveal fundamental principles of cellular adaptation that operate across life's diversity. The comparative evolutionary analysis will illuminate how stress memory systems have elaborated during eukaryotic evolution, potentially explaining why organisms with complex epigenetic machinery inhabit more variable environments. Our multi-stress integration analysis will establish principles of memory interference and synergy, analogous to associative learning rules in neuroscience, potentially revealing deep connections between cellular and neural memory. The information-theoretic framework will enable quantitative comparisons of memory capacity across biological scales, from molecular networks to cells to organisms, unifying disparate memory phenomena under common theoretical principles.

Broader Applications: In agriculture, our stress memory atlas will guide development of priming protocols that enhance crop stress tolerance. By identifying which priming treatments generate lasting protective memories, we can optimize timing and intensity of hardening treatments. The predictive models will enable precision agriculture approaches where priming is tailored to forecasted environmental conditions. In medicine, understanding trained immunity mechanisms will inform vaccine adjuvant design and immunotherapy protocols. Our identification of memory erasure mechanisms could suggest interventions for maladaptive stress memories contributing to metabolic disease or aging. In biotechnology, engineered stress memory could improve industrial microbe performance under fluctuating fermentation conditions. The project will also inform conservation biology by predicting how organisms might adapt to climate change through stress memory versus requiring genetic evolution.

Training and Workforce Development: We will train 6-8 graduate students and postdocs through direct involvement in working group activities, providing cross-disciplinary mentorship in epigenomics, stress biology, and computational analysis. We will develop three training modules: (1) Temporal Multi-Omics Analysis, teaching time-series experimental design and analysis; (2) Information Theory for Biologists, introducing information-theoretic concepts and applications; (3) Stress Memory Mechanisms, synthesizing current knowledge. These modules will be offered as intensive short courses at annual meetings and made freely available online with video lectures and hands-on exercises using our curated datasets. We will prioritize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and primarily undergraduate institutions.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: We will publish 8-10 manuscripts in high-impact journals spanning molecular biology (Cell, Nature Cell Biology, Molecular Cell), systems biology (Cell Systems, Molecular Systems Biology), and specialized journals (Nucleic Acids Research for epigenomics, Plant Cell for plant stress memory). We will target one synthesis paper in Science or Nature reviewing cellular memory across biological scales. All manuscripts will be deposited as preprints in bioRxiv upon submission. We will present findings at annual meetings of relevant societies (American Society for Cell Biology, Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, Genetics Society of America) and organize a symposium on cellular stress memory. We will engage broader audiences through press releases, blog posts, and social media highlighting key discoveries.

Long-term Sustainability: The Stress Memory Atlas will be maintained for at least five years post-project through institutional support and integration with existing databases like GEO and ENCODE. The open-source software tools will be maintained through community contributions coordinated via GitHub. We will establish a Stress Memory Research Network connecting working group members with the broader community, facilitating future collaborations and data sharing. This project will catalyze a new research field with sustained momentum beyond the funding period, as evidenced by follow-up proposals already planned to experimentally test synthesis-derived predictions and extend analyses to additional organisms and stresses. The conceptual frameworks and analytical approaches developed here will be applicable to other biological memory phenomena, including developmental memory, ecological memory, and transgenerational effects, ensuring lasting impact across multiple research domains.

Justification for NCEMS Support: This project requires resources beyond the capabilities of individual laboratories or existing collaborations. No single lab possesses expertise spanning epigenomics, stress biology, metabolomics, and information theory necessary for comprehensive synthesis. The computational infrastructure required for analyzing hundreds of multi-omics datasets exceeds typical lab resources. The collaborative meetings essential for integrating diverse perspectives require dedicated support. Most critically, the time commitment for comprehensive data synthesis—requiring years of effort by multiple researchers—cannot be accommodated within typical grant-funded projects focused on generating new data. NCEMS support will catalyze a synthesis effort that would not otherwise occur, leveraging the substantial public investment in data generation to extract insights impossible from individual studies. The requested budget is cost-effective, supporting synthesis of thousands of existing datasets (representing hundreds of millions of dollars in original data generation costs) to address fundamental questions about cellular memory that require this integrative, community-scale approach.",,

This synthesis project will integrate single-cell RNA-seq, single-molecule imaging data, protein abundance distributions, lineage tracing, and phenotypic profiling datasets to understand how molecular stochasticity generates functional cellular heterogeneity. By bringing together systems biologists, biophysicists, statisticians, and cell biologists, we will analyze noise propagation from transcription through protein expression to cellular phenotypes across diverse cell types and organisms. The project will synthesize data from single-cell atlases, noise measurement studies, cell fate decision datasets, and bacterial/yeast population dynamics to address: What molecular features determine noise levels? How is stochasticity filtered or amplified through regulatory networks? When is noise functional versus detrimental? We will develop statistical frameworks to decompose phenotypic variance into molecular sources, apply stochastic modeling to predict noise propagation, and identify network motifs that control variability. This addresses fundamental questions about biological individuality and decision-making that require integration of single-cell genomics, quantitative imaging, mathematical modeling, and population-level phenotyping—expertise rarely combined. The synthesis demands analysis of noise across molecular layers and biological contexts at scales impossible for single laboratories. Outputs include a cellular noise atlas quantifying variability across genes and conditions, tools for predicting phenotypic distributions from molecular parameters, standardized workflows for noise analysis, and interdisciplinary training in stochastic biology. This work will reveal design principles of cellular heterogeneity and inform strategies for controlling cell fate decisions in biotechnology and medicine.",,"Background And Significance

The fundamental observation that genetically identical cells in uniform environments display substantial phenotypic variation has transformed our understanding of biological systems. This cellular individuality, driven by stochastic molecular processes, challenges deterministic views of gene expression and cellular behavior. Over the past two decades, advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that noise in gene expression is not merely biological imprecision but a fundamental feature that influences cell fate decisions, drug resistance, developmental processes, and disease progression. Despite extensive characterization of molecular noise in isolated systems, we lack comprehensive frameworks that integrate stochasticity across molecular layers and connect it to functional cellular outcomes.

Historically, stochastic gene expression was first quantified in bacterial systems, where Elowitz and colleagues demonstrated intrinsic and extrinsic noise components using dual-reporter systems. Subsequent work in yeast and mammalian cells revealed that noise levels vary systematically across genes, with essential housekeeping genes showing lower variability than stress-response genes. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and live-cell imaging studies have provided detailed measurements of transcriptional bursting—the episodic production of mRNA molecules—establishing burst frequency and size as key determinants of expression noise. More recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has enabled genome-wide noise measurements across diverse cell types, revealing cell-type-specific noise signatures and their relationship to cellular function.

Critical advances have also emerged in understanding how noise propagates through regulatory networks. Theoretical work has identified network motifs such as negative feedback loops that buffer noise and positive feedback circuits that amplify stochasticity to generate bistable switches. Experimental studies in bacterial stress response, yeast galactose utilization, and mammalian cell fate decisions have validated these principles. However, most studies examine isolated pathways in single model systems, limiting our ability to extract general principles. Furthermore, the relationship between molecular noise and phenotypic heterogeneity remains poorly understood. While single-cell transcriptomics captures mRNA variability, proteins—the functional effectors—can show dramatically different noise profiles due to translation bursts, protein stability, and post-translational modifications.

Several key gaps limit progress in this field. First, data on noise exists in fragmented forms across different molecular layers (mRNA, protein), measurement modalities (sequencing, imaging, flow cytometry), organisms (bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells), and biological contexts (development, stress response, disease). No systematic integration has been attempted to identify universal principles versus context-specific mechanisms. Second, we lack quantitative frameworks to predict how molecular noise propagates to cellular phenotypes. While stochastic models exist for individual genes or pathways, scaling these to genome-wide predictions remains computationally and conceptually challenging. Third, the functional significance of noise—when it is adaptive versus detrimental—remains debated. Some studies suggest noise enables bet-hedging strategies and facilitates cell fate transitions, while others indicate it must be suppressed for reliable cellular function. Resolving this requires analyzing noise across diverse biological contexts with different selective pressures.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, massive single-cell datasets now exist in public repositories, including comprehensive atlases from the Human Cell Atlas, Tabula Muris, and microbial single-cell studies. These provide unprecedented opportunities to quantify noise across cell types and conditions. Second, complementary datasets measuring protein noise, transcriptional dynamics, and phenotypic outcomes are increasingly available but have never been systematically integrated. Third, computational advances in stochastic modeling, machine learning for single-cell analysis, and statistical decomposition of variance now enable sophisticated analyses previously impossible. Fourth, practical applications in synthetic biology, cell therapy, and understanding drug resistance urgently need predictive frameworks for controlling cellular heterogeneity.

Addressing these questions requires expertise spanning systems biology, biophysics, statistics, computational modeling, and experimental cell biology—disciplines that rarely collaborate at the depth required. The scale of data integration and analysis demands community-level coordination beyond individual laboratory capabilities. This project will establish the first comprehensive synthesis of cellular noise across molecular layers, biological systems, and functional contexts, providing transformative insights into the molecular basis of cellular individuality and establishing foundational principles for predicting and controlling phenotypic heterogeneity.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our understanding of stochastic gene expression and cellular heterogeneity.

Research Question 1: What molecular and regulatory features determine noise levels in gene expression across different genes, cell types, and organisms? We hypothesize that noise levels are systematically determined by a combination of gene-intrinsic features (promoter architecture, chromatin state, transcript stability) and network-level properties (regulatory connectivity, feedback structure, pathway position). Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) genes with TATA-box promoters will exhibit higher transcriptional noise than TATA-less promoters across eukaryotic systems due to differences in transcriptional bursting kinetics; (H1b) genes at network peripheries will show higher noise than hub genes with multiple regulatory inputs, which benefit from noise averaging; (H1c) noise levels will scale predictably with gene expression level following a power-law relationship, but with systematic deviations explained by regulatory architecture; and (H1d) orthologous genes will maintain similar relative noise rankings across species, suggesting evolutionary conservation of noise control mechanisms. We will test these hypotheses by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data across cell types and organisms with promoter architecture annotations, chromatin accessibility data, protein-DNA binding information, and gene regulatory network reconstructions. Statistical models will quantify the relative contribution of each feature to observed noise levels, and cross-species comparisons will identify conserved versus lineage-specific noise determinants.

Research Question 2: How is molecular stochasticity filtered, amplified, or transformed as information flows from transcription through translation to cellular phenotypes? We hypothesize that regulatory networks employ specific architectural motifs to control noise propagation, with different motifs serving distinct functional roles. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) negative feedback loops will reduce noise in their target genes proportional to feedback strength, with stronger feedback providing more effective buffering; (H2b) feedforward loops will act as noise filters, transmitting signals only when they persist beyond threshold durations, thereby filtering transient fluctuations; (H2c) post-transcriptional regulation will frequently amplify noise when translation occurs in bursts or attenuate noise when protein half-lives exceed mRNA half-lives by more than tenfold; and (H2d) phenotypic noise will be lower than molecular noise for traits determined by multiple genes due to statistical averaging, but higher for traits dependent on single rate-limiting factors. We will test these hypotheses by developing multi-layer stochastic models that integrate mRNA noise measurements from single-cell RNA-seq, protein noise data from flow cytometry and imaging studies, and phenotypic distributions from high-content screening datasets. We will identify network motifs from curated pathway databases and gene regulatory networks, then quantify noise transformation through each motif type using matched datasets measuring both inputs and outputs. Computational simulations will predict noise propagation under different network architectures, and these predictions will be validated against empirical measurements.

Research Question 3: When is stochastic gene expression functionally beneficial versus detrimental, and what evolutionary and regulatory mechanisms control noise in each context? We hypothesize that noise is adaptive in environments requiring bet-hedging or fate diversification but is suppressed in processes requiring precision and reliability. Specific predictions include: (H3a) genes involved in stress response and environmental sensing will exhibit higher noise than housekeeping genes, reflecting adaptive bet-hedging strategies; (H3b) developmental regulators will show bimodal expression distributions facilitating discrete cell fate decisions, while differentiated cell markers will show low noise maintaining stable identities; (H3c) in microbial populations, higher noise in metabolic switching genes will correlate with improved survival in fluctuating environments based on lineage tracing data; and (H3d) disease-associated genes will show altered noise profiles compared to healthy tissues, with some diseases characterized by excessive noise (loss of cellular identity) and others by insufficient noise (failure of adaptive responses). We will test these hypotheses by analyzing noise patterns across functional gene categories, integrating Gene Ontology annotations with noise measurements. Lineage tracing datasets from bacteria and mammalian cells will reveal relationships between noise and fitness outcomes. Disease-associated expression data will be compared to healthy baselines to identify pathological noise signatures. Machine learning approaches will classify genes and conditions by their noise profiles and functional outcomes, identifying features that predict when noise is beneficial.

Expected deliverables include: quantitative noise measurements for >20,000 genes across >100 cell types and conditions; validated stochastic models predicting noise propagation through regulatory networks; identification of network motifs and molecular features that control noise; classification of biological contexts where noise is adaptive versus detrimental; and predictive tools enabling researchers to estimate phenotypic distributions from molecular parameters. These outcomes will be validated through cross-dataset consistency checks, comparison of predictions against held-out test data, and assessment of model performance across diverse biological systems. Success will be measured by our ability to predict noise levels in new contexts with >70% accuracy and to identify actionable principles for noise control applicable to synthetic biology and therapeutic applications.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types through a multi-phase workflow combining data aggregation, statistical analysis, computational modeling, and validation. The project will be executed over 36 months with specific milestones and deliverables.

Data Sources and Integration (Months 1-9): We will compile comprehensive datasets spanning multiple molecular layers and biological systems. For transcriptional noise, we will aggregate single-cell RNA-seq data from: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Single Cell Portal (>500 datasets covering mammalian, yeast, and bacterial systems); Human Cell Atlas and Tabula Muris for cell-type-specific noise profiles; published smFISH datasets quantifying transcriptional bursting parameters for >1,000 genes; and time-series single-cell data capturing transcriptional dynamics. For protein-level noise, we will integrate: flow cytometry data from fluorescent reporter studies in bacteria and yeast; quantitative immunofluorescence measurements from the Human Protein Atlas; single-molecule imaging data measuring protein copy numbers; and ribosome profiling data informing translation dynamics. For phenotypic heterogeneity, we will compile: high-content imaging datasets measuring morphological and functional variability; lineage tracing data from bacterial populations and mammalian development; drug response heterogeneity data from cancer cell lines; and cell fate decision datasets from differentiation studies. Regulatory network information will come from: ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics for chromatin states; ChIP-seq data for transcription factor binding; pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome) for network topology; and eukaryotic promoter databases for architectural features. All data will be standardized using common gene identifiers, normalized expression scales, and unified metadata schemas. We will develop a centralized database with APIs enabling programmatic access and implement quality control pipelines filtering low-quality datasets based on technical metrics (sequencing depth, cell numbers, replicate consistency).

Statistical Framework Development (Months 6-18): We will develop novel statistical methods to decompose and analyze noise across datasets. For noise quantification, we will implement multiple metrics: coefficient of variation (CV), Fano factor, and distance to Poisson to capture different noise aspects; decomposition of total variance into intrinsic (gene-inherent) and extrinsic (cell-state-driven) components using dual-reporter logic where available; and Bayesian hierarchical models accounting for technical noise and batch effects in single-cell RNA-seq data. For identifying noise determinants, we will apply: regularized regression models (LASSO, elastic net) predicting noise from gene features (promoter type, expression level, network position, chromatin state); random forest and gradient boosting approaches capturing non-linear relationships; and mixed-effects models accounting for nested structure (genes within pathways within cell types). For cross-species and cross-condition comparisons, we will use: rank-based statistics robust to absolute scale differences; meta-analysis frameworks combining effect sizes across studies; and phylogenetic comparative methods testing evolutionary conservation of noise patterns. All statistical analyses will include rigorous multiple testing correction, cross-validation to prevent overfitting, and sensitivity analyses assessing robustness to methodological choices.

Computational Modeling (Months 12-27): We will develop multi-scale stochastic models predicting noise propagation. At the single-gene level, we will implement: two-state promoter models with transcriptional bursting, parameterized using smFISH and scRNA-seq data; translation models incorporating ribosome profiling data and protein stability measurements; and coupled transcription-translation models predicting protein noise from mRNA dynamics. For network-level modeling, we will construct: stochastic simulations of regulatory motifs (feedback loops, feedforward loops, cascades) using Gillespie algorithms; linear noise approximation methods enabling efficient genome-scale predictions; and moment-closure techniques balancing accuracy and computational tractability. For phenotype prediction, we will develop: multi-gene models where phenotypes depend on combinations of proteins; threshold-based models for binary cell fate decisions; and continuous models for quantitative traits. Model parameters will be estimated from data using: Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling; approximate Bayesian computation for complex models; and machine learning approaches (neural networks) learning noise transformations directly from data. Models will be validated by: comparing predictions against held-out datasets not used in training; testing predictions across species and cell types; and assessing performance on independent experimental studies.

Network Motif Analysis (Months 15-24): We will systematically identify and characterize network motifs controlling noise. Motif identification will use: graph-theoretic algorithms detecting recurring subgraphs in regulatory networks; enrichment analysis comparing motif frequencies to randomized networks; and classification of motifs by topology (feedback, feedforward, bifan). For each motif class, we will: extract all instances from integrated networks; measure noise in motif components using matched expression data; quantify noise transformation (input vs. output noise) across motif instances; and correlate motif parameters (feedback strength, time delays) with noise control effectiveness. Statistical comparisons will determine whether specific motifs consistently buffer or amplify noise across biological contexts.

Integrative Analysis and Validation (Months 24-36): We will synthesize findings across analyses to extract general principles. Comparative analyses will identify: universal noise determinants consistent across organisms; context-specific mechanisms varying by cell type or condition; and evolutionary patterns in noise control. We will develop predictive tools: web-based calculators estimating noise from gene features; software packages implementing stochastic models; and machine learning models predicting phenotypic distributions. Validation will include: retrospective prediction of noise in published studies; prospective predictions for new datasets released during the project; and comparison with independent noise measurements from orthogonal technologies. We will conduct sensitivity analyses assessing how conclusions depend on dataset selection, statistical methods, and modeling assumptions.

Timeline and Milestones: Months 1-9: Data aggregation complete, database operational; Months 6-18: Statistical frameworks developed, initial noise atlas released; Months 12-27: Stochastic models implemented, motif analysis complete; Months 24-36: Integrative synthesis, tool development, manuscript preparation. Quarterly working group meetings will coordinate activities, and annual workshops will engage the broader community. All code, data, and analysis workflows will be deposited in public repositories (GitHub, Zenodo) following FAIR principles, with comprehensive documentation enabling reproducibility.

The frameworks developed will be applicable to other biological questions requiring integration of heterogeneous data, serving as a model for future synthesis efforts. Ultimately, this project will shift the paradigm from viewing cellular heterogeneity as experimental noise to recognizing it as a fundamental biological feature with predictable principles and functional significance, opening new avenues for understanding and manipulating cellular behavior.

The project will synthesize data from the Cell Image Library, Human Protein Atlas, spatial omics databases, and morphological profiling studies to address: What molecular properties determine subcellular localization patterns? How do cells maintain spatial organization during growth? What physical constraints shape cellular geometry? We will apply spatial statistics, polymer physics models, and machine learning to predict spatial organization from molecular features, identify scaling laws governing organelle sizes, and determine how spatial organization varies across cell types and species. This requires integration of imaging data, biophysical measurements, spatial omics, and theoretical modeling at scales beyond individual laboratories. Deliverables include a cellular geometry atlas mapping spatial organization principles, predictive tools for subcellular localization and organelle properties, image analysis workflows for spatial pattern quantification, and training programs bridging cell biology and physical sciences. This resource will reveal fundamental principles of cellular self-organization and provide frameworks for engineering synthetic cells with designed spatial properties.",,"Background And Significance

The spatial organization of cellular components represents one of the most fundamental yet poorly understood aspects of cell biology. While molecular biology has made tremendous progress in identifying cellular components and their biochemical functions, understanding how these molecules self-organize into the precise three-dimensional architecture characteristic of living cells remains a grand challenge. Cells maintain remarkably consistent spatial arrangements of organelles, cytoskeletal networks, and molecular assemblies despite constant molecular turnover and environmental perturbations. This spatial precision is essential for cellular function, as demonstrated by numerous diseases arising from disrupted cellular organization, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and developmental disorders.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented quantities of spatial data about cells. High-resolution imaging techniques including electron microscopy tomography, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, and correlative light-electron microscopy now routinely capture cellular architecture at nanometer resolution. The Human Protein Atlas has systematically mapped the subcellular localization of thousands of proteins across multiple cell types. Spatial transcriptomics and proteomics technologies reveal the spatial distribution of molecular species within cells and tissues. Large-scale morphological profiling studies have characterized how genetic and chemical perturbations affect cellular geometry. The Cell Image Library, Image Data Resource, and other repositories now contain millions of high-quality cellular images. Despite this wealth of data, these datasets remain largely siloed within individual studies and disciplines, preventing comprehensive synthesis that could reveal general principles of cellular spatial organization.

Current understanding of cellular geometry is fragmented across multiple disciplines. Cell biologists have identified specific localization signals and trafficking pathways for individual proteins but lack frameworks for predicting spatial organization from molecular properties. Biophysicists have developed theoretical models for specific phenomena like spindle positioning or organelle size control, but these models are rarely validated against comprehensive spatial datasets or generalized across systems. Image analysis methods can quantify spatial patterns but often lack connection to underlying molecular mechanisms. This fragmentation prevents answering fundamental questions: What universal principles govern cellular spatial organization? How do molecular properties encode spatial information? What physical constraints shape cellular geometry across scales?

Several key gaps limit progress in understanding cellular geometry. First, we lack systematic frameworks connecting molecular properties (size, charge, hydrophobicity, binding affinities) to emergent spatial patterns. While specific localization mechanisms are known for individual proteins, predictive principles applicable across the proteome remain elusive. Second, the relationship between cellular spatial organization and cell size, shape, and growth dynamics is poorly characterized. Cells must coordinate spatial organization during growth and division, but the scaling laws and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Third, we do not understand how spatial organization varies across cell types, developmental stages, and species, limiting our ability to identify conserved principles versus context-specific adaptations. Fourth, existing theoretical frameworks from physics and mathematics are underutilized in analyzing cellular spatial data, representing a missed opportunity for deeper mechanistic insight.

This research is timely for several reasons. The maturation of spatial biology technologies and accumulation of public datasets now enables synthesis at unprecedented scale. Machine learning approaches can now extract patterns from complex spatial data and predict organization from molecular features. Growing interest in synthetic cell engineering creates urgent need for design principles based on natural cellular organization. The convergence of cell biology, biophysics, and data science creates unique opportunities for transformative insights that require truly interdisciplinary collaboration. This synthesis project addresses these opportunities by integrating diverse data types and analytical approaches to decode the rules governing cellular geometry. Understanding these principles will transform our ability to predict cellular organization, interpret spatial perturbations in disease, and engineer synthetic cellular systems with designed spatial properties.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes.

Research Question 1: What molecular properties determine subcellular localization patterns and spatial organization? We hypothesize that subcellular localization can be predicted from intrinsic molecular properties including amino acid composition, predicted structural features, post-translational modification sites, and biophysical parameters such as charge, hydrophobicity, and intrinsic disorder. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Machine learning models trained on molecular sequence and structure features can predict subcellular localization with accuracy exceeding current methods by integrating spatial imaging data with protein property databases. (H1b) Proteins sharing similar spatial distributions exhibit convergent molecular properties even without sequence homology, revealing physical principles underlying localization. (H1c) Spatial localization patterns can be decomposed into a limited set of fundamental spatial modes corresponding to distinct biophysical mechanisms (membrane targeting, phase separation, active transport, etc.). We will test these hypotheses by integrating Human Protein Atlas localization data with UniProt protein properties, AlphaFold structures, and post-translational modification databases, applying dimensionality reduction and supervised learning to identify molecular features predictive of spatial patterns. Validation will involve testing predictions on held-out proteins and comparing predicted versus observed localization in independent datasets.

Research Question 2: How do cells maintain spatial organization during growth, and what scaling laws govern organelle sizes and positions? We hypothesize that cellular spatial organization follows quantitative scaling relationships with cell size, and that these relationships reflect fundamental physical constraints and regulatory mechanisms. Specifically: (H2a) Organelle sizes scale with cell volume following power laws with exponents reflecting their biogenesis mechanisms (surface-limited organelles scale as volume^2/3, volume-limited organelles scale as volume^1). (H2b) Organelle positions relative to cell boundaries and other organelles are maintained through active sensing mechanisms that scale with cell dimensions. (H2c) Spatial organization transitions occur at critical cell sizes corresponding to physical instabilities or regulatory thresholds. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing correlations between cell morphology and organelle properties across thousands of cells from morphological profiling datasets, Cell Image Library, and published imaging studies. We will fit scaling models to organelle size and position data across cell size ranges, identifying deviations from predicted scaling that indicate active regulation. Time-lapse imaging datasets will reveal how spatial organization changes during cell growth and division.

Research Question 3: What physical constraints and mechanisms shape cellular geometry across cell types and species? We hypothesize that cellular spatial organization reflects universal physical principles modulated by cell-type-specific molecular components. Specifically: (H3a) Spatial organization patterns cluster into discrete cellular architectures corresponding to major cell types and functional states. (H3b) Conserved spatial relationships between organelles reflect physical constraints (excluded volume, membrane contact sites, cytoskeletal coupling) that are invariant across cell types. (H3c) Variation in spatial organization across species follows phylogenetic patterns for conserved features but shows convergent evolution for functionally analogous structures. We will test these hypotheses through comparative analysis of spatial organization across cell types in Human Protein Atlas, across species in Cell Image Library and published datasets, and across functional states in perturbation studies. Spatial statistics will quantify organelle-organelle relationships, and phylogenetic comparative methods will distinguish conserved versus convergent spatial features.

Expected outcomes include: (1) Quantitative models predicting subcellular localization from molecular properties with validated accuracy metrics. (2) Comprehensive characterization of scaling relationships governing organelle properties across cell sizes. (3) Classification of cellular spatial architectures and identification of conserved spatial principles. (4) Mechanistic insights into physical constraints shaping cellular geometry. (5) Publicly available datasets, analysis code, and predictive tools. Validation strategies include cross-validation within datasets, testing predictions on independent datasets, comparison with experimental perturbations, and consistency checks across multiple data types. Success criteria include statistically significant improvements over existing prediction methods, identification of novel scaling relationships, and experimental validation of key predictions by collaborators or the broader community.

(2) Organelle level: size, shape, position relative to cell boundaries and other organelles, number per cell. (3) Whole-cell level: overall spatial organization, symmetry, polarization. Spatial statistics will include pair correlation functions, Ripley's K-function, spatial autocorrelation, and persistent homology to capture multi-scale spatial relationships. Feature extraction will be parallelized across computing clusters to process millions of images. All analysis code will be version-controlled and containerized for reproducibility.

Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, autoencoders) will identify key molecular features associated with spatial patterns. Supervised learning models (random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) will predict localization from molecular features, with rigorous cross-validation and testing on held-out proteins. Model interpretation methods (SHAP values, attention mechanisms) will identify which molecular properties drive predictions. We will compare performance against existing localization prediction tools and quantify improvements.

Scaling Analysis and Physical Modeling (Months 12-24): We will characterize quantitative relationships between cell geometry and spatial organization. Scaling analysis will fit power-law and other functional forms relating organelle properties to cell size, testing for deviations indicating active regulation. Physical models will be developed based on polymer physics (cytoskeletal organization), phase separation thermodynamics (biomolecular condensates), reaction-diffusion systems (spatial pattern formation), and mechanical models (organelle positioning). Model parameters will be constrained by experimental measurements from literature. Simulations will test whether physical models can reproduce observed spatial patterns and scaling relationships. Sensitivity analysis will identify critical parameters governing spatial organization.

Comparative and Evolutionary Analysis (Months 18-30): We will analyze spatial organization across cell types and species. Clustering analysis will group cells by spatial organization patterns, identifying discrete cellular architectures. Comparative analysis will quantify conservation and variation in spatial features across cell types and species. Phylogenetic comparative methods will test for correlated evolution of spatial features and molecular components. Network analysis will identify conserved spatial relationships between organelles.

This synthesis project will integrate phosphoproteomics, signaling pathway databases, perturbation-response datasets, single-cell signaling dynamics, and phenotypic outcome data to decode the computational logic of cellular decision-making. By uniting signal transduction biologists, systems biologists, control theorists, and computational neuroscientists, we will analyze how cells encode, process, and decode information in signaling networks. The project will synthesize data from PhosphoSitePlus, SIGNOR, perturbation databases (LINCS), and time-resolved signaling studies across diverse cell types and stimuli to address: How do cells distinguish between similar signals?

This work will reveal design principles of cellular computation and enable rational manipulation of cell fate decisions for therapeutic applications.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular decision-making represents one of the most fundamental yet incompletely understood processes in biology. Cells continuously receive and integrate multiple extracellular signals—growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and stress signals—to determine appropriate responses such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, or apoptosis. While individual signaling pathways have been extensively characterized, the systems-level principles governing how cells process combinatorial signals to generate specific, context-dependent outcomes remain elusive. This knowledge gap represents a critical barrier to understanding normal physiology and developing rational therapeutic interventions for diseases characterized by aberrant cellular decision-making, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and developmental abnormalities.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented quantities of molecular data characterizing signaling networks. Phosphoproteomics studies have catalogued thousands of phosphorylation events across diverse cellular contexts, revealing the complexity of post-translational signaling cascades. Time-resolved measurements using biosensors and single-cell technologies have captured signaling dynamics with temporal precision, demonstrating that cells encode information not only in signal amplitude but also in frequency, duration, and temporal patterns. Perturbation studies, particularly those in the LINCS program, have systematically profiled cellular responses to thousands of genetic and chemical perturbations. Simultaneously, comprehensive pathway databases have curated decades of mechanistic knowledge about signaling interactions. However, these rich data resources remain largely siloed within their respective domains, analyzed independently rather than synthesized to address integrative questions about cellular computation.

Current understanding of signaling networks faces several critical limitations. First, most studies focus on individual pathways in isolation, despite extensive evidence of crosstalk and integration across pathways. The MAPK, PI3K-AKT, JAK-STAT, and TGF-β pathways, among others, do not operate independently but form interconnected networks with shared components and regulatory nodes. Second, signaling research has traditionally emphasized static pathway diagrams rather than dynamic information processing. Yet cells distinguish between sustained versus transient signals, decode oscillatory patterns, and implement temporal filtering—computational operations requiring dynamic analysis frameworks. Third, the relationship between signaling network architecture and computational function remains poorly defined. While specific network motifs like feedforward loops and negative feedback have been characterized, we lack systematic understanding of how network topology enables particular information processing capabilities.

The challenge of decoding cellular signaling logic exceeds the capabilities of individual laboratories for several reasons. It requires integration of heterogeneous data types—phosphoproteomics, pathway topology, perturbation responses, temporal dynamics, and phenotypic outcomes—each demanding specialized expertise. The scale of analysis, spanning hundreds of signaling proteins across diverse cell types, stimuli, and conditions, necessitates computational infrastructure and analytical approaches beyond typical single-lab resources. Most critically, addressing how cells compute requires perspectives from multiple disciplines: signal transduction biology provides mechanistic knowledge, systems biology offers network analysis frameworks, control theory contributes principles of feedback and regulation, information theory enables quantification of information transmission, and computational neuroscience provides models of distributed computation. No single research group possesses this breadth of expertise.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the maturation of public data repositories now provides sufficient data density to enable cross-dataset integration and meta-analysis. Second, recent conceptual advances in understanding biological information processing, particularly from neuroscience and synthetic biology, offer new frameworks applicable to signaling networks. Third, emerging therapeutic modalities, including combination therapies and cell-based therapeutics, require predictive understanding of how cells respond to multiple simultaneous signals. Finally, the field increasingly recognizes that reductionist approaches, while essential for mechanistic detail, must be complemented by integrative synthesis to understand systems-level principles. This project addresses a fundamental question in cellular biology—how do molecular networks implement computation—while developing generalizable frameworks, analytical tools, and training approaches that will benefit the broader community studying cellular information processing.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance understanding of cellular decision-making at the systems level.

Research Question 1: How do cells distinguish between similar extracellular signals to generate specific, context-appropriate responses? Many growth factors and cytokines activate overlapping signaling pathways, yet cells produce distinct outcomes. For example, EGF and NGF both activate MAPK signaling in PC12 cells, but EGF induces proliferation while NGF triggers differentiation. We hypothesize that cells encode signal identity through combinatorial activation patterns across multiple pathways, temporal dynamics of signaling activity, and differential engagement of feedback mechanisms. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Signal specificity correlates with the number of distinctly activated pathways rather than any single pathway's activity; (H1b) Temporal features—including signal duration, oscillation frequency, and rise time—carry information distinguishing similar stimuli; (H1c) Cell-type-specific wiring of feedback loops creates context-dependent signal interpretation. We will test these hypotheses by integrating phosphoproteomics data capturing pathway activation patterns, time-resolved biosensor measurements revealing temporal dynamics, and perturbation data showing how feedback disruption alters signal discrimination. Expected outcomes include quantitative metrics of signal distinguishability, identification of temporal features most informative for signal identity, and maps of cell-type-specific feedback architectures.

Research Question 2: What network architectures and motifs enable specific computational operations in signaling networks? Cells perform sophisticated computations including signal amplification, noise filtering, coincidence detection, and temporal integration. We hypothesize that specific network topologies implement distinct computational functions, analogous to how circuit architectures in neuroscience enable particular computations. We predict that: (H2a) Coherent feedforward loops enable temporal filtering, distinguishing transient from sustained signals; (H2b) Negative feedback loops implement adaptation and maintain homeostasis; (H2c) Positive feedback with mutual inhibition creates bistable switches for irreversible decisions; (H2d) Distributed network architectures enable multiplexing, where the same molecules participate in multiple computations depending on context. We will test these hypotheses by systematically identifying network motifs in integrated pathway databases, correlating motif presence with computational behaviors observed in dynamic signaling data, and using perturbation data to validate predicted motif functions. Control theory will provide mathematical frameworks for analyzing feedback systems, while Boolean and continuous modeling will simulate how specific architectures generate observed behaviors. Expected deliverables include a catalog of signaling network motifs with associated computational functions, validated models predicting how network perturbations alter information processing, and design principles for engineering desired cellular computations.

Research Question 3: How is signaling logic rewired in disease states, and can we predict therapeutic vulnerabilities from network architecture? Cancer cells, for example, often exhibit altered signaling responses, including growth factor independence and resistance to apoptotic signals. We hypothesize that disease-associated mutations and expression changes systematically rewire signaling logic by altering network topology, feedback strength, and information flow. Specifically, we predict that: (H3a) Oncogenic mutations preferentially disrupt negative feedback loops, leading to sustained rather than transient signaling; (H3b) Drug resistance emerges through compensatory pathway activation that restores computational functions despite targeted inhibition; (H3c) Network architecture predicts combination therapy effectiveness, with synergistic drug pairs targeting complementary nodes in information flow. We will test these hypotheses by comparing signaling network architectures between normal and disease states using integrated phosphoproteomics and pathway data, analyzing how perturbations (including therapeutic compounds from LINCS) differentially affect normal versus rewired networks, and applying information theory to quantify how disease alters signaling channel capacity and fidelity. Expected outcomes include maps of disease-associated network rewiring, predictive models identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities based on network architecture, and principles for rational combination therapy design.

Cross-cutting all three questions, we will develop and validate generalizable frameworks for analyzing signaling logic. We hypothesize that information-theoretic measures—including mutual information between inputs and outputs, channel capacity, and information transmission rates—provide quantitative metrics for comparing signaling systems across cell types and conditions. We will validate our frameworks by testing predictions in held-out datasets not used for model development, ensuring generalizability. All hypotheses will be tested using multiple, independent data sources to ensure robustness, and we will explicitly quantify uncertainty in our predictions. The synthesis of diverse data types and analytical approaches will yield insights unattainable from any single dataset or methodology, revealing fundamental principles of cellular information processing.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates heterogeneous public datasets through a multi-phase analytical pipeline, combining data harmonization, network reconstruction, dynamic modeling, and information-theoretic analysis. The project spans 36 months with specific milestones and deliverables.

Data Sources and Integration (Months 1-6): We will compile and harmonize data from multiple public repositories. PhosphoSitePlus provides curated phosphorylation sites and their regulatory relationships across >100,000 experiments. SIGNOR and Pathway Commons contain manually curated signaling pathway interactions with >25,000 causal relationships. The LINCS L1000 dataset includes transcriptional responses to >40,000 perturbations across multiple cell lines, while the LINCS P100 phosphoproteomics dataset captures signaling responses to kinase inhibitors. We will incorporate time-resolved signaling data from published studies deposited in repositories including GEO and ProteomeXchange, focusing on datasets with temporal resolution <1 hour and multiple time points. Single-cell signaling data from multiplexed immunofluorescence and mass cytometry studies will capture cell-to-cell variability. Phenotypic outcome data linking signaling states to cellular decisions (proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation) will be extracted from systematic perturbation studies. Data harmonization will address identifier mapping across databases, normalization of measurements from different platforms, and quality control filtering. We will develop a unified data model representing signaling networks as multi-layer graphs with nodes (proteins, phosphorylation sites), edges (regulatory interactions), temporal dynamics (time-series measurements), and phenotypic annotations. Milestone: Integrated database with harmonized signaling data across ≥20 cell types and ≥50 stimuli.

Network Reconstruction and Topology Analysis (Months 4-12): We will reconstruct cell-type-specific signaling networks by integrating pathway databases with phosphoproteomics data indicating which interactions are active in each context. Network topology will be analyzed using graph-theoretic measures including degree distribution, betweenness centrality, and community structure. We will systematically identify network motifs—recurring patterns like feedforward loops, feedback loops, and bifan motifs—using established algorithms adapted for directed, signed networks. Motif enrichment analysis will determine which architectures are overrepresented compared to randomized networks. For each cell type and stimulus condition, we will construct context-specific networks weighted by phosphorylation intensity and interaction confidence. Comparative network analysis will identify conserved versus cell-type-specific architectures. We will apply community detection algorithms to identify functional modules and analyze information flow between modules. Milestone: Atlas of cell-type-specific signaling network architectures with annotated motifs and modules.

Dynamic Modeling and Temporal Analysis (Months 7-18): Time-resolved signaling data will be analyzed to extract temporal features including peak amplitude, time to peak, duration, oscillation frequency, and decay rate. We will develop Boolean network models for discrete signaling logic and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models for continuous dynamics. Boolean models will be parameterized using perturbation data to determine logical rules (AND, OR gates) governing each node's activation. ODE models will incorporate mass-action kinetics for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions, with parameters estimated from temporal data using optimization algorithms. Model validation will use cross-validation, training on subsets of stimuli and testing predictions on held-out conditions. We will perform sensitivity analysis to identify critical parameters and network nodes. Control theory approaches will analyze feedback loop strength, stability, and response to perturbations.

This resource will reveal fundamental aging mechanisms and identify targets for extending cellular healthspan.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular aging represents one of the most fundamental biological processes, underlying organismal senescence, age-related diseases, and ultimately mortality. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms driving cellular aging remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding how different types of molecular damage accumulate, interact, and collectively drive functional decline. The field has generated extensive data across multiple model organisms and damage modalities, yet these datasets remain largely siloed, preventing comprehensive understanding of aging as an integrated, multi-factorial process.

Current theories of aging propose various molecular damage types as primary drivers: the free radical theory emphasizes oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA; the DNA damage theory focuses on genomic instability; the protein homeostasis theory highlights proteostatic collapse; and the mitochondrial theory emphasizes bioenergetic decline. Each theory is supported by substantial evidence, yet none fully explains aging phenotypes. Recent work suggests aging results from complex interactions among multiple damage types, but systematic analysis of these interactions across organisms and interventions is lacking. The fragmented nature of existing research—with different labs focusing on specific damage types, organisms, or interventions—has prevented synthesis of a unified framework.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented longitudinal datasets tracking molecular changes during aging. Large-scale transcriptomic studies have profiled age-related gene expression changes across tissues and species. Proteomic and metabolomic studies have revealed age-dependent alterations in cellular biochemistry. Epigenomic studies have identified aging-associated chromatin modifications and DNA methylation patterns (epigenetic clocks). Damage-specific measurements have quantified DNA lesions, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction across lifespans. Cellular senescence markers have been tracked in aging tissues. Functional assays have measured age-related declines in cellular processes including autophagy, stress resistance, and metabolic capacity. Critically, interventional studies using dietary restriction, genetic manipulations, and pharmacological treatments have demonstrated that aging rate is malleable, providing natural experiments to distinguish causal drivers from passive consequences.

Despite this wealth of data, fundamental questions remain unanswered. Which molecular damages are primary causes versus secondary consequences of aging? Do different damage types act independently or synergistically? What determines the substantial variation in aging rates among individuals, even within genetically identical populations? Are there critical damage thresholds that trigger accelerated decline? Which aging mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved versus species-specific? These questions cannot be answered by individual studies or single-modality analyses; they require systematic integration of diverse datasets across damage types, organisms, and interventions.

Several key gaps limit current understanding. First, most aging studies are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, preventing analysis of temporal trajectories and causal relationships. Second, studies typically measure single damage types in isolation, missing interactions among damage modalities. Third, comparative analyses across species are rare, limiting identification of conserved mechanisms. Fourth, interventional studies are analyzed independently rather than synthesized to identify common mechanisms. Fifth, existing analytical approaches lack sophisticated causal inference methods to distinguish drivers from passengers in correlative aging data.

This synthesis project addresses these gaps by integrating existing public datasets to construct comprehensive, multi-scale models of cellular aging. The project is timely for several reasons. First, sufficient longitudinal multi-omics data now exists across multiple model organisms to enable robust comparative analyses. Second, major aging databases (GenAge, CellAge, JenAge) have curated aging-related genes, interventions, and phenotypes, providing structured knowledge bases. Third, recent methodological advances in causal inference, network analysis, and multi-scale modeling enable sophisticated analysis of complex aging data. Fourth, the aging field increasingly recognizes the need for integrative approaches, creating receptive audiences for synthesis findings. Fifth, understanding cellular aging mechanisms has urgent societal relevance given aging populations and the burden of age-related diseases.

The proposed synthesis requires multidisciplinary collaboration beyond individual laboratory capabilities. It demands expertise in gerontology (understanding aging biology), molecular biology (interpreting damage mechanisms), systems biology (network and pathway analysis), comparative biology (cross-species synthesis), biostatistics (causal inference and longitudinal analysis), and bioinformatics (data integration and tool development). No single laboratory possesses this breadth of expertise or access to the diverse datasets required. The project exemplifies community-scale synthesis by integrating existing public data, requiring collaborative expertise, and addressing questions beyond individual laboratory scope. Success will provide the aging field with unified frameworks, predictive models, analytical tools, and training resources to accelerate discovery of fundamental aging mechanisms and therapeutic targets for extending cellular healthspan.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will fundamentally advance understanding of cellular aging mechanisms.

Research Question 1: Which molecular damage types are primary causes versus secondary consequences of cellular aging? The field has identified numerous age-associated molecular changes, but distinguishing causal drivers from passive consequences remains challenging. We hypothesize that primary damage types will exhibit three characteristics: (1) temporal precedence—appearing early in aging trajectories before functional decline; (2) dose-response relationships—showing graded associations with aging rate across interventions; and (3) causal necessity—being required for aging phenotypes based on genetic and interventional evidence. We predict that DNA damage, particularly in heterochromatic regions, and mitochondrial dysfunction will emerge as primary drivers, while many protein oxidation events will appear as secondary consequences. This hypothesis will be tested by applying Granger causality analysis and convergent cross-mapping to longitudinal multi-omics data to identify temporal precedence, performing meta-analysis of interventional studies to assess dose-response relationships, and integrating genetic loss-of-function data to evaluate necessity. Expected outcomes include a hierarchical classification of damage types by causal priority and identification of 5-10 primary aging drivers conserved across species.

Research Question 2: How do different molecular damage types interact to drive cellular aging, and are there synergistic or antagonistic relationships? Aging likely results from complex damage interactions rather than independent processes, yet systematic analysis of these interactions is lacking. We hypothesize that molecular damages form interconnected networks with three interaction types: (1) cascade relationships where one damage type triggers others (e.g., DNA damage inducing mitochondrial dysfunction); (2) synergistic interactions where combined damages exceed additive effects; and (3) compensatory relationships where one damage type buffers against others. We predict that DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction will show strong synergistic interactions, that proteostatic stress will cascade from both, and that autophagy upregulation will show compensatory relationships with multiple damage types. Testing will involve constructing damage interaction networks from correlation structures in longitudinal data, identifying synergistic interactions through statistical interaction terms in regression models predicting functional decline, and validating predicted interactions against interventional studies targeting multiple pathways simultaneously. Expected outcomes include comprehensive damage interaction maps for each model organism, quantification of interaction strengths, and identification of critical damage combinations that accelerate aging.

Research Question 3: What molecular and cellular factors determine variation in aging rates among individuals and across interventions? Even genetically identical organisms show substantial variation in lifespan and healthspan, suggesting stochastic or environmental factors modulate aging rate. We hypothesize that aging rate variation is determined by: (1) initial damage levels and damage accumulation rates; (2) cellular maintenance capacity (DNA repair, proteostasis, mitochondrial quality control); and (3) damage threshold effects where exceeding critical levels triggers accelerated decline. We predict that individuals with higher initial maintenance capacity will show slower damage accumulation, that damage accumulation follows non-linear trajectories with acceleration after threshold crossing, and that successful aging interventions primarily enhance maintenance capacity rather than reducing damage generation. Testing will involve variance decomposition analysis of longitudinal aging data to quantify contributions of initial states versus trajectories, trajectory clustering to identify distinct aging patterns, threshold detection using changepoint analysis and piecewise regression, and comparative analysis of interventional mechanisms. Expected outcomes include predictive models for individual aging trajectories based on early-life measurements, identification of critical damage thresholds for major aging phenotypes, and mechanistic classification of aging interventions by their effects on damage generation versus maintenance capacity.

Research Question 4: Which cellular aging mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved versus species-specific, and what explains these differences? Understanding conservation patterns is essential for translating findings across model organisms to human aging. We hypothesize that: (1) core damage types (DNA damage, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction) and their interactions are conserved across eukaryotes; (2) damage accumulation rates and thresholds vary with species lifespan, reflecting evolved maintenance capacity; and (3) species-specific mechanisms relate to unique physiological features (e.g., post-mitotic tissues in mammals, desiccation resistance in nematodes). We predict that damage interaction networks will show conserved topology but species-specific edge weights, that longer-lived species will exhibit higher damage thresholds and slower accumulation rates for conserved damage types, and that species-specific aging mechanisms will map to lineage-specific genes and pathways. Testing will involve comparative network analysis across species to identify conserved versus variable features, phylogenetic comparative methods to correlate damage parameters with species lifespan, and enrichment analysis to identify species-specific pathways. Expected outcomes include a comparative aging atlas highlighting conserved mechanisms suitable for cross-species translation, species-specific aging mechanisms requiring organism-appropriate models, and evolutionary insights into how longevity evolves through modulation of conserved aging processes.

Integrated across these questions, we will develop multi-scale computational models linking molecular damage accumulation to cellular dysfunction and organismal aging phenotypes. These models will incorporate damage generation rates, interaction networks, maintenance capacities, and threshold effects, parameterized from synthesized data. Model validation will involve predicting outcomes of held-out interventional studies and testing predictions against independent datasets. Success will provide mechanistic understanding of cellular aging as an integrated, multi-factorial process, enabling rational design of interventions targeting causal drivers and critical interactions to extend cellular healthspan.

We will prioritize datasets with at least 5 timepoints spanning substantial portions of lifespan. Damage-specific measurements will include DNA damage markers (γH2AX, 8-oxoguanine, telomere length), protein damage (carbonylation, aggregation, ubiquitination), lipid peroxidation (MDA, 4-HNE), and mitochondrial function (membrane potential, ROS production, respiration rates) from published studies. Cellular senescence data will include SA-β-gal, p16/p21 expression, and SASP factors. Functional assays will encompass stress resistance, autophagy flux, proteasome activity, and metabolic measurements. Interventional study data will include dietary restriction, genetic manipulations (IIS pathway, mTOR, sirtuins, mitochondrial genes), and pharmacological treatments (rapamycin, metformin, NAD+ precursors).

Interventional calculus will leverage interventional study data to estimate causal effects. Mediation analysis will identify pathways through which interventions affect aging. We will integrate evidence across temporal precedence, dose-response relationships from interventions, genetic necessity from loss-of-function studies, and evolutionary conservation to assign causal confidence scores to each damage type. Meta-analysis will synthesize effect sizes across studies. Milestone: Ranked list of aging drivers with causal evidence scores.

Ordinary differential equation models will represent damage accumulation, interactions, and maintenance processes. Agent-based models will simulate cellular heterogeneity and stochastic effects. Machine learning models (random forests, neural networks) will predict aging outcomes from molecular profiles. Models will be parameterized using synthesized data and validated through cross-validation and prediction of held-out interventional studies. Sensitivity analysis will identify critical parameters. We will develop models at multiple scales: molecular (damage accumulation), cellular (functional decline), and organismal (lifespan/healthspan). Milestone: Validated predictive models for aging trajectories and intervention effects.

Comparative and Evolutionary Analysis (Months 31-33): We will perform systematic comparative analysis to identify conserved mechanisms and evolutionary patterns.

Cellular robustness—the ability of biological systems to maintain function despite genetic mutations, environmental stresses, and stochastic fluctuations—represents one of the most fundamental yet poorly understood properties of living systems. This robustness emerges from complex molecular networks that employ redundancy, compensation, and buffering mechanisms to ensure cellular viability and phenotypic stability. Understanding the molecular basis of cellular robustness has profound implications for basic biology, evolutionary theory, and translational medicine, yet our knowledge remains fragmented across disparate experimental approaches and model systems.

The importance of robustness mechanisms became evident through classical genetic studies revealing synthetic lethal interactions, where simultaneous disruption of two individually non-essential genes causes lethality. Early work in yeast by Hartman et al. (2001) and subsequent large-scale genetic interaction mapping efforts have identified thousands of such interactions, suggesting extensive redundancy networks. More recently, systematic CRISPR and RNAi screening campaigns in human cells have revealed that only 10-15% of genes are individually essential, yet cells remain vulnerable to combinatorial perturbations. This paradox highlights our incomplete understanding of how robustness architectures are organized at the molecular level.

Current research has identified several mechanisms contributing to cellular robustness. Genetic redundancy through gene duplication provides backup copies of critical functions, with paralogs often compensating for each other's loss. Transcriptional compensation, recently characterized through studies of genetic knockouts versus knockdowns, reveals that cells can upregulate related genes in response to genetic perturbations. Network-level buffering through alternative pathways and distributed functions provides additional layers of protection. However, these mechanisms have been studied largely in isolation, using different experimental systems, perturbation methods, and analytical frameworks.

Several critical gaps limit our understanding of cellular robustness. First, we lack systematic maps of redundancy and compensation networks that integrate different types of genetic interactions, expression responses, and phenotypic outcomes. Existing genetic interaction databases like BioGRID contain millions of interactions, but these have not been systematically analyzed to identify robustness architectures. Second, the relationship between network topology and robustness capacity remains unclear. While theoretical work suggests that certain network motifs confer robustness, empirical validation across real biological networks is limited. Third, the evolutionary origins and maintenance of redundancy are debated—distinguishing functional redundancy selected for robustness from neutral degeneracy arising through drift requires integrating genetic interaction data with evolutionary analysis. Fourth, we cannot predict when compensation will fail, limiting our ability to understand disease mechanisms or exploit synthetic lethality therapeutically.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented data resources that make comprehensive synthesis possible. Genome-wide CRISPR screens in multiple cell types and organisms provide systematic perturbation data. RNA-sequencing of knockout strains reveals transcriptional compensation responses. Proteomics studies map protein interaction networks and abundance changes. Comparative genomics across species enables evolutionary analysis of redundancy. However, these datasets remain siloed in different repositories, analyzed with incompatible methods, and interpreted through discipline-specific frameworks. No single laboratory possesses the expertise to integrate genetic, genomic, proteomic, network, and evolutionary data required for comprehensive understanding.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the maturation of public data repositories now provides sufficient coverage for systematic analysis. Second, recent discoveries of transcriptional compensation mechanisms and CRISPR-Cas9 off-target compensation highlight the complexity of robustness that demands integrated analysis. Third, the clinical importance of predicting synthetic lethality for cancer therapy and understanding drug resistance mechanisms creates urgent need for robustness frameworks. Fourth, emerging network analysis and machine learning methods enable integration of heterogeneous data types at unprecedented scale. Finally, the field has reached a critical juncture where synthesis across disciplines can resolve long-standing questions about biological robustness that individual experimental approaches cannot address. This project will transform our understanding of how cells achieve robustness and establish frameworks for predicting system-level responses to perturbations.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions that require integration of genetic interaction data, expression profiling, network analysis, and evolutionary genomics—expertise and data types that exceed single-laboratory capabilities.

Research Question 1: What network architectures and organizational principles underlie cellular robustness? We hypothesize that cellular robustness emerges from hierarchical network organization where redundancy operates at multiple scales—from paralogous gene pairs to functionally overlapping pathways to distributed network modules. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Genetic interactions cluster into modular redundancy units characterized by specific topological features including high within-module connectivity and functional coherence; (H1b) Essential cellular processes are protected by layered redundancy, with backup mechanisms at gene, pathway, and network levels; (H1c) Network centrality metrics alone poorly predict robustness, but integration with genetic interaction patterns and expression compensation data will reveal composite features that accurately identify robustness-conferring architectures. We will test these hypotheses by applying community detection algorithms to integrated genetic interaction networks, analyzing topological properties of redundant modules, and correlating network features with phenotypic robustness measures across perturbation datasets. Expected outcomes include identification of recurrent network motifs associated with robustness, quantitative models relating network topology to compensation capacity, and a hierarchical map of robustness architectures across cellular processes.

Research Question 2: How does genetic redundancy evolve, and what distinguishes functional redundancy maintained by selection from neutral degeneracy arising through drift? We hypothesize that functionally redundant gene pairs show signatures of selection for maintained compensation capacity, while neutral degeneracy shows evolutionary patterns consistent with drift. Specifically, we predict that: (H2a) Gene pairs with strong genetic interactions (synthetic lethality or synthetic sickness) show evidence of purifying selection maintaining compensation capacity, including constrained sequence divergence in regulatory regions and preserved expression patterns; (H2b) Redundancy arising from recent duplications shows different compensation mechanisms (sequence-level backup) compared to ancient duplications (network-level backup through diverged functions); (H2c) Lineage-specific gene losses correlate with compensatory network rewiring detectable through altered genetic interaction patterns in different species. We will test these hypotheses by integrating genetic interaction data with comparative genomics across yeast, nematode, fly, and mammalian species, analyzing evolutionary rates and selection signatures in redundant gene pairs, and reconstructing ancestral redundancy networks. Expected outcomes include evolutionary classification of redundancy types, identification of selection pressures maintaining robustness, and principles governing how redundancy networks evolve and rewire across lineages.

Research Question 3: When and why does cellular compensation fail, and can we predict contexts where robustness breaks down? We hypothesize that compensation failure occurs through specific, predictable mechanisms including saturation of buffering capacity, disruption of compensatory regulatory circuits, and context-dependent loss of redundancy. Specifically, we predict that: (H3a) Compensation fails when perturbations simultaneously affect multiple redundant components or exceed network buffering capacity, following quantifiable thresholds; (H3b) Disease-associated mutations preferentially affect genes in robustness networks, and disease severity correlates with disruption of compensation mechanisms; (H3c) Cellular context (cell type, developmental stage, environmental conditions) modulates redundancy networks, making compensation context-dependent and predictable from expression states. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing genetic interaction patterns in disease-associated genes, integrating cancer genomics data to identify robustness network disruptions, examining cell-type-specific genetic interaction screens, and developing machine learning models to predict compensation outcomes. Expected outcomes include a framework for predicting synthetic lethal interactions, identification of disease mechanisms involving robustness network failure, and context-specific robustness maps.

Cross-cutting hypothesis: We hypothesize that integrating genetic interaction networks, expression compensation patterns, protein interaction data, and evolutionary conservation will reveal universal design principles of biological robustness that transcend specific molecular mechanisms. We predict that successful robustness architectures share quantifiable features including modularity, distributed redundancy, regulatory feedback, and evolutionary conservation patterns. Validation will come from: (1) ability to predict genetic interaction outcomes in held-out datasets; (2) identification of conserved robustness principles across organisms; (3) successful prediction of synthetic lethal interactions for therapeutic targeting; (4) explanation of disease mechanisms through robustness network disruption. These hypotheses require synthesis of data types and analytical approaches beyond any single laboratory's capacity, justifying the community-scale synthesis approach.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse public datasets through a phased analytical pipeline combining network analysis, evolutionary genomics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling. The project spans 36 months with quarterly milestones and leverages complementary expertise from genetics, systems biology, evolutionary biology, and computational network theory.

Genetic interaction data will be extracted from BioGRID (>2 million interactions across species), including synthetic lethal, synthetic sick, and suppression interactions from yeast (SGA data), C. elegans, Drosophila, and human cell lines. CRISPR/RNAi screening data will be obtained from DepMap (genome-wide essentiality across 1,000+ cancer cell lines), GenomeRNAi, and published screens. Gene expression compensation datasets will be compiled from GEO, including knockout vs. knockdown comparisons revealing transcriptional compensation, and time-series data capturing compensation dynamics. Protein interaction networks will be integrated from BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct. Evolutionary data including orthology relationships, sequence alignments, and phylogenetic trees will be obtained from Ensembl, OrthoMCL, and TreeFam. Disease association data will be extracted from ClinVar, COSMIC, and OMIM. We will develop standardized data formats, implement quality control filters, and create a unified database with cross-referenced identifiers. This integration phase requires collaboration between bioinformaticians and domain experts to ensure biological validity.

Network Architecture Analysis (Months 4-15): We will apply advanced network analysis methods to identify robustness architectures. Community detection algorithms (Louvain, Infomap, hierarchical clustering) will identify modular redundancy units in genetic interaction networks. For each module, we will calculate topological features including clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, degree distribution, and motif enrichment. We will develop composite robustness scores integrating network topology with genetic interaction strength and phenotypic severity. Machine learning approaches (random forests, gradient boosting) will identify network features predictive of compensation capacity. We will validate predictions using held-out genetic interaction data and cross-species comparisons. Graph neural networks will be trained to predict genetic interactions from network context. This phase involves systems biologists and network theorists developing novel analytical frameworks.

Evolutionary Analysis (Months 7-18): We will reconstruct the evolutionary history of redundancy networks through comparative genomics. Phylogenetic analysis will date gene duplication events and track lineage-specific losses. We will calculate evolutionary rates (dN/dS) for redundant gene pairs and test for selection signatures. Regulatory region conservation will be assessed through alignment of promoters and enhancers. We will correlate evolutionary patterns with genetic interaction strength, testing whether functionally redundant pairs show constrained evolution. Ancestral network reconstruction will reveal how redundancy architectures evolved and rewired across lineages. We will distinguish functional redundancy (maintained by selection) from neutral degeneracy (arising through drift) using population genetics models. This phase requires evolutionary biologists and comparative genomicists working with geneticists to interpret functional significance.

Compensation Mechanism Characterization (Months 10-24): We will systematically analyze compensation mechanisms using expression data. Differential expression analysis will identify genes upregulated following perturbations, revealing transcriptional compensation networks. Time-series analysis will characterize compensation dynamics and identify regulatory circuits. We will integrate transcriptional responses with genetic interaction data to distinguish direct compensation (upregulation of redundant genes) from indirect buffering (pathway rerouting). Regulatory network analysis will identify transcription factors controlling compensation responses. We will develop mathematical models of compensation dynamics using ordinary differential equations, parameterized from expression time-series data. Model simulations will predict compensation capacity and identify conditions where compensation fails. This phase combines genomics expertise with mathematical modeling capabilities.

Context-Dependent Robustness Mapping (Months 16-27): We will analyze how cellular context modulates robustness using cell-type-specific and condition-specific datasets. We will compare genetic interaction patterns across cancer cell lines from DepMap, identifying context-dependent synthetic lethality. Expression-based cell state characterization will enable prediction of active redundancy networks in different contexts. We will integrate disease genomics data to identify robustness network disruptions in patient samples. Machine learning models will predict context-specific compensation capacity from expression profiles. This phase requires integration of cancer genomics expertise with network analysis.

Predictive Model Development and Validation (Months 20-33): We will develop computational tools for predicting genetic interactions and compensation outcomes. Features will include network topology, evolutionary conservation, expression patterns, and protein interactions. We will train ensemble models using cross-validation and test on independent datasets. Model interpretation will reveal key features determining robustness. We will develop user-friendly web tools for querying predictions and visualizing robustness networks. Validation will include comparison with new genetic interaction screens and experimental testing of predictions by collaborators.

Synthesis and Framework Development (Months 28-36): We will synthesize findings into a comprehensive cellular robustness atlas and theoretical framework. We will identify universal design principles of robustness architectures, develop quantitative models of compensation capacity, and create visualization tools for exploring redundancy networks. We will organize workshops bringing together working group members and broader community to refine frameworks and plan follow-up studies.

This synthesis project will integrate cell reprogramming datasets, transdifferentiation studies, chromatin accessibility data, transcription factor binding profiles, and developmental plasticity measurements to identify molecular determinants of cellular plasticity. By uniting developmental biologists, stem cell biologists, epigeneticists, and machine learning experts, we will analyze what makes cells amenable or resistant to fate changes. The project will synthesize data from reprogramming studies (iPSC, direct conversion), developmental lineage restriction data, chromatin remodeling datasets, and natural plasticity examples (regeneration, metaplasia) to address: What molecular features predict plasticity potential? How is plasticity progressively restricted during development? Can plasticity barriers be systematically predicted? We will develop machine learning models to predict reprogramming efficiency from molecular features, identify chromatin and network configurations associated with plasticity, and map plasticity landscapes across cell types. This requires integration of reprogramming data, epigenomics, network analysis, and developmental biology across diverse systems—capabilities spanning multiple disciplines. The synthesis demands comparative analysis of plasticity across contexts and species at scales impossible for individual laboratories. Deliverables include a cellular plasticity atlas scoring cell types by reprogramming potential, predictive tools for identifying plasticity barriers and optimal reprogramming strategies, standardized workflows for plasticity analysis, and training programs in regenerative biology. This resource will enable rational design of cell fate engineering protocols for regenerative medicine.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular plasticity represents one of the most fundamental yet poorly understood properties in biology. The groundbreaking discovery that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka and colleagues revolutionized regenerative medicine and demonstrated that cellular identity is not irreversibly fixed. However, nearly two decades later, we still cannot predict which cells will successfully reprogram, why reprogramming efficiency varies from less than 0.01% to over 50% depending on the starting cell type, or what molecular features determine whether a cell can change its fate. This knowledge gap represents a critical barrier to advancing regenerative medicine, understanding developmental biology, and harnessing cellular plasticity for therapeutic applications.

The current state of cellular plasticity research is characterized by fragmented insights across multiple subdisciplines. Reprogramming studies have identified numerous transcription factor combinations that can induce pluripotency or direct conversion between cell types, yet the success rates remain unpredictable and highly variable. Developmental biology has documented progressive lineage restriction during embryogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this loss of plasticity remain incompletely understood. Epigenetic studies have revealed that chromatin accessibility and histone modifications change during differentiation, creating barriers to fate conversion. However, these observations have not been systematically integrated to create a unified framework for understanding and predicting cellular plasticity.

Recent advances have generated unprecedented volumes of relevant data. Large-scale reprogramming studies have profiled thousands of cells during iPSC generation using single-cell RNA sequencing, revealing heterogeneous trajectories and identifying rare cells that successfully reprogram. Direct transdifferentiation experiments have demonstrated conversion between diverse cell types, from fibroblasts to neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes. Chromatin accessibility atlases now cover hundreds of cell types across developmental stages and species. Transcription factor binding databases contain millions of ChIP-seq profiles. Natural plasticity examples, including salamander limb regeneration, liver regeneration in mammals, and metaplastic transitions in disease, provide evolutionary perspectives on plasticity mechanisms. Despite this data wealth, these resources remain siloed within individual studies and disciplines, preventing comprehensive synthesis.

Several key gaps limit our understanding of cellular plasticity. First, we lack quantitative frameworks to compare plasticity across different contexts—reprogramming to pluripotency versus direct conversion versus developmental potency versus regenerative capacity. Second, the relative contributions of different molecular features (transcription factor networks, chromatin state, metabolic configuration, signaling environment) to plasticity potential remain unclear. Third, we cannot predict a priori which cell types will be amenable to specific fate conversions or what barriers must be overcome. Fourth, the relationship between developmental stage and plasticity loss has not been systematically mapped across cell lineages. Finally, we lack standardized computational tools and analytical frameworks for plasticity analysis that can be applied across studies and systems.

This research is critically important for multiple reasons. Scientifically, understanding plasticity determinants addresses fundamental questions about cell identity maintenance, developmental canalization, and evolutionary constraints on cellular flexibility. Practically, predictive models of cellular plasticity would transform regenerative medicine by enabling rational design of reprogramming protocols, reducing empirical trial-and-error, and identifying optimal starting cell populations for therapeutic applications. The timing is ideal because sufficient high-quality data now exists across multiple modalities and systems to enable meaningful synthesis, machine learning approaches have matured to handle complex multi-modal biological data, and the regenerative medicine field urgently needs more efficient and predictable cell fate engineering strategies.

This synthesis project is uniquely positioned to address these challenges by integrating diverse data types across contexts, species, and scales that no individual laboratory could comprehensively analyze. The transdisciplinary collaboration required—spanning developmental biology, stem cell biology, epigenetics, computational biology, and machine learning—exemplifies the community-scale synthesis approach. By creating a unified plasticity framework, predictive tools, and open resources, this project will catalyze advances across multiple fields while training the next generation of researchers in integrative, data-driven approaches to fundamental biological questions.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance our understanding of cellular plasticity through comprehensive data integration.

Research Question 1: What molecular features quantitatively predict cellular plasticity potential across different contexts? This question seeks to identify the key molecular determinants that make cells amenable or resistant to fate changes. We hypothesize that cellular plasticity is determined by a quantifiable combination of chromatin accessibility at key regulatory regions, transcription factor network architecture, epigenetic modification patterns, and metabolic state. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) cells with higher chromatin accessibility at pluripotency-associated enhancers will show greater reprogramming efficiency; (H1b) transcription factor networks with fewer self-reinforcing feedback loops will exhibit higher plasticity; (H1c) cells with lower DNA methylation at developmental regulatory regions will be more amenable to fate conversion; and (H1d) metabolic configurations favoring glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation will correlate with increased plasticity potential. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate ATAC-seq and DNase-seq chromatin accessibility data with reprogramming efficiency measurements across cell types, correlate transcription factor network topology (derived from ChIP-seq and gene regulatory network databases) with successful fate conversion rates, analyze DNA methylation patterns (WGBS and RRBS data) in relation to transdifferentiation success, and examine metabolic profiling data alongside plasticity measurements. Expected outcomes include quantitative plasticity scores for different cell types based on molecular features, identification of the most predictive molecular markers of plasticity potential, and machine learning models that can predict reprogramming efficiency from multi-omic profiles with validated accuracy exceeding 75%.

Research Question 2: How is cellular plasticity progressively restricted during development, and can we map the molecular transitions that establish lineage commitment? This question addresses the temporal dynamics of plasticity loss during differentiation and development. We hypothesize that plasticity restriction occurs through sequential molecular transitions involving chromatin compaction, establishment of repressive epigenetic marks, and stabilization of cell-type-specific transcription factor networks. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) plasticity decreases in a stepwise manner corresponding to major developmental transitions rather than gradually; (H2b) chromatin accessibility at alternative lineage genes progressively decreases during lineage commitment; (H2c) specific combinations of repressive histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) accumulate at plasticity-associated loci during differentiation; and (H2d) transcription factor network rewiring creates increasingly stable attractor states that resist perturbation. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing time-series data from differentiation protocols spanning embryonic stem cells to terminally differentiated cells, integrating developmental stage-specific chromatin accessibility atlases with plasticity measurements at each stage, correlating histone modification ChIP-seq data across developmental time points with reprogramming efficiency, and applying dynamical systems modeling to gene regulatory networks to identify stability transitions. Expected outcomes include a developmental plasticity timeline mapping when and how plasticity is lost across major lineages, identification of critical molecular transitions that establish commitment points, and predictive models indicating which developmental stages are optimal starting points for specific fate conversions.

Research Question 3: Can plasticity barriers be systematically predicted and categorized to enable rational design of reprogramming strategies? This question aims to create actionable knowledge for overcoming obstacles to cellular fate conversion. We hypothesize that plasticity barriers fall into distinct mechanistic categories (chromatin barriers, transcription factor antagonism, metabolic incompatibility, signaling pathway conflicts) that can be systematically identified and targeted. Our predictions are: (H3a) failed reprogramming attempts share common molecular signatures that distinguish them from successful conversions; (H3b) different cell type conversions encounter distinct barrier types that require specific interventions; (H3c) natural plasticity examples (regeneration, metaplasia) employ conserved molecular strategies to overcome barriers that can inform synthetic approaches; and (H3d) optimal reprogramming factor combinations can be predicted based on the specific barriers present in a given starting cell type. We will test these hypotheses by comparing molecular profiles of cells that fail versus succeed in reprogramming across multiple studies, performing systematic analysis of barrier types across diverse transdifferentiation protocols, integrating data from natural plasticity systems (salamander regeneration, liver regeneration, Barrett's metaplasia) to identify barrier-overcoming mechanisms, and developing recommendation algorithms that suggest optimal reprogramming strategies based on starting cell molecular profiles. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive catalog of plasticity barriers organized by mechanism and cell type context, validated strategies for overcoming specific barrier categories, and a computational tool that recommends optimized reprogramming protocols for user-specified cell type conversions. All hypotheses will be validated through cross-validation approaches, independent dataset testing, and comparison with prospective experimental results from published studies not included in the training data.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse publicly available datasets through a systematic, multi-phase analytical approach combining bioinformatics, machine learning, network analysis, and comparative biology methods.

Data Sources and Integration: We will compile comprehensive datasets spanning multiple data modalities and biological contexts. For reprogramming data, we will aggregate single-cell RNA-seq datasets from iPSC reprogramming studies (>50 datasets from GEO, ArrayExpress, and Single Cell Portal, representing >500,000 cells across mouse, human, and other species), direct transdifferentiation studies documenting conversions between >30 cell type pairs, and reprogramming efficiency measurements from published literature (systematic review of >300 studies). Chromatin accessibility data will include ATAC-seq and DNase-seq profiles from ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and individual studies covering >400 cell types across developmental stages. Epigenetic data will encompass DNA methylation (WGBS/RRBS from ENCODE and GEO, >200 cell types), histone modification ChIP-seq (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 from ENCODE and ChromHMM databases), and chromatin state annotations. Transcription factor binding data will be sourced from ChIP-Atlas, ENCODE, and ReMap databases (>10,000 ChIP-seq experiments). Developmental data will include time-series expression and epigenetic profiles from differentiation protocols, lineage tracing data from developmental atlases, and single-cell developmental trajectories from embryogenesis studies. Natural plasticity data will incorporate regeneration transcriptomics (salamander, zebrafish, mouse liver), metaplasia datasets (Barrett's esophagus, intestinal metaplasia), and cancer dedifferentiation profiles. All datasets will be systematically curated with metadata standardization, quality control filtering, and batch effect assessment.

Phase 1 (Months 1-8): Data Harmonization and Feature Engineering. We will establish standardized processing pipelines for each data type using established tools (Seurat/Scanpy for scRNA-seq, MACS2 for ChIP-seq, Bismark for methylation data) with consistent reference genomes and annotations. We will develop a unified cellular plasticity database integrating all data sources with standardized cell type ontologies (Cell Ontology) and developmental stage annotations (Uberon). Feature engineering will extract quantitative molecular features including chromatin accessibility scores at defined regulatory regions, transcription factor expression and binding patterns, epigenetic modification levels, gene regulatory network topology metrics (centrality, modularity, feedback loop counts), and metabolic pathway activity scores. Cross-species ortholog mapping will enable comparative analyses across model organisms.

Phase 2 (Months 9-16): Plasticity Determinant Identification and Modeling. We will apply multiple analytical approaches to identify plasticity determinants. Differential analysis will compare molecular features between high-plasticity and low-plasticity cell types, successful versus failed reprogramming cells, and across developmental stages. Machine learning models will include random forest classifiers to identify most predictive features, gradient boosting models (XGBoost) for plasticity potential prediction, deep learning approaches (neural networks) for multi-modal data integration, and interpretable models (SHAP values) to understand feature contributions. Gene regulatory network analysis will employ Boolean network modeling, ordinary differential equation models for network dynamics, attractor landscape analysis to identify stable cell states, and perturbation simulations to predict reprogramming trajectories. Comparative genomics will identify conserved plasticity-associated regulatory elements across species and analyze evolutionary patterns in plasticity mechanisms.

Phase 3 (Months 17-24): Barrier Identification and Strategy Optimization. We will systematically categorize plasticity barriers through trajectory analysis of failed reprogramming attempts, identification of molecular roadblocks (inaccessible chromatin, antagonistic transcription factors, metabolic incompatibilities), and comparative analysis with natural plasticity systems that successfully overcome similar barriers. We will develop optimization algorithms that recommend reprogramming factor combinations based on starting cell molecular profiles, predict optimal timing and dosing strategies, and suggest barrier-specific interventions (chromatin remodelers, metabolic modulators, signaling pathway modulators). Validation will employ cross-validation within integrated datasets, testing on held-out independent datasets, and retrospective comparison with published experimental outcomes.

Phase 4 (Months 25-30): Atlas Construction and Tool Development. We will create a comprehensive Cellular Plasticity Atlas with quantitative plasticity scores for >400 cell types, predicted reprogramming efficiencies for cell type pairs, barrier profiles for each cell type, and interactive visualization tools. We will develop open-source computational tools including PlasticityPredictor (machine learning models for plasticity prediction), BarrierAnalyzer (identification of plasticity obstacles), ReprogrammingOptimizer (protocol recommendation system), and standardized analysis workflows with documentation and tutorials.

Phase 5 (Months 31-36): Validation, Refinement, and Dissemination. We will validate predictions through comparison with newly published studies, community feedback and testing, and iterative model refinement. Training programs will include workshops on plasticity analysis methods, online tutorials and documentation, and mentorship of graduate students and postdocs in integrative approaches.

Statistical Analysis: All analyses will employ rigorous statistical methods including multiple testing correction (FDR), appropriate effect size calculations, confidence interval estimation, and sensitivity analyses. Model performance will be assessed using cross-validation, precision-recall metrics, ROC curves, and calibration plots. All code, workflows, and intermediate results will be version-controlled and publicly released following open science principles.

This atlas will provide plasticity scores derived from integrated multi-omic features, predicted reprogramming efficiencies for thousands of cell type conversion pairs, molecular barrier profiles identifying obstacles to fate conversion for each cell type, and developmental plasticity trajectories showing how plasticity changes during lineage commitment. This resource will fundamentally advance our understanding of cell identity stability and flexibility, providing a reference framework that will be cited and utilized across developmental biology, stem cell research, and regenerative medicine fields for years to come. The predictive computational tools—PlasticityPredictor, BarrierAnalyzer, and ReprogrammingOptimizer—will enable researchers to rationally design cell fate engineering experiments rather than relying on empirical trial-and-error, potentially accelerating regenerative medicine applications by years and reducing resource waste from failed reprogramming attempts. These tools will be implemented as user-friendly web interfaces and command-line applications with comprehensive documentation, ensuring accessibility to researchers without computational expertise.

Mechanistic Insights and Theoretical Advances: The project will resolve long-standing questions about cellular plasticity mechanisms by quantitatively determining the relative contributions of chromatin accessibility, transcription factor networks, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic state to plasticity potential. We will establish whether plasticity restriction during development occurs gradually or through discrete transitions, with implications for understanding developmental canalization and evolutionary constraints on cellular flexibility. The systematic categorization of plasticity barriers will create a mechanistic framework for understanding why some cell conversions succeed while others fail, potentially revealing universal principles of cell state stability. Comparative analysis across species will identify conserved versus lineage-specific plasticity mechanisms, informing evolutionary biology and suggesting which model organisms best represent human cellular plasticity for translational research.

Broader Impacts and Applications: The regenerative medicine field will benefit immediately from tools that predict optimal starting cell types for therapeutic applications, recommend efficient reprogramming protocols, and identify patient-specific barriers to cell therapy success. Cancer biology will gain insights from plasticity mechanisms relevant to tumor dedifferentiation, metaplastic transitions, and therapy resistance. Developmental biology will acquire quantitative frameworks for studying lineage commitment and cell fate decisions. The agricultural biotechnology sector could apply plasticity principles to plant cell reprogramming for crop improvement. The standardized analytical workflows will establish best practices for plasticity research, improving reproducibility and enabling meta-analyses across studies. Training programs will educate 15-20 graduate students and postdocs in integrative, data-driven approaches, creating a cohort of researchers skilled in synthesis science who will propagate these approaches throughout their careers.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: We will pursue a multi-tiered publication strategy including high-impact primary research articles in journals such as Cell, Nature, Science, or Cell Stem Cell presenting the integrated plasticity atlas and predictive models; methods papers in Nature Methods or Genome Biology describing computational tools and analytical workflows; perspective articles synthesizing insights about plasticity mechanisms and implications for regenerative medicine; and discipline-specific papers targeting developmental biology, epigenetics, and computational biology audiences. All publications will be open access to maximize accessibility. The Cellular Plasticity Atlas and computational tools will be hosted on dedicated websites with permanent DOIs, deposited in established repositories (GitHub for code, Zenodo for data), and integrated with existing resources like the Human Cell Atlas and ENCODE portals. We will present findings at major conferences (International Society for Stem Cell Research, Society for Developmental Biology, RECOMB) and organize dedicated workshops to train the community in using our resources.

Follow-up Research and Sustainability: This project will catalyze numerous follow-up investigations including experimental validation of predicted plasticity barriers and reprogramming strategies, application of plasticity principles to in vivo regeneration and tissue engineering, extension to disease contexts (cancer, fibrosis, neurodegeneration), and development of next-generation predictive models incorporating additional data modalities (proteomics, metabolomics, single-cell multiomics). We will establish a Plasticity Research Consortium bringing together computational and experimental laboratories to iteratively refine predictions through experimental testing, creating a sustainable feedback loop between prediction and validation. The computational infrastructure will be designed for continuous updates as new datasets become available, ensuring long-term relevance. We will pursue additional funding for experimental validation studies and tool enhancement, establishing this synthesis project as the foundation for an ongoing research program. The training component will create a self-sustaining community of practice in plasticity synthesis research, with trainees becoming future leaders who continue advancing this field. Ultimately, this project will establish cellular plasticity as a quantitative, predictable property rather than an empirical observation, fundamentally transforming how we understand and manipulate cell fate for scientific and therapeutic purposes.

This synthesis project will integrate time-resolved proteomics and phosphoproteomics from synchronized cells, live-cell imaging datasets, protein localization dynamics, and perturbation studies to decode the molecular choreography of cell division. By bringing together cell cycle biologists, systems biologists, biophysicists, and computational modelers, we will analyze temporal and spatial coordination of division events to identify regulatory principles and coordination mechanisms.

What mechanisms ensure spatial coordination? How does coordination vary across cell types? We will develop spatiotemporal models of division progression, apply causal inference to identify coordination dependencies, and use comparative approaches to distinguish conserved versus cell-type-specific mechanisms. This addresses fundamental questions about biological coordination that require integration of temporal proteomics, spatial imaging, perturbation data, and mathematical modeling—expertise rarely combined in single laboratories. The synthesis demands analysis across molecular layers, division stages, and cell types at unprecedented resolution.

This work will reveal coordination principles and identify vulnerabilities for cancer therapeutics.",,"Background And Significance

Cell division represents one of the most fundamental and precisely orchestrated processes in biology, requiring the coordinated execution of thousands of molecular events across multiple spatial and temporal scales. From DNA replication and chromosome condensation to spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis, each stage must occur in proper sequence and spatial organization to ensure faithful transmission of genetic material. Errors in this coordination lead to aneuploidy, genomic instability, and diseases including cancer, making understanding of division coordination mechanisms both fundamentally important and clinically relevant.

Over the past two decades, technological advances have generated unprecedented molecular and cellular data on cell division. Time-resolved mass spectrometry studies have catalogued dynamic changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle, revealing waves of post-translational modifications that drive division progression. Live-cell imaging has captured the spatiotemporal dynamics of hundreds of division proteins with subcellular resolution. High-throughput perturbation screens have identified genes essential for division and revealed functional dependencies. Structural studies have elucidated molecular mechanisms of key division machines. Yet despite this wealth of data, fundamental questions about coordination mechanisms remain unanswered because these datasets have been generated by different laboratories using different model systems, analyzed in isolation, and rarely integrated across molecular layers or spatial scales.

Current understanding of division coordination centers on several regulatory systems. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) network drives temporal progression through phosphorylation of hundreds of substrates in ordered waves. The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures chromosomes are properly attached before anaphase. Spatial cues from centrosomes, chromosomes, and the cell cortex organize division structures. However, critical gaps remain in our knowledge. We lack comprehensive maps of temporal dependencies between division events. The mechanisms ensuring spatial coordination between distant cellular locations are poorly understood. How coordination mechanisms vary across cell types with different division modes remains largely unexplored. Most importantly, we lack integrative frameworks that connect molecular changes (proteomics, phosphoproteomics) with spatial organization (imaging, localization) and functional outcomes (perturbation phenotypes).

Several factors make this an ideal time for synthesis research on division coordination. First, massive publicly available datasets now exist across multiple model systems. The Cell Cycle Database, MitoCheck, and other resources contain time-lapse imaging of thousands of division events. Proteomics repositories house temporal profiles from synchronized cells across species. Localization databases map subcellular distributions of division proteins. Perturbation databases catalogue phenotypes from systematic screens. Second, computational methods for integrating heterogeneous biological data have matured, including causal inference algorithms, spatiotemporal modeling frameworks, and machine learning approaches for pattern recognition. Third, the field recognizes that understanding biological coordination requires synthesis across data types and expertise domains—a challenge beyond individual laboratories.

This synthesis project addresses a fundamental question in molecular and cellular biology: How do cells coordinate complex multi-scale processes? Cell division provides an ideal model system because it is highly conserved, extensively studied, and clinically important. By integrating temporal molecular data, spatial imaging data, and perturbation data across model systems, we can identify coordination principles that may apply broadly to other biological processes. The comparative approach across yeast, Drosophila, and human cells will distinguish universal coordination mechanisms from cell-type-specific adaptations, revealing both conserved principles and evolutionary innovations.

The significance extends beyond basic biology. Cancer cells exhibit altered division coordination, and many successful cancer therapeutics target division machinery. Understanding coordination mechanisms and identifying critical dependencies could reveal new therapeutic vulnerabilities. The analytical tools and modeling frameworks developed will be applicable to other coordination problems in cell biology. The interdisciplinary training program will prepare the next generation of researchers to tackle complex biological questions through data synthesis. This project exemplifies the community-scale synthesis approach: it requires integration of diverse public datasets, demands collaboration across disciplines, and addresses questions beyond the scope of individual laboratories.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will advance understanding of cell division coordination mechanisms.

Research Question 1: How are division events temporally ordered, and what mechanisms establish temporal dependencies? Cell division progresses through discrete stages, but the molecular mechanisms ensuring proper temporal ordering remain incompletely understood. We hypothesize that temporal coordination operates through hierarchical regulatory networks with multiple layers: (H1a) CDK-cyclin complexes establish a primary temporal axis through ordered substrate phosphorylation, creating temporal waves of activity; (H1b) Feedback loops and checkpoint mechanisms create temporal dependencies between events, ensuring completion of earlier events before later ones proceed; (H1c) Protein degradation by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) creates irreversible temporal transitions. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate time-resolved phosphoproteomics data showing temporal patterns of phosphorylation with protein abundance data revealing degradation dynamics. We predict that causal inference analysis will identify directed dependencies between phosphorylation events, revealing the temporal ordering logic. We expect to find that certain phosphorylation events consistently precede others across cell types, defining conserved temporal checkpoints. Perturbation data will validate predicted dependencies: disrupting earlier events should delay or prevent later events in predicted patterns. Expected outcomes include temporal ordering maps for major division events, identification of rate-limiting steps that control division timing, and quantitative models predicting how perturbations affect temporal progression.

Research Question 2: What mechanisms ensure spatial coordination between distant cellular locations during division? Cell division requires precise spatial organization: centrosomes must separate and position spindle poles, chromosomes must align at the metaphase plate, and the cleavage furrow must form at the correct location. We hypothesize that spatial coordination operates through multiple mechanisms: (H2a) Diffusible gradients emanating from organizing centers (centrosomes, chromosomes, spindle midzone) provide spatial information; (H2b) Motor proteins and cytoskeletal networks create long-range mechanical connections; (H2c) Geometric constraints and cell shape influence spatial organization. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing protein localization dynamics from live-cell imaging databases, correlating spatial patterns with cell geometry and division outcomes. We predict that proteins involved in spatial coordination will show characteristic localization patterns: gradient distributions, enrichment at specific structures, or dynamic relocalization between division stages. Perturbation data will reveal functional requirements: disrupting gradient sources, motor proteins, or cytoskeletal elements should cause specific spatial coordination defects. Computational modeling will test whether observed spatial patterns can be explained by diffusion-reaction mechanisms, active transport, or geometric constraints. Expected outcomes include spatial coordination maps showing how proteins organize relative to division structures, identification of spatial cues that guide division organization, and predictive models for spatial pattern formation.

Research Question 3: How does coordination vary across cell types, and what mechanisms account for differences? Different cell types exhibit distinct division modes: symmetric versus asymmetric division, open versus closed mitosis, and variations in spindle positioning and orientation. We hypothesize that: (H3a) Core coordination mechanisms are conserved across eukaryotes, but cell-type-specific regulators modulate timing and spatial organization; (H3b) Cell size, shape, and mechanical properties influence coordination requirements; (H3c) Developmental context and differentiation state alter coordination through cell-type-specific gene expression. We will test these hypotheses through comparative analysis of division data from budding yeast (small cells, closed mitosis), Drosophila S2 cells (intermediate size, open mitosis), and human cells (large cells, diverse types). We predict that temporal ordering of core events (DNA replication, chromosome segregation, cytokinesis) will be conserved, but timing intervals will vary with cell size. Spatial coordination mechanisms will show both conserved features (spindle assembly principles) and cell-type-specific adaptations (spindle positioning mechanisms). Phylogenetic analysis of division proteins will identify conserved core machinery versus lineage-specific regulators. Expected outcomes include identification of universal coordination principles, characterization of cell-type-specific adaptations, and understanding of how evolution has modified division coordination.

Cross-cutting hypothesis: We hypothesize that division coordination emerges from integration of multiple regulatory layers—transcriptional programs establishing division competence, post-translational modifications driving temporal progression, spatial cues organizing structures, and checkpoints ensuring fidelity. We predict that successful coordination requires redundancy and robustness: multiple mechanisms ensure critical events occur properly, and perturbations are buffered by compensatory pathways. This will be tested by analyzing how cells respond to perturbations in integrated datasets, identifying compensatory mechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Expected deliverables include a comprehensive cell division choreography atlas, predictive computational models, open-source analytical tools, and training resources for the community.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse publicly available datasets through a systematic, multi-phase approach combining data harmonization, integrative analysis, computational modeling, and comparative synthesis.

Phase 1: Data Identification, Curation, and Harmonization (Months 1-6). We will systematically identify and curate publicly available datasets across four categories: (1) Temporal molecular data: Time-resolved proteomics and phosphoproteomics from synchronized cell populations, including datasets from Olsen et al. (human cell cycle phosphoproteomics, >10,000 phosphorylation sites), Ly et al. (mitotic proteome dynamics), and comparable datasets from yeast and Drosophila available through PRIDE and ProteomeXchange repositories. (2) Spatial imaging data: Live-cell imaging datasets including the MitoCheck database (>190,000 time-lapse movies of human cell division), the Yeast GFP Fusion Localization Database, and Drosophila protein localization data from FlyBase. (3) Perturbation data: Systematic RNAi and CRISPR screens including GenomeRNAi, DepMap, and published mitotic phenotype databases cataloguing division defects. (4) Structural and interaction data: Protein-protein interaction networks from BioGRID and IntAct, structural data from PDB, and domain information from Pfam. Data harmonization will involve standardizing temporal references (aligning to common division landmarks), spatial coordinates (registering to common cellular reference frames), and molecular identifiers (mapping to orthologous proteins across species). We will implement quality control pipelines to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and batch effects. All curated datasets will be deposited in a public repository with standardized metadata following FAIR principles.

Phase 2: Temporal Coordination Analysis (Months 4-12). We will analyze temporal ordering and dependencies using multiple complementary approaches. Dynamic time warping will align temporal profiles across experiments and cell types, accounting for differences in division timing. Change-point detection algorithms will identify discrete temporal transitions in molecular profiles. Causal inference methods, including Granger causality and convergent cross-mapping, will infer directed dependencies between molecular events from time-series data. We will construct temporal ordering networks where nodes represent division events and edges represent temporal dependencies. Network analysis will identify critical ordering constraints, rate-limiting steps, and parallel versus sequential pathways. Machine learning models (random forests, neural networks) will be trained to predict division timing and progression from molecular profiles, with cross-validation across datasets. Perturbation data will validate predicted dependencies: we will test whether disrupting earlier events affects later events as predicted by the temporal ordering network. Statistical significance will be assessed through permutation testing and bootstrap confidence intervals.

Phase 3: Spatial Coordination Analysis (Months 7-18). Spatial analysis will integrate protein localization dynamics with cell geometry and division outcomes. We will develop image analysis pipelines to extract quantitative features from live-cell imaging: protein localization patterns, organelle positions, cell shape, and division timing. Spatial correlation analysis will identify proteins with coordinated localization patterns. We will apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to identify major spatial patterns and cluster proteins by localization behavior. Spatiotemporal modeling will test mechanistic hypotheses: reaction-diffusion models for gradient formation, agent-based models for motor-driven transport, and geometric models for spatial pattern formation. Model parameters will be constrained by experimental measurements (diffusion coefficients, protein concentrations, motor velocities from literature). Model predictions will be validated against observed localization patterns and perturbation phenotypes. We will use Bayesian inference to estimate model parameters and quantify uncertainty. Spatial coordination maps will visualize how proteins organize relative to division structures across time.

Phase 4: Integrative Multi-Scale Modeling (Months 13-24). We will develop integrative computational models connecting molecular changes to spatial organization and functional outcomes. Multi-layer network models will integrate protein interaction networks, phosphorylation networks, and localization dependencies. Boolean network models will simulate division progression, incorporating temporal ordering constraints and checkpoint logic. Ordinary differential equation models will capture quantitative dynamics of key regulatory circuits. Agent-based models will simulate spatial organization of division structures. Model validation will involve comparing simulations to experimental data across multiple readouts: temporal profiles, spatial patterns, and perturbation phenotypes. Sensitivity analysis will identify critical parameters and robust features. We will use the models to generate predictions for untested perturbations, which can guide future experimental studies. Model code will be released as open-source software with documentation.

Phase 5: Comparative Analysis Across Cell Types (Months 19-30). Comparative analysis will identify conserved versus cell-type-specific coordination mechanisms. We will align division events across yeast, Drosophila, and human cells using orthologous proteins and conserved landmarks. Phylogenetic analysis will trace evolution of division proteins and identify lineage-specific innovations. Statistical comparisons will test whether temporal ordering, spatial patterns, and coordination mechanisms differ significantly between cell types. We will identify core coordination modules present across species and cell-type-specific regulatory layers. Machine learning classifiers will predict cell-type-specific features from molecular profiles.

Phase 6: Atlas Development and Tool Dissemination (Months 25-36). We will create a comprehensive Cell Division Choreography Atlas as an interactive web resource, visualizing spatiotemporal coordination across division stages and cell types. The atlas will include temporal ordering networks, spatial coordination maps, predictive models, and integrated datasets. We will develop open-source software tools for analyzing coordination mechanisms, including pipelines for temporal alignment, causal inference, and spatiotemporal modeling. Extensive documentation, tutorials, and example datasets will facilitate community adoption. All outputs will be released under open licenses.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1: Data curation complete (Month 6), temporal analysis complete (Month 12). Year 2: Spatial analysis complete (Month 18), integrative models developed (Month 24). Year 3: Comparative analysis complete (Month 30), atlas and tools released (Month 36). Quarterly working group meetings will coordinate activities, and annual workshops will engage the broader community.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

Primary Scientific Outcomes: The Cell Division Choreography Atlas will provide the first comprehensive, integrated view of spatiotemporal coordination across division stages and cell types. This resource will map temporal dependencies between thousands of molecular events, revealing the hierarchical logic of division progression. Spatial coordination maps will show how proteins organize relative to division structures with unprecedented resolution. The atlas will be publicly accessible through an interactive web interface, allowing researchers to explore coordination mechanisms, query specific proteins or events, and download integrated datasets. This resource will serve as a reference for the cell division community and a model for synthesis projects in other biological domains.

Predictive computational models will enable quantitative understanding of division coordination. Temporal ordering models will predict how perturbations affect division timing and progression. Spatial models will predict protein localization patterns and spatial organization under different conditions.

The modeling frameworks developed will be applicable to other coordination problems in cell biology, including development, differentiation, and tissue organization.

Comparative analysis across yeast, Drosophila, and human cells will reveal universal coordination principles and cell-type-specific adaptations. We will identify core coordination modules conserved across eukaryotes, representing fundamental solutions to the division coordination problem. Cell-type-specific mechanisms will reveal how evolution has adapted division coordination to different cellular contexts. This evolutionary perspective will provide insights into the origins of division diversity and constraints on division evolution. The comparative framework will be applicable to other conserved cellular processes.

Methodological Innovations: This project will advance synthesis research methods through development of novel analytical approaches. Integration of temporal molecular data with spatial imaging data requires new computational methods for multi-modal data fusion. Causal inference from observational time-series data in complex biological systems remains challenging; our approaches will advance this methodology. Spatiotemporal modeling frameworks connecting molecular networks to spatial organization will be broadly applicable. The data harmonization pipelines and quality control methods will serve as templates for other synthesis projects.

This synthesis project will integrate sensor protein databases, dose-response datasets from environmental perturbations, signaling dynamics measurements, and adaptation studies to decode cellular sensing mechanisms. By assembling sensory biologists, biophysicists, systems biologists, and control engineers, we will analyze how cells detect, quantify, and adapt to environmental changes across sensing modalities. The project will synthesize data from environmental response studies, receptor characterization datasets, dose-response curves from thousands of conditions, and adaptation dynamics measurements across bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells to address: What molecular mechanisms enable parameter measurement? How do cells achieve sensing specificity and sensitivity? What determines dynamic range and adaptation? We will apply signal processing theory to analyze sensing properties, develop biophysical models of sensor mechanisms, and identify design principles of cellular measurement systems. This requires integration of receptor biology, quantitative dose-response data, signaling dynamics, and engineering principles—capabilities spanning multiple disciplines. The synthesis demands comparative analysis across sensing modalities and organisms at scales beyond individual laboratories. Deliverables include a cellular sensing atlas cataloging sensor mechanisms and properties, predictive models for sensing responses, frameworks for analyzing measurement systems, and interdisciplinary training programs bridging biology and engineering. This work will reveal fundamental principles of biological sensing and enable design of engineered biosensors.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular sensing represents one of the most fundamental capabilities of living systems, enabling organisms from bacteria to humans to detect and respond appropriately to environmental changes. Despite decades of research identifying individual sensory receptors and signaling pathways, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that enable cells to accurately measure environmental parameters and convert them into appropriate biological responses. This knowledge gap is particularly striking given the explosion of publicly available data on receptor structures, dose-response relationships, signaling dynamics, and cellular adaptations across diverse organisms and sensing modalities.

The field of cellular sensing has evolved through distinct phases. Early work focused on identifying individual receptors and their ligands, establishing the molecular basis of chemoreception, mechanosensation, and other sensory modalities. Landmark discoveries include bacterial chemotaxis receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels responding to mechanical forces, and transcription factors sensing metabolic states. More recently, systems-level approaches have characterized signaling networks downstream of receptors, revealing complex regulatory architectures involving feedback loops, crosstalk, and adaptation mechanisms. High-throughput technologies have generated vast datasets on cellular responses to environmental perturbations, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles under thousands of conditions. Structural biology has provided atomic-resolution views of sensor proteins in different conformational states. Time-resolved measurements have captured the dynamics of signaling responses, revealing temporal patterns of activation, adaptation, and desensitization.

Despite these advances, several critical gaps remain. First, we lack systematic frameworks for comparing sensing mechanisms across different modalities and organisms. Studies typically focus on individual systems in isolation, making it difficult to identify universal principles versus system-specific adaptations. Second, the relationship between molecular sensor properties (binding affinity, conformational changes, oligomerization states) and systems-level sensing characteristics (sensitivity, dynamic range, adaptation kinetics) remains poorly understood. Third, we have limited ability to predict cellular responses to novel environmental conditions based on known sensor properties. Fourth, the design principles that enable cells to achieve remarkable sensing performance—detecting signals across orders of magnitude concentration ranges, discriminating between similar stimuli, and adapting to persistent stimuli while remaining responsive to changes—have not been systematically characterized.

These gaps are particularly significant because cellular sensing underlies virtually all biological processes. Metabolic regulation depends on nutrient sensing, development requires morphogen gradient detection, immune responses rely on pathogen recognition, and disease states often involve aberrant sensing. Understanding sensing mechanisms has direct applications in synthetic biology, where engineered biosensors are needed for diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and metabolic engineering. Moreover, many drugs target sensory receptors, making predictive models of sensing responses valuable for pharmacology.

The time is now ideal for a comprehensive synthesis project on cellular sensing for several reasons. First, massive public datasets are available spanning receptor structures (PDB, AlphaFold), dose-response measurements (LINCS, CCLE, expression databases), signaling dynamics (time-series transcriptomics and proteomics), and adaptation studies across model organisms. Second, computational tools for analyzing these diverse data types have matured, including machine learning methods for pattern recognition, biophysical modeling frameworks, and network analysis algorithms. Third, engineering disciplines have developed sophisticated theories of measurement and control systems that can be applied to biological sensing. Fourth, the synthetic biology community has created standardized parts and characterized biosensors, providing validation datasets for predictive models.

This synthesis project addresses a fundamental question in molecular and cellular biology that requires integration of data and expertise beyond any single laboratory's capabilities. It demands collaboration between sensory biologists who understand receptor mechanisms, biophysicists who can model molecular processes, systems biologists who analyze network-level responses, and control engineers who bring theoretical frameworks for measurement systems. The scale of data integration—spanning multiple sensing modalities, organisms, and experimental approaches—necessitates community-level effort. The project will establish new paradigms for understanding biological sensing and create resources enabling future discoveries in this foundational area of cell biology.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes.

Research Question 1: What molecular mechanisms enable cells to measure environmental parameters quantitatively? This question focuses on understanding how molecular-level sensor properties translate into cellular measurement capabilities. We hypothesize that cells employ distinct molecular strategies for measuring different parameter types: (H1a) Concentration-based parameters (nutrients, signaling molecules) are measured through equilibrium binding mechanisms where receptor occupancy reflects ligand concentration; (H1b) Physical parameters (mechanical forces, osmotic pressure) are measured through conformational changes in mechanosensitive proteins; (H1c) Temporal parameters (circadian rhythms, cell cycle timing) are measured through biochemical oscillators with specific period-determining reactions. We predict that systematic analysis of sensor protein structures, binding kinetics, and conformational dynamics across sensing modalities will reveal distinct molecular architectures corresponding to these measurement strategies. Testing will involve integrating structural data from PDB and AlphaFold with functional characterization data from receptor databases, correlating molecular properties with measured sensing characteristics. We expect to identify molecular signatures (binding site architectures, domain organizations, post-translational modification patterns) that predict measurement mechanisms.

Research Question 2: How do cells achieve sensing specificity and sensitivity across diverse environmental conditions? This question addresses the paradox that cells must discriminate between similar stimuli while detecting signals across wide concentration ranges. We hypothesize that specificity and sensitivity are achieved through complementary mechanisms: (H2a) Specificity emerges from combinatorial receptor coding where multiple receptors with overlapping specificities collectively encode stimulus identity; (H2b) Sensitivity is enhanced through signal amplification cascades with specific architectural features (positive feedback, ultrasensitive switches); (H2c) Dynamic range is extended through receptor heterogeneity, where multiple receptor variants with different affinities cover different concentration ranges. We predict that cells sensing chemically similar compounds will show characteristic patterns of receptor expression and cross-reactivity, that highly sensitive pathways will exhibit specific network motifs, and that cells responding across wide dynamic ranges will express receptor families with systematically varying affinities. Testing involves analyzing dose-response datasets from LINCS, CCLE, and environmental perturbation studies, correlating response characteristics with receptor expression profiles and network architectures. We will apply information theory to quantify how much information about environmental states is encoded in cellular responses, and use machine learning to identify molecular and network features predicting sensing performance.

Research Question 3: What determines adaptation dynamics and the ability to detect changes versus absolute levels? This question focuses on temporal aspects of sensing, particularly how cells adapt to persistent stimuli while remaining responsive to changes. We hypothesize that adaptation mechanisms follow design principles from control theory: (H3a) Perfect adaptation (return to baseline despite persistent stimulus) requires integral feedback control, implemented through specific biochemical network motifs; (H3b) Adaptation kinetics are determined by the timescales of feedback processes, with faster feedback producing faster adaptation; (H3c) The ability to sense temporal derivatives (rate of change) versus absolute levels depends on the presence of incoherent feedforward loops that compute differences between current and recent past states. We predict that pathways showing perfect adaptation will contain identifiable integral control motifs, that adaptation timescales will correlate with measured feedback kinetics, and that derivative-sensing systems will show characteristic network architectures. Testing involves analyzing time-series data from adaptation experiments across bacterial chemotaxis, yeast osmotic stress response, and mammalian growth factor signaling, fitting dynamical models to extract kinetic parameters, and correlating network structures with adaptation properties.

Cross-cutting hypothesis: We hypothesize that fundamental sensing principles are conserved across organisms and modalities, with variations reflecting specific environmental challenges and evolutionary constraints. We predict that dimensionality reduction of sensing properties across all systems will reveal a low-dimensional space of sensing strategies, with specific regions occupied by different organism types and sensing modalities. This will be tested through comparative analysis of all integrated datasets, using clustering and classification approaches to identify conserved versus variable features.

Expected outcomes include: (1) A quantitative framework relating molecular sensor properties to systems-level sensing characteristics; (2) Predictive models for cellular responses to environmental perturbations based on receptor properties and network architectures; (3) A catalog of sensing mechanisms and their performance characteristics; (4) Design principles for engineering biosensors with specified properties; (5) Identification of evolutionary constraints and optimization trade-offs in sensing systems. Validation will involve comparing predictions against held-out datasets and, where possible, against published experimental results not included in the training data. Success criteria include prediction accuracy exceeding 70% for response classifications and correlation coefficients above 0.6 for quantitative predictions.

Methods And Approach

This synthesis project will integrate diverse publicly available datasets through a systematic, multi-phase approach combining data mining, biophysical modeling, network analysis, and control theory.

Data Sources and Integration (Months 1-6): We will compile comprehensive datasets spanning: (1) Sensor protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (>180,000 structures) and AlphaFold database (>200 million predictions), focusing on receptors, ion channels, transcription factors, and kinases with known sensory functions; (2) Receptor characterization data from UniProt, IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology, and specialized databases (e.g., TCDB for transporters, Channelpedia for ion channels) including binding affinities, ligand specificities, and functional annotations; (3) Dose-response datasets from LINCS L1000 (>1 million expression profiles across perturbations), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Gene Expression Omnibus (focusing on environmental stress responses), and published dose-response curves from systematic studies; (4) Signaling dynamics data from time-series transcriptomics and proteomics studies in GEO, PRIDE, and MetaboLights, emphasizing temporal responses to environmental changes; (5) Adaptation studies from bacterial chemotaxis databases, yeast stress response datasets, and mammalian signaling studies documenting long-term responses. Data will be standardized using common ontologies (Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) and stored in a unified database with metadata tracking organism, sensing modality, experimental conditions, and measurement types. Quality control will filter datasets based on experimental design, replication, and documentation standards.

Comparative Analysis of Sensing Mechanisms (Months 4-12): We will systematically characterize sensing properties across modalities and organisms. For each sensing system, we will extract: molecular features (sensor structure, binding sites, conformational changes), dose-response characteristics (EC50, Hill coefficients, dynamic range), temporal dynamics (response time, adaptation kinetics), and specificity profiles (ligand selectivity, cross-reactivity). Machine learning approaches (random forests, neural networks) will identify molecular features predicting sensing properties. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) will map sensing systems into low-dimensional spaces revealing relationships between mechanisms. Phylogenetic comparative methods will distinguish conserved principles from lineage-specific adaptations. Clustering algorithms will group systems with similar properties, testing whether clusters correspond to functional categories or evolutionary relationships.

Biophysical Modeling (Months 6-18): We will develop mechanistic models linking molecular properties to sensing characteristics. For equilibrium binding sensors, we will construct thermodynamic models relating binding affinities and cooperativity to dose-response curves. For kinetic sensors, we will build differential equation models of conformational dynamics and downstream signaling. Models will be parameterized using structural data (binding site geometries, conformational changes) and kinetic measurements (association/dissociation rates, enzymatic activities). We will implement models in standardized formats (SBML) and simulate responses to environmental perturbations, comparing predictions with experimental dose-response data. Parameter sensitivity analysis will identify which molecular properties most strongly influence sensing characteristics. Model selection approaches will determine minimal mechanisms sufficient to explain observed behaviors.

Network Analysis and Signal Processing (Months 12-24): We will analyze signaling networks downstream of sensors using graph theory and control theory. Network motifs (feedback loops, feedforward loops, bifans) will be identified and their frequencies compared with random networks. Dynamical models of network motifs will predict their contributions to sensing properties (amplification, adaptation, filtering). We will apply signal processing theory to analyze how networks transform input signals, calculating transfer functions, frequency responses, and noise filtering properties. Information theory will quantify information transmission from environmental signals through sensing networks to cellular responses. Control theory will identify feedback structures enabling specific sensing behaviors (integral control for perfect adaptation, derivative control for change detection).

Comparative Evolutionary Analysis (Months 18-30): We will trace the evolution of sensing mechanisms across phylogeny. Orthologous sensors will be identified across species, and their properties compared to detect evolutionary changes. We will test whether sensing properties show signatures of optimization for specific environmental niches. Horizontal gene transfer events will be identified to understand how sensing capabilities spread between lineages. Ancestral sequence reconstruction will infer properties of ancient sensors, testing hypotheses about evolutionary trajectories.

Integration and Synthesis (Months 24-36): We will integrate findings across all analyses to develop unified frameworks. A cellular sensing atlas will catalog mechanisms, properties, and design principles. Predictive models will be trained on integrated datasets and validated through cross-validation and testing on independent data. We will develop software tools for analyzing new sensing systems and predicting their properties. Design principles will be formalized as quantitative relationships and engineering guidelines.

Timeline and Milestones: Year 1: Complete data integration (Month 6), initial comparative analysis (Month 12); Year 2: Complete biophysical modeling (Month 18), network analysis (Month 24); Year 3: Complete evolutionary analysis (Month 30), final integration and atlas release (Month 36). Quarterly meetings will assess progress and adjust approaches. Annual workshops will engage broader community and gather feedback.

Computational Infrastructure: Analyses will use high-performance computing resources for large-scale simulations and machine learning. Code will be version-controlled (GitHub), documented, and released as open-source packages. Workflows will be implemented in reproducible formats (Jupyter notebooks, Snakemake pipelines) enabling others to replicate and extend analyses.

Validation Strategy: Predictions will be validated against held-out datasets not used in model training. Where possible, we will compare predictions with recent experimental results published after data collection. Sensitivity analyses will assess robustness to data quality and modeling assumptions. Community feedback through workshops will provide expert validation of biological interpretations.

ai_generate_diverse_ideas_claude_10,ai,generate_diverse_ideas,claude-sonnet-4-5,The Molecular Basis of Cellular Cooperation and Competition: Synthesizing Cell-Cell Interaction Networks,"Cells engage in complex cooperative and competitive interactions that shape tissue organization and function, yet systematic understanding of molecular mechanisms governing cell-cell interactions remains limited. This synthesis project will integrate cell-cell communication databases (ligand-receptor pairs), spatial transcriptomics revealing interaction neighborhoods, competition assay datasets, cooperation measurements (metabolic cross-feeding, paracrine signaling), and evolutionary game theory models to decode principles of cellular social behavior. By uniting cell biologists, evolutionary biologists, systems biologists, and theoretical ecologists, we will analyze molecular mechanisms and evolutionary logic of cell-cell interactions. The project will synthesize data from CellPhoneDB, spatial omics studies, cancer competition experiments, microbial cooperation datasets, and developmental interaction studies to address: What molecular mechanisms mediate cooperation versus competition? How do interaction strategies evolve? What determines interaction outcomes in mixed populations? We will apply game theory to model interaction dynamics, use spatial analysis to identify interaction neighborhoods and outcomes, and employ comparative approaches to understand interaction evolution. This addresses fundamental questions about multicellularity and social evolution that require integration of molecular interaction data, spatial context, population dynamics, and evolutionary theory—expertise rarely combined. The synthesis demands analysis across interaction types, spatial scales, and evolutionary contexts beyond single-lab capabilities. Outputs include a cell-cell interaction atlas mapping molecular mechanisms and outcomes, models predicting interaction dynamics, tools for analyzing spatial interaction data, and interdisciplinary training programs. This work will reveal principles of cellular social behavior relevant to development, cancer, and microbial communities.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular interactions form the foundation of multicellular life, orchestrating processes from embryonic development to tissue homeostasis and disease progression. Despite decades of research identifying individual molecular players in cell-cell communication, we lack a comprehensive framework for understanding how cells collectively decide between cooperation and competition, and how these decisions shape biological outcomes. This knowledge gap represents a fundamental limitation in our understanding of multicellularity itself and has profound implications for cancer biology, regenerative medicine, and microbial ecology.

Recent technological advances have generated unprecedented volumes of data on cell-cell interactions. Single-cell RNA sequencing has catalogued cellular heterogeneity across tissues and organisms, while spatial transcriptomics now reveals the spatial organization of these diverse cell types. Databases like CellPhoneDB, CellChat, and NicheNet have systematically compiled ligand-receptor pairs that mediate intercellular communication, documenting thousands of potential interaction pathways. Simultaneously, experimental studies have characterized specific instances of cellular cooperation (such as metabolic cross-feeding in microbial communities and paracrine signaling in development) and competition (including cell competition in development and cancer cell interactions with stromal cells). However, these datasets remain largely siloed within their respective research communities, preventing synthesis that could reveal general principles.

The molecular mechanisms underlying cell-cell interactions are inherently complex. Cells communicate through direct contact via adhesion molecules, through secreted factors including growth factors and cytokines, through metabolite exchange, and through mechanical forces. The same molecular pathways can mediate both cooperative and competitive outcomes depending on cellular and environmental context. For instance, Notch signaling drives lateral inhibition (competitive) in some contexts but promotes coordinated differentiation (cooperative) in others. TGF-β signaling can suppress or promote tumor progression depending on the cellular milieu. This context-dependency has made it challenging to derive general principles from individual studies.

Evolutionary game theory provides a powerful framework for understanding social interactions, having successfully explained cooperation and competition in organismal ecology. Classical models like the Prisoner's Dilemma, Snowdrift Game, and Public Goods Game have illuminated conditions favoring different interaction strategies. Recent work has begun applying these frameworks to cellular systems, revealing that cancer cells can exhibit game-theoretic dynamics and that microbial communities follow predictable evolutionary trajectories. However, these theoretical approaches have rarely been integrated with molecular-level data on the specific genes, proteins, and pathways mediating cellular interactions.

Spatial context critically influences interaction outcomes. Spatial transcriptomics studies have revealed that cell types organize into distinct neighborhoods with characteristic interaction profiles. In tumors, the spatial arrangement of cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells determines therapeutic responses. In development, morphogen gradients and cell sorting create spatial patterns essential for tissue organization. Yet we lack systematic approaches for linking spatial organization patterns to underlying molecular interaction mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics.

Several key gaps limit current understanding. First, we lack comprehensive catalogs of which molecular mechanisms mediate cooperation versus competition across biological contexts. Second, the evolutionary logic underlying interaction strategy selection remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Third, we cannot predict interaction outcomes in mixed populations based on molecular profiles. Fourth, we lack computational tools for integrating molecular interaction data with spatial context and population dynamics. Finally, training programs rarely bridge the disciplinary divides between molecular cell biology, evolutionary biology, and theoretical ecology.

This synthesis project is timely for several reasons. The requisite data now exists across multiple public repositories, but has never been systematically integrated. Computational methods for analyzing spatial omics data, inferring cell-cell communication, and modeling evolutionary dynamics have matured sufficiently to enable rigorous synthesis. The biological importance is clear: understanding cellular cooperation and competition is essential for addressing cancer (where competitive dynamics drive progression), regenerative medicine (where cooperative interactions enable tissue repair), infectious disease (where pathogen-host-microbiome interactions determine outcomes), and fundamental questions about the evolution of multicellularity. This project will transform isolated datasets into integrated knowledge, revealing principles of cellular social behavior that transcend specific biological systems.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This synthesis project addresses three overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes.

Research Question 1: What molecular mechanisms distinguish cooperative from competitive cell-cell interactions across biological contexts? We hypothesize that cooperative and competitive interactions are mediated by distinct molecular signatures that can be identified through systematic analysis of ligand-receptor pairs, downstream signaling pathways, and metabolic exchanges. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) Cooperative interactions will be enriched for symmetric bidirectional signaling pathways (where both cell types send and receive similar signals), while competitive interactions will show asymmetric signaling patterns. (H1b) Cooperative interactions will involve resource-sharing mechanisms (metabolite exchange, growth factor provision), while competitive interactions will involve resource-sequestration mechanisms (nutrient depletion, growth inhibition). (H1c) The same ligand-receptor pairs can mediate cooperation or competition depending on downstream pathway activation states, which we will identify through integration of signaling pathway databases with interaction outcome data. We will test these hypotheses by systematically categorizing cell-cell interactions from published datasets as cooperative or competitive based on experimental outcomes (mutual benefit, mutual harm, or asymmetric effects), then comparing the molecular profiles of these interaction categories. Expected outcomes include a molecular taxonomy of interaction types and identification of pathway modules that predict interaction outcomes.

Research Question 2: How do cellular interaction strategies evolve, and what molecular changes underlie evolutionary transitions between cooperation and competition? We hypothesize that evolutionary transitions in interaction strategies follow predictable trajectories constrained by molecular pathway architecture and driven by game-theoretic payoff structures. Our specific predictions are: (H2a) Evolutionary transitions from competition to cooperation require molecular innovations that align individual and collective fitness, which we predict will involve evolution of costly signaling mechanisms or partner recognition systems. (H2b) Phylogenetic analysis will reveal that cooperative interactions are evolutionarily derived from competitive or neutral interactions more often than the reverse, reflecting the challenge of maintaining cooperation. (H2c) Molecular pathways mediating interactions will show signatures of selection (elevated dN/dS ratios, gene duplication, regulatory evolution) that correlate with interaction strategy. We will test these hypotheses through comparative genomic analysis of interaction pathway components across species, phylogenetic reconstruction of interaction strategy evolution, and integration with experimental evolution data from microbial systems where interaction strategies have been tracked over time. We will apply evolutionary game theory models parameterized with molecular data to predict evolutionary trajectories and validate predictions against observed evolutionary patterns. Expected outcomes include evolutionary models of interaction strategy transitions and identification of molecular innovations enabling cooperation.

Research Question 3: What determines interaction outcomes when multiple cell types with different interaction strategies coexist in mixed populations? We hypothesize that spatial organization, population structure, and molecular interaction networks jointly determine which interaction strategies succeed in mixed populations. Our specific predictions are: (H3a) Spatial clustering of cooperators will emerge in systems where cooperation provides local benefits, which we will detect through spatial transcriptomics analysis showing enrichment of cooperative interaction signatures in spatially coherent cell neighborhoods. (H3b) Competitive exclusion versus stable coexistence will be predictable from the structure of molecular interaction networks, with highly connected networks (many interaction pathways between cell types) promoting coexistence. (H3c) Interaction outcomes in mixed populations will follow game-theoretic predictions when parameterized with molecular interaction strengths derived from gene expression data. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing spatial transcriptomics datasets to quantify spatial organization of cell types with different interaction profiles, correlating spatial patterns with molecular interaction signatures, and developing agent-based models that simulate population dynamics based on molecular interaction data. We will validate model predictions against experimental data on mixed population outcomes from cancer competition experiments and microbial coculture studies. Expected outcomes include predictive models of mixed population dynamics and spatial analysis tools for identifying interaction neighborhoods.

Cross-cutting validation approaches will test hypotheses across all three research questions. We will perform leave-one-out cross-validation where models trained on data from specific biological systems (e.g., cancer) are tested on independent systems (e.g., development or microbial communities). We will conduct sensitivity analyses to identify which molecular features most strongly predict interaction outcomes. We will compare predictions from molecular data against predictions from game theory models to assess whether molecular mechanisms align with evolutionary logic. All hypotheses will be evaluated using rigorous statistical frameworks with appropriate multiple testing corrections. Deliverables include quantitative metrics of interaction types, evolutionary models with molecular resolution, and validated predictive tools for analyzing cell-cell interactions in spatial omics data.

Methods And Approach

Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types through a multi-phase analytical pipeline combining bioinformatics, spatial analysis, evolutionary modeling, and game theory.

Data Sources and Integration: We will compile and harmonize data from multiple public repositories. For molecular interaction data, we will use CellPhoneDB (>3,000 ligand-receptor pairs), CellChat, NicheNet, and KEGG pathway databases to create a comprehensive catalog of interaction mechanisms. For spatial context, we will analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets from public repositories including the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), developmental atlases (e.g., BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network), and published spatial omics studies (>200 datasets identified through systematic literature review). For interaction outcomes, we will compile cancer cell competition data from DepMap, metabolic cooperation data from microbial coculture studies in BioStudies, paracrine signaling data from developmental biology databases, and immune-tumor interaction data from TCIA. For evolutionary analysis, we will use comparative genomics data from Ensembl, phylogenetic databases (TimeTree), and experimental evolution datasets from the LTEE and other long-term evolution experiments. All datasets will be processed through standardized pipelines to ensure compatibility, with metadata harmonization following FAIR principles.

Phase 1 (Months 1-8): Molecular Characterization of Interaction Types. We will develop a computational pipeline to classify cell-cell interactions as cooperative, competitive, or neutral based on experimental outcome data. For each interaction, we will extract molecular features including: ligand-receptor pair identities and expression levels, downstream signaling pathway activation (inferred using PROGENy and DoRothEA), metabolic exchange potential (predicted using genome-scale metabolic models), and cellular response signatures (differential gene expression in interacting versus non-interacting cells). We will apply supervised machine learning (random forests, gradient boosting) to identify molecular features that distinguish interaction types, with cross-validation across biological systems. Unsupervised clustering will identify molecular interaction modules. Network analysis will map relationships between interaction pathways. This phase will produce a molecular taxonomy of interaction types and predictive models of interaction outcomes from molecular profiles.

Phase 2 (Months 6-14): Spatial Analysis of Interaction Neighborhoods. We will develop spatial analysis methods to identify where different interaction types occur in tissues. For each spatial transcriptomics dataset, we will: (1) identify cell types using reference-based annotation, (2) infer cell-cell communication using CellPhoneDB and our enhanced interaction database, (3) quantify spatial organization using neighborhood analysis, spatial autocorrelation, and point pattern analysis, (4) correlate spatial patterns with interaction signatures from Phase 1. We will implement these analyses in a computational pipeline using Squidpy, Giotto, and custom Python/R code. Statistical significance will be assessed through spatial permutation tests. We will identify recurrent spatial motifs (interaction neighborhoods that appear across datasets) using graph mining approaches. This phase will produce spatial interaction atlases for multiple tissue types and computational tools for spatial interaction analysis.

Phase 3 (Months 10-18): Evolutionary Analysis of Interaction Strategies. We will reconstruct the evolutionary history of interaction pathways using comparative genomics and phylogenetic methods. For key interaction pathway components identified in Phase 1, we will: (1) identify orthologs across species using reciprocal BLAST and synteny analysis, (2) construct gene phylogenies using maximum likelihood methods, (3) estimate selection pressures using PAML and HyPhy, (4) map interaction strategies onto species phylogenies to infer evolutionary transitions, (5) test for correlations between molecular evolution and interaction strategy evolution. We will integrate experimental evolution data by analyzing genomic and transcriptomic changes in microbial populations where interaction strategies have evolved. This phase will produce evolutionary models of interaction strategy transitions and identify molecular innovations associated with cooperation evolution.

Phase 4 (Months 12-22): Game Theory Modeling and Prediction. We will develop game-theoretic models of cell-cell interactions parameterized with molecular data. For each interaction type, we will: (1) define payoff matrices based on fitness effects measured in experimental studies, (2) parameterize interaction strengths using gene expression levels and pathway activities, (3) implement evolutionary game theory models (replicator dynamics, adaptive dynamics) to predict strategy evolution, (4) develop agent-based models incorporating spatial structure to simulate mixed population dynamics, (5) validate predictions against experimental outcomes from competition assays and coculture experiments. Models will be implemented in Python using established frameworks (egttools, Mesa) with custom extensions. Sensitivity analysis will identify key parameters. This phase will produce predictive models of interaction dynamics and software tools for game-theoretic analysis of molecular interaction data.

Phase 5 (Months 18-24): Integration, Validation, and Tool Development. We will integrate findings across phases into a unified framework. We will perform cross-system validation by testing whether principles identified in one biological context (e.g., cancer) apply to others (e.g., development). We will develop user-friendly computational tools packaged as R/Python libraries and web interfaces for: (1) predicting interaction types from molecular profiles, (2) analyzing spatial interaction patterns in omics data, (3) modeling interaction dynamics using game theory. All tools will include comprehensive documentation and tutorials. We will organize two workshops to train users and gather feedback. This phase will produce integrated models, validated tools, and training materials.

Timeline and Milestones: Month 6: Complete data compilation and harmonization. Month 12: Complete molecular taxonomy of interaction types. Month 16: Complete spatial interaction atlases. Month 20: Complete evolutionary analysis and game theory models. Month 24: Release integrated tools and publish findings. The project will involve quarterly team meetings, monthly subgroup meetings, and continuous collaboration through shared computational infrastructure.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes spanning fundamental knowledge, computational tools, and workforce development, with broad impacts across molecular and cellular biology.

Fundamental Scientific Contributions: The project will produce the first comprehensive Cell-Cell Interaction Atlas integrating molecular mechanisms, spatial contexts, and evolutionary dynamics across biological systems. This atlas will catalog thousands of cell-cell interactions, classifying each by molecular mechanism, interaction type (cooperative/competitive/neutral), spatial organization pattern, and evolutionary conservation. This resource will reveal general principles of cellular social behavior, including molecular signatures that predict interaction outcomes, spatial organization rules that govern interaction neighborhoods, and evolutionary constraints that shape interaction strategy evolution. These principles will address long-standing questions about the evolution of multicellularity, the maintenance of cooperation in cellular systems, and the context-dependency of signaling pathways. The atlas will be publicly accessible through an interactive web portal with search, visualization, and analysis capabilities.

Methodological Innovations: We will develop novel computational approaches for analyzing cell-cell interactions that integrate molecular, spatial, and evolutionary data. Specific tools include: (1) InteractPredict, a machine learning pipeline for predicting interaction types from molecular profiles with validated accuracy across biological systems; (2) SpatialInteract, an R/Python package for identifying and analyzing interaction neighborhoods in spatial transcriptomics data; (3) EvoGame, a framework for parameterizing game theory models with molecular data and predicting interaction dynamics. These tools will be released as open-source software with comprehensive documentation, addressing current limitations in spatial omics analysis and evolutionary systems biology. The methodological framework will be applicable beyond cell-cell interactions to other synthesis challenges requiring integration of molecular mechanisms with population dynamics and evolutionary theory.

Biomedical and Biotechnological Applications: Understanding cellular cooperation and competition has immediate applications in cancer biology, where competitive dynamics between cancer cells and with stromal cells drive progression and therapeutic resistance. Our predictive models will enable identification of interaction vulnerabilities that could be targeted therapeutically. In regenerative medicine, principles of cooperative cellular interactions will inform tissue engineering strategies that promote coordinated cell behavior. In microbial ecology, understanding cooperation and competition will enable rational design of synthetic microbial communities for biotechnology applications. We will engage with clinical and industrial collaborators to translate findings into applications.

Training and Workforce Development: The project will train the next generation of data-savvy researchers through multiple mechanisms. We will support 4-6 graduate students and postdocs as core team members, providing interdisciplinary training spanning molecular biology, evolutionary biology, computational biology, and theoretical ecology. We will organize two annual workshops (48 participants total) providing hands-on training in spatial omics analysis, game theory modeling, and synthesis research approaches. We will develop online training modules covering project methods and tools, freely available to the broader community. We will mentor undergraduate researchers through summer research programs, prioritizing participants from underrepresented groups and non-R1 institutions. All trainees will gain experience in collaborative team science, open science practices, and science communication.

Dissemination and Publication Strategy: We will publish findings in high-impact journals spanning multiple disciplines (e.g., Cell, Nature Communications, eLife for biological findings; PLOS Computational Biology, Bioinformatics for methods; Evolution, American Naturalist for evolutionary insights). We will target 8-12 publications over the project period, including a flagship paper presenting the integrated Cell-Cell Interaction Atlas and principle findings. All publications will be open access. We will present findings at major conferences across relevant fields (American Society for Cell Biology, Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, Ecological Society of America). We will engage broader audiences through institutional press releases, social media, and science communication articles. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be deposited in public repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, Dryad) following FAIR principles, with detailed documentation enabling reproducibility.

Long-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes a foundation for ongoing synthesis research on cellular interactions. The Cell-Cell Interaction Atlas will be maintained as a community resource with mechanisms for incorporating new data as it becomes available. The computational tools will be sustained through open-source development models with community contributions. We will establish a Cell-Cell Interaction Synthesis Network connecting researchers across disciplines to continue collaborative work beyond the initial funding period. The interdisciplinary team assembled for this project will pursue follow-up research addressing emergent questions, including: How do interaction strategies respond to environmental perturbations? How do multi-way interactions (beyond pairwise) shape cellular communities? Can we predict evolutionary trajectories of interaction strategies? We will seek additional funding to expand the synthesis to additional biological systems and interaction types. The training programs will be institutionalized through participating universities, ensuring sustained workforce development. This project will catalyze a new research paradigm integrating molecular mechanisms with evolutionary and ecological theory to understand cellular social behavior.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_01,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Chromatin Grammar of Cellular Identity: Emergence of Cell Fate from the Integrated Epigenome,"A fundamental question in biology is how the ~200 distinct cell types in the human body, each sharing the same genome, emerge and maintain their unique identities. This identity is encoded not in the DNA sequence itself, but in the dynamic, multi-layered epigenome. We propose to form a working group to address the hypothesis that a 'chromatin grammar'—a set of combinatorial rules governing the interplay of DNA accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding—dictates cellular identity as an emergent property. This project will synthesize a vast repository of publicly available single-cell and bulk functional genomics data, including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, and RNA-seq from consortia like ENCODE, the Human Cell Atlas, and Roadmap Epigenomics. Our multidisciplinary team, comprising computational biologists, chromatin experts, developmental biologists, and machine learning specialists, will develop a novel integrative framework. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including graph neural networks and transformers, we will move beyond simple correlations to build predictive models that can infer cell type from chromatin state alone and simulate cell fate transitions. The project will deliver a publicly accessible 'Chromatin State Atlas' and a computational model of the emergent logic of cell identity. This work will provide profound insights into development, disease (like cancer, where identity is lost), and regenerative medicine, while training a new generation of scientists in large-scale data synthesis and modeling.",,"Background And Significance

The differentiation of a single zygote into the hundreds of specialized cell types that constitute a complex organism is a marvel of biological self-organization. While every cell shares an identical genome, each cell type exhibits a unique and stable gene expression program that defines its identity and function. This cellular diversity arises from the epigenome, a complex layer of chemical modifications to DNA and its associated histone proteins that orchestrates genome function without altering the underlying DNA sequence. The epigenome encompasses DNA methylation, dozens of post-translational histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and the three-dimensional folding of the genome. Understanding how these layers of information are integrated to produce stable cellular identities is a central challenge in modern biology. 

Over the past two decades, large-scale international consortia such as the ENCODE Project, the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium, and the Human Cell Atlas have generated an unprecedented wealth of publicly available data cataloging these epigenetic features across a vast array of human cell types and tissues. These efforts have been instrumental in creating a 'parts list' for the human epigenome. For instance, specific histone modifications are strongly correlated with the activity of functional elements: H3K4me3 marks active promoters, while H3K27ac is a hallmark of active enhancers (Heintzman et al., 2007, Nature). Computational methods like ChromHMM and Segway have leveraged these correlations to segment the genome into a limited number of 'chromatin states' (e.g., 'active promoter', 'poised enhancer'), providing a valuable, albeit simplified, annotation of the non-coding genome (Ernst & Kellis, 2012, Nature Methods). These models have successfully linked genetic variants to disease by identifying their location within specific regulatory elements.

However, this descriptive, correlational understanding has significant limitations. It treats epigenetic marks largely as independent features, failing to capture the complex, combinatorial, and context-dependent interplay between them. The 'histone code' hypothesis, which posited that specific combinations of modifications act in concert to signal downstream functions (Strahl & Allis, 2000, Nature), has proven difficult to decipher with simple linear models. We currently possess a 'dictionary' that links individual marks to functions, but we lack a 'grammar'—a set of rules that explains how these marks are combined in sequence and in three-dimensional space to compose the complex regulatory programs that define a cell. We do not yet understand how cellular identity emerges as a robust, system-level property from these local molecular interactions. Consequently, we lack the ability to predict a cell's identity from its chromatin state *de novo* or to simulate the dynamic epigenetic transitions that occur during development or disease.

This research is both important and timely due to the convergence of two key factors. First, the explosion of single-cell multi-omic technologies is providing data at a resolution that was previously unimaginable, allowing us to observe the epigenome's heterogeneity and dynamics within cell populations. Synthesizing these vast, disparate datasets is a community-scale challenge that no single lab can tackle alone. Second, recent breakthroughs in machine learning, particularly deep learning architectures like graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers, provide powerful new tools for learning complex patterns and long-range dependencies in high-dimensional data. These models are perfectly suited to move beyond simple correlations and learn the non-linear, combinatorial rules of the chromatin grammar. By forming a multidisciplinary working group to synthesize existing public data with these advanced analytical strategies, we are poised to address this fundamental gap in knowledge, yielding profound insights into the logic of cellular identity with direct implications for developmental biology, cancer research, and regenerative medicine.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is driven by the overarching hypothesis that cellular identity is an emergent property governed by a decipherable, predictive 'chromatin grammar'. We will test this central hypothesis through three specific, interconnected research aims, each addressing fundamental questions about the structure, function, and dynamics of the epigenome.

**Aim 1: Define the fundamental units and syntax of the chromatin grammar.**
This aim seeks to move beyond annotating individual epigenetic marks to identifying the recurrent, combinatorial patterns that form the building blocks of regulatory programs. We will deconstruct the complex epigenome into its core components and the rules governing their assembly.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** What are the fundamental, recurrent combinations of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding that constitute the 'words' of the epigenome across diverse human cell types?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a finite, learnable set of multi-modal 'chromatin motifs' exists, representing stereotyped regulatory states (e.g., a 'pluripotency enhancer' motif, a 'neuronal promoter' motif). These motifs are more informative than any single epigenetic mark alone. We predict that our unsupervised models will not only rediscover known patterns, such as bivalent promoters in stem cells (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3), but also uncover novel, cell-type-specific combinations that define unique regulatory functions.
*   **Research Question 1.2:** What are the syntactic rules governing the arrangement of these chromatin motifs along the linear genome and their organization in 3D space to control gene expression?
*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that the spatial organization of chromatin motifs follows non-random, hierarchical rules. The 'syntax' of the grammar dictates which genes are expressed by governing enhancer-promoter communication within 3D topologically associating domains (TADs). We predict that graph-based models incorporating Hi-C data will reveal that cell-type-specific gene expression programs are encoded in the network topology of long-range chromatin interactions, and that disruptions to this syntax are associated with aberrant gene regulation.

**Aim 2: Build a predictive model of cellular identity from the integrated epigenome.**
This aim will leverage the discovered grammar to construct a comprehensive, predictive model that maps chromatin state to cellular identity. This represents a critical test of our understanding, moving from description to prediction.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Can a machine learning model, trained on a multi-modal atlas of chromatin states, accurately predict a cell's identity (type, subtype, and state) from its epigenomic profile alone?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that the chromatin state contains sufficient information to uniquely and robustly specify cell identity. An integrative deep learning model will learn the high-dimensional mapping from the epigenome to cell type with greater accuracy than models based on single data modalities or gene expression profiles. We predict our model will successfully classify cells from lineages not seen during training, demonstrating its ability to learn generalizable principles of the grammar.
*   **Research Question 2.2:** What is the minimal and sufficient set of genomic loci and associated chromatin features required to define a given cellular identity?
*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** We hypothesize that cell identity is specified by a core set of 'master' regulatory loci whose chromatin states are both necessary and sufficient. Using model interpretability techniques (e.g., attention scores, in silico saturation mutagenesis), we will identify these key genomic 'hubs'. We predict that a model trained only on these core loci will retain high predictive accuracy, providing a condensed, mechanistic view of the epigenetic basis of cell identity.

**Aim 3: Model the dynamics of cell fate transitions as a shift in chromatin grammar.**
This aim extends our static model to the dynamic processes of development and cellular reprogramming, treating cell fate transitions as programmatic shifts in the underlying chromatin grammar.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can our framework model the ordered sequence of changes in the chromatin landscape during cellular differentiation and predict intermediate states?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that cell fate transitions are not random walks but follow specific trajectories through a high-dimensional 'chromatin state space', constrained by the rules of the grammar. We predict that by training our model on pseudotime-ordered single-cell data from developmental systems (e.g., hematopoiesis), it will learn a latent representation of this state space. This will allow us to simulate differentiation trajectories, identify key decision points (bifurcations), and predict the sequence of epigenetic events required to transition from one cell state to another. This predictive capability will be validated against held-out time-course datasets.

Methods And Approach

Our approach is a multi-year, multi-institutional effort centered on the synthesis of public data using a novel, integrated computational framework. The project is structured around our three research aims and is designed to be open, reproducible, and collaborative.

**Data Acquisition, Harmonization, and Integration (Year 1, Q1-Q3)**
This foundational phase is critical for the project's success. We will aggregate a comprehensive collection of publicly available human functional genomics data from major consortia, including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and the 4D Nucleome (4DN) project, as well as individual studies from GEO/SRA.
*   **Data Types:** We will focus on core data modalities that define the epigenome: ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), ChIP-seq for key histone modifications (activating: H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3; repressive: H3K27me3, H3K9me3), ChIP-seq for the architectural protein CTCF, and Hi-C/Micro-C (3D genome architecture). We will also integrate corresponding RNA-seq data for model validation and interpretation.
*   **Processing Pipeline:** To overcome heterogeneity from different experimental protocols and labs, we will establish a single, unified processing pipeline. This pipeline will be built using Nextflow for scalability and portability, incorporating best-practice tools (e.g., BWA, MACS2, Juicer) and adhering to ENCODE processing standards. The entire workflow will be containerized using Docker and Singularity, ensuring complete reproducibility. All raw and processed data will be meticulously annotated with standardized metadata (cell type, tissue, donor, experimental conditions) and organized into a cloud-based, queryable database using efficient formats like Zarr or HDF5.

**Aim 1: Deciphering Chromatin Grammar (Year 1, Q4 - Year 2, Q4)**
We will develop a novel machine learning framework to learn the combinatorial rules of the epigenome.
*   **Genomic Representation:** We will represent the genome as a multi-graph. Genomic bins (e.g., 500 bp) will serve as nodes. Each node will have a feature vector containing the normalized signals from all integrated data types (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, etc.). Edges will connect nodes in two ways: 1) 'sequential' edges connecting adjacent bins along the chromosome, and 2) 'long-range' edges connecting physically interacting bins, weighted by contact frequency from Hi-C data.
*   **Modeling Approach:** We will employ a hybrid deep learning architecture. To capture local combinatorial patterns ('chromatin motifs'), we will use Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which can learn the importance of different features and neighboring nodes. To capture the linear syntax and long-range dependencies along the chromosome, we will adapt the Transformer architecture, which has excelled at learning context in natural language. By treating the sequence of genomic bins as a 'sentence' and chromatin motifs as 'words', the Transformer's self-attention mechanism can identify critical regulatory elements hundreds of kilobases apart. We will use unsupervised methods, such as clustering the learned node embeddings from the GAT/Transformer encoder, to systematically identify and classify the fundamental 'words' of the chromatin grammar.

**Aim 2: Predictive Modeling of Cell Identity (Year 2, Q1 - Year 3, Q2)**
We will build and validate a supervised model to predict cell type from chromatin state.
*   **Model Architecture:** The encoder developed in Aim 1 will serve as the foundation. We will add a classification head to this encoder and train the entire model end-to-end in a supervised fashion. The input will be the multi-modal chromatin state for a given genomic region (e.g., a 2 Mb window), and the output will be a probability distribution over a controlled vocabulary of cell types derived from the Cell Ontology.
*   **Training and Validation:** We will use the harmonized data from hundreds of cell types for training. To ensure robustness and avoid batch effects, we will employ a rigorous cross-validation strategy, holding out entire donors or tissues for testing. Model performance will be evaluated using metrics like area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We will perform extensive model interpretation using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and attention map visualization to identify the genomic loci and feature combinations most predictive of each cell type, directly testing Hypothesis 2.2.

**Aim 3: Modeling Cell Fate Dynamics (Year 3, Q1 - Year 4, Q2)**
We will extend our framework to model the dynamic transitions between cell states.
*   **Data:** We will utilize public datasets that capture cellular differentiation, such as time-course single-cell multi-omic data from hematopoietic stem cell differentiation or directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells.
*   **Modeling Approach:** We will employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. The model will learn to project the high-dimensional chromatin state of single cells into a low-dimensional latent space. By incorporating pseudotime information derived from trajectory inference algorithms (e.g., Palantir), we will structure this latent space to represent differentiation pathways as smooth trajectories. This will allow us to perform in silico experiments: we can 'walk' along these trajectories to predict the sequence of chromatin state changes, identify bifurcation points representing cell fate decisions, and simulate the effects of perturbing key TFs by observing the resulting shift in the trajectory.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of data harmonization pipeline; first-generation chromatin motif catalog.
*   **Year 2:** Release of Chromatin State Atlas v1.0; development and initial validation of the cell identity prediction model; first major publication.
*   **Year 3:** Refined predictive model with full interpretability analysis; development of the dynamic VAE model for cell fate transitions; public release of the 'Chromatin Grammar Engine' software.
*   **Year 4:** Validation of dynamic simulations; capstone publications summarizing the chromatin grammar; final release of all data, models, and web portal; final working group meeting and community workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will produce a suite of tangible deliverables and generate significant intellectual and practical impacts, fundamentally advancing the molecular and cellular biosciences. Our work is designed to create lasting resources for the scientific community and to train a new generation of data-savvy biologists, directly aligning with the core mission of the NCEMS program.

**Expected Outcomes and Deliverables:**
1.  **A Unified, Harmonized Human Epigenome Atlas:** Our first major outcome will be a comprehensive, consistently processed atlas of multi-modal epigenomic data from hundreds of human cell types. This resource, far exceeding what any single lab could produce, will eliminate a major barrier in the field—data heterogeneity—and serve as a foundational dataset for countless future studies on gene regulation, development, and disease.
2.  **The 'Chromatin Grammar Engine':** We will deliver a powerful, open-source deep learning model capable of predicting cell identity from chromatin state and simulating cell fate transitions. The software will be fully documented, containerized, and made available on platforms like GitHub and Docker Hub, allowing any researcher to apply our state-of-the-art methods to their own data.
3.  **A Publicly Accessible Web Portal:** To ensure our findings are accessible to the entire biological community, including those without computational expertise, we will create an interactive web portal. This portal will allow users to explore the identified chromatin motifs, visualize the grammatical rules, query the importance of specific genomic regions for defining cell identity, and browse the complete epigenome atlas.
4.  **A Quantitative Framework for Cellular Identity:** The primary intellectual outcome will be a new, quantitative framework for understanding cellular identity as an emergent property of the epigenome. We will deliver a catalog of the fundamental 'words' (chromatin motifs) and 'syntactic rules' that constitute the chromatin grammar, shifting the field from a descriptive to a predictive science.

**Broader Scientific and Societal Impact:**
*   **Transforming Basic Biology:** By providing a predictive model of gene regulation, our work will offer profound insights into fundamental biological processes. It will provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how cell lineages are established during embryogenesis and how cellular identity is maintained with high fidelity throughout life.
*   **Advancing Human Health:** The implications for medicine are significant. In **cancer research**, our model can be used to understand how epigenetic dysregulation leads to a loss of cellular identity and the acquisition of malignant, de-differentiated states. This could reveal novel diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring a normal epigenetic state. In **regenerative medicine**, a predictive understanding of the chromatin grammar will provide a blueprint for designing more efficient and precise protocols for cellular reprogramming and directed differentiation, accelerating the development of cell-based therapies for diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, and heart failure.
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is an exemplary training vehicle. Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will form the core of the working group, receiving unique cross-disciplinary training at the intersection of computational biology, machine learning, and chromatin biology. Through co-mentorship across participating labs, they will build collaborative skills and professional networks essential for future leadership in data-intensive science. We will further broaden our impact by developing and hosting an annual summer workshop on data synthesis and computational epigenomics for the wider community.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
We are deeply committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science. All software will be developed openly on GitHub. All analysis workflows will be shared as portable containers. All data, models, and results will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., GEO, Zenodo) and made accessible through our web portal prior to publication. We plan to disseminate our findings through high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at major international conferences, and seminars at diverse institutions. This working group will establish a lasting collaborative network that will continue to pursue these fundamental questions, ensuring the long-term sustainability and impact of the project.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory or existing collaboration. The sheer scale of data aggregation and harmonization, the computational demands of training state-of-the-art deep learning models, and the essential requirement for deep, integrated expertise from disparate scientific fields (machine learning, computational biology, chromatin biology, developmental biology) necessitate the unique collaborative and resource-intensive environment provided by an NCEMS Working Group. NCEMS support is critical for funding the dedicated personnel, high-performance computing resources, and collaborative infrastructure required to achieve our ambitious goals.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_02,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,Deconstructing Allostery: Mapping the Emergent Communication Networks of Macromolecular Machines,"Allostery, the process by which a binding event at one site of a protein or complex affects a distant functional site, is a quintessential emergent property that underpins cellular regulation. However, the pathways of allosteric communication through large, dynamic macromolecular machines like the ribosome, proteasome, or spliceosome remain poorly understood. This working group will pioneer a community-scale effort to create a unified 'Allosteric Atlas' by systematically mapping these communication networks. We will not generate new experimental data, but instead integrate and synthesize three major public data types: 1) thousands of static structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) to build structural ensembles; 2) deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to identify functionally coupled residues; and 3) molecular dynamics simulation trajectories to capture conformational dynamics. Our team, uniting structural biologists, biophysicists, computer scientists, and biochemists, will develop novel computational methods based on network theory and information theory to trace the flow of information through these complexes. The goal is to build predictive models that can identify cryptic allosteric sites, forecast the functional consequences of mutations (including those associated with disease), and guide the rational design of allosteric drugs. This project will transform our understanding of molecular regulation from a one-site-at-a-time view to a holistic, network-based perspective.",,"Background And Significance

Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation, enabling proteins and their complexes to act as sophisticated information processing devices. First conceptualized through the classic Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) models, allostery was initially described as a ligand-induced switch between discrete conformational states. While these models provided a powerful foundation, they are insufficient to describe the complex, continuous, and often subtle communication that occurs within large, multi-subunit macromolecular machines. Today, allostery is increasingly understood not as a simple mechanical switch, but as a quintessential emergent property arising from the complex interplay of a protein's structure, dynamics, and sequence evolution. It is the collective behavior of hundreds or thousands of residues, connected through a dense network of interactions, that gives rise to long-range communication. Understanding this emergent phenomenon is one of the grand challenges in molecular and cellular biology.

The current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data and a diversity of powerful, yet fragmented, approaches. Experimentally, high-resolution structural methods like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy provide static snapshots of different functional states, offering clues about conformational changes. Techniques like hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and NMR spectroscopy provide insights into protein dynamics. Crucially, the advent of deep mutational scanning (DMS) has enabled the high-throughput quantification of functional consequences for thousands of mutations, revealing complex epistatic relationships between residues that hint at underlying communication pathways. Computationally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can model the dynamic motions of proteins at atomic resolution, while methods like normal mode analysis (NMA) can describe low-frequency collective motions relevant to allostery. Network-based models, such as Protein Structure Networks (PSNs), have successfully identified allosteric pathways by representing proteins as graphs of interacting residues, building on pioneering work by Bahar, Nussinov, and others.

Despite these advances, significant gaps in our knowledge persist. The primary limitation is data fragmentation. Structural data from the PDB/EMDB, functional data from DMS databases like MaveDB, and dynamic data from MD simulations exist in separate, unlinked repositories. There is no unifying framework to integrate these disparate data types into a single, coherent model of allosteric communication. This fragmentation prevents us from seeing the full picture. A second major gap is scale. Most detailed allosteric studies have focused on smaller, single-domain proteins or dimers. The principles governing allosteric communication across the vast distances and multiple interfaces of megadalton-scale machines like the ribosome, proteasome, or spliceosome remain largely uncharted territory. Finally, current approaches are often more descriptive than predictive. While we can sometimes rationalize observed allosteric effects, we lack the ability to reliably predict, *a priori*, which residues will form a communication pathway, where cryptic allosteric sites might be located, or how a novel mutation will impact function from a distance.

This research is critically important and timely for several reasons. First, the exponential growth of public data in structural, sequencing, and functional genomics databases has created an unprecedented opportunity for a large-scale synthesis project. For the first time, sufficient data exists to attempt a systematic mapping of allosteric networks. Second, advances in computational power and machine learning provide the necessary tools to integrate these massive, heterogeneous datasets. Third, a deeper understanding of allostery has profound biomedical implications. Allosteric drugs, which target sites other than the active site, can offer greater specificity and fewer side effects, representing a new frontier in pharmacology. Furthermore, many disease-causing mutations, particularly variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely exert their pathogenic effects by disrupting allosteric regulation rather than by directly ablating catalytic activity. By creating a predictive, network-based framework for allostery, this project will provide a foundational resource to accelerate rational drug design and improve our interpretation of the human variome.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this working group is to establish a new paradigm for understanding allostery, moving from qualitative descriptions to a quantitative, predictive, and generalizable network-based framework. By synthesizing vast public datasets, we will construct and validate an 'Allosteric Atlas' for key macromolecular machines, addressing fundamental questions about the nature of molecular communication. Our research is structured around three central questions, each with testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: How can structurally, dynamically, and functionally diverse data types be integrated to construct a unified, multi-layered representation of allosteric networks?**
Current approaches typically rely on a single data modality (e.g., structure or dynamics), providing an incomplete view. We posit that a holistic model requires data fusion.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A multi-layered network model, where nodes (residues) are connected by edges weighted by a composite score derived from structural proximity (PDB/EMDB), dynamic cross-correlations (MD simulations), co-evolutionary couplings (sequence alignments), and functional epistasis (DMS data), will capture allosteric pathways with significantly higher fidelity than any single-layer network.
*   **Prediction:** Allosteric pathways identified using our integrated model will show a statistically significant higher enrichment for known functionally critical residues, disease-associated mutations (from ClinVar), and experimentally validated allosteric sites compared to pathways derived from structure-only or dynamics-only networks.
*   **Validation:** We will rigorously benchmark our integrative method on a 'gold standard' set of well-characterized allosteric proteins (e.g., hemoglobin, GPCRs, protein kinases). Using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), we will quantify the predictive power of our multi-layered approach versus single-layer models in identifying known allosteric residues.

**Research Question 2: What are the conserved architectural principles and emergent properties of allosteric communication networks across different classes of macromolecular machines?**
We seek to determine if there are universal 'rules' governing information flow in proteins or if network architecture is tailored to specific biological functions.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Allosteric communication does not occur through random walks but is channeled along evolutionarily conserved 'information highways' composed of residues with distinct biophysical properties, such as high mechanical stress, optimal packing, and low conformational entropy.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The global topology of allosteric networks will differ between classes of molecular machines. For example, processive machines like the ribosome may feature linear, directional pathways, whereas regulatory hubs like the proteasome may exhibit more distributed, scale-free network architectures to integrate multiple signals.
*   **Prediction:** A comparative analysis of the Allosteric Atlases for the ribosome (translation), proteasome (degradation), and spliceosome (RNA processing) will reveal both conserved network motifs (e.g., critical 'hub' residues at subunit interfaces) and distinct topological signatures (e.g., average path length, clustering coefficient) that correlate with their biological roles.
*   **Validation:** We will employ a suite of graph theory metrics to characterize network topologies. We will test the hypothesis that residues identified as high-centrality hubs in our networks are significantly enriched for post-translational modification sites, disease mutations, and sites of evolutionary conservation, providing independent lines of evidence for their functional importance.

**Research Question 3: Can our integrated network model be used to make actionable predictions about novel allosteric sites and the functional consequences of mutations?**
A truly successful model must move beyond description to prediction, generating testable hypotheses for the broader scientific community.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The propagation of allosteric signals can be modeled as information flow on our weighted graph, allowing for the quantitative prediction of a perturbation's (e.g., mutation or ligand binding) effect at a distant functional site using concepts from information theory, such as mutual information.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** By systematically calculating the information transfer efficiency from every residue to a known active site, we can generate whole-protein 'allosteric potential' maps, which will reveal cryptic or previously unknown allosteric sites suitable for therapeutic targeting.
*   **Prediction:** Our model will identify specific, high-potential residues in the 26S proteasome, distant from the catalytic chamber, that are predicted to allosterically modulate its proteolytic activity. Furthermore, our model will classify a significant fraction of currently annotated VUS in disease-relevant proteins as likely pathogenic or benign based on their predicted disruption of critical allosteric pathways.
*   **Validation:** While this project will not generate new experimental data, all predictions will be made publicly available through our web portal to be tested by the community. We will perform retrospective validation by assessing our model's ability to distinguish known pathogenic from benign variants in benchmark datasets. We will also track the reclassification of VUS in public databases over time to prospectively validate our predictions.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group composed of four collaborating labs with expertise in structural biology, computational biophysics, data science/machine learning, and biochemistry. The project is organized into a four-phase workflow, with significant cross-lab collaboration and trainee involvement at each stage.

**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** The four PIs and their trainees will form a cohesive unit, meeting virtually bi-weekly and in-person at an annual workshop. A shared computational infrastructure, including a centralized database, a common GitHub organization for code development, and a project-wide Slack channel, will facilitate seamless collaboration. Trainees (postdocs and graduate students) will be co-mentored and will lead specific sub-projects, ensuring they gain cross-disciplinary skills in data synthesis, computational modeling, and team science.

**Phase 1: Systematic Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase focuses on aggregating and standardizing the public data that fuel our models. We will develop a robust, automated pipeline for this process.
*   **Data Sources:** We will target three major macromolecular machines: the human ribosome, the 26S proteasome, and the spliceosome. For each, we will systematically gather: 1) **Structural Data:** All available X-ray, cryo-EM, and NMR structures from the PDB and EMDB, including different conformational states, species orthologs, and ligand-bound forms. 2) **Sequence/Evolutionary Data:** We will construct deep multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for each subunit from the UniRef100 and TrEMBL databases. 3) **Functional Data:** We will mine public repositories like MaveDB for relevant deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets. 4) **Dynamic Data:** We will collate publicly available MD simulation trajectories from sources like the PDB, aMD-share, and literature-associated repositories.
*   **Data Integration Platform:** A key deliverable of this phase is a unified data schema. All data will be mapped onto a common reference structure for each complex using robust structural alignment algorithms. This process will handle challenges like different numbering schemes, missing domains, and species variations, creating a consistent, analysis-ready dataset.

**Phase 2: Multi-Layered Allosteric Network Construction (Months 6-18)**
Using the harmonized data, we will construct a multi-layered network representation for each complex.
*   **Layer 1 (Static Structural Network):** An ensemble of networks will be built from all curated structures. Nodes are Cα atoms, and edge weights will be derived from inter-residue distances, capturing the range of observed conformations.
*   **Layer 2 (Dynamic Correlation Network):** From MD trajectories, we will calculate the dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) between all residue pairs, with edge weights representing the degree of correlated motion.
*   **Layer 3 (Co-evolutionary Network):** Using our MSAs, we will apply direct coupling analysis (DCA) methods (e.g., GREMLIN) to compute co-evolutionary scores, which identify residues that evolve together, often due to functional or structural constraints.
*   **Layer 4 (Functional Epistasis Network):** Where DMS data is available, we will calculate pairwise epistatic scores between mutations to build a network based on functional coupling.
*   **Network Integration:** We will develop a novel machine learning framework (e.g., a weighted ensemble method or a graph neural network) to integrate these four layers. The final edge weight between any two residues will represent the synthesized evidence of their connection within an allosteric communication channel. This integration method is a core innovation of our proposal.

**Phase 3: Network Analysis and Pathway Identification (Months 15-30)**
With the integrated networks constructed, we will identify and characterize allosteric pathways.
*   **Pathway Algorithms:** We will implement and compare multiple algorithms to trace information flow. These will range from classic graph theory approaches like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to more sophisticated models based on current flow in resistor networks (e.g., Resistor Network Theory) and information theory. Specifically, we will calculate the mutual information between the states of residue pairs across the structural/dynamic ensemble to quantify information transfer capacity.
*   **Identification of Critical Nodes and Edges:** We will use a suite of network centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality, closeness centrality) to identify 'hub' residues and 'bottleneck' edges that are predicted to be critical for allosteric signal transduction.

**Phase 4: Model Validation, Prediction, and Dissemination (Months 24-36)**
*   **Validation:** We will rigorously validate our framework by testing its ability to recapitulate known biological features. We will quantify the overlap between our predicted high-centrality nodes/pathways and independently determined data, including: 1) known catalytic and binding sites; 2) sites of post-translational modifications; 3) known disease mutations from ClinVar and HGMD; and 4) experimentally determined allosteric sites from the literature.
*   **Prediction and Atlas Generation:** For our target complexes, we will generate comprehensive, predictive 'Allosteric Atlases'. These atlases will consist of the integrated networks and maps of predicted communication pathways emanating from key functional sites. We will use these to predict novel, cryptic allosteric sites and to score the potential pathogenicity of VUS.
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   **Year 1:** Complete data curation pipeline; develop and benchmark network integration framework on test systems. First annual workshop.
    *   **Year 2:** Construct integrated networks for the proteasome and ribosome; implement and compare pathway prediction algorithms. Submit methods-focused manuscript.
    *   **Year 3:** Complete analysis of all target machines; generate predictive Allosteric Atlases; launch public web portal for data dissemination. Submit application-focused manuscripts. Host final dissemination workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, with broad impacts on biomedical research and workforce development. Our contributions will be both conceptual and practical, providing new knowledge, new tools, and a foundational resource for the scientific community.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A New Paradigm for Allostery:** Our primary intellectual contribution will be to shift the conceptualization of allostery from a qualitative, protein-specific phenomenon to a quantitative, network-based science. By developing a generalizable framework, we will provide the language and tools to describe allostery as an emergent property of complex systems, enabling systematic comparison and the discovery of universal principles of molecular communication.
2.  **Methodological Innovation in Data Synthesis:** We will pioneer a novel computational pipeline for the synthesis of heterogeneous data types—structural, dynamic, evolutionary, and functional. This integrative approach addresses a major bottleneck in modern biology, where data is abundant but often siloed. The methods we develop for data harmonization and multi-layer network integration will be broadly applicable to other complex biological questions beyond allostery.
3.  **Creation of a Foundational 'Allosteric Atlas':** The project will deliver a unique, high-value resource for the scientific community. The Allosteric Atlas for the ribosome, proteasome, and spliceosome will be the first comprehensive map of information flow in these essential molecular machines. This resource, accessible via a public web portal, will serve as a hypothesis-generation engine, enabling researchers to explore communication pathways, interpret mutational data, and design new experiments.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Accelerating Therapeutic Discovery:** A key practical outcome will be the identification of novel, cryptic allosteric sites on therapeutically important targets. Allosteric drugs offer the potential for greater specificity and novel modes of action compared to traditional active-site inhibitors. Our Allosteric Atlas will provide a rational basis for targeting complexes like the proteasome (a key cancer target) or the bacterial ribosome (a target for antibiotics), opening new avenues for drug development.
2.  **Improving Understanding of Human Disease:** Our framework will provide a powerful tool for interpreting the functional consequences of genetic variation. Many disease-causing mutations, especially the vast number of 'variants of uncertain significance' (VUS), likely exert their effects by subtly disrupting allosteric regulation. By mapping these variants onto our communication networks, we can develop a mechanistic basis for predicting their pathogenicity, aiding in genetic diagnosis and personalized medicine.
3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Scientists:** This project is an ideal training vehicle. Its inherently collaborative and interdisciplinary nature will equip graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with a unique skillset at the intersection of biophysics, computer science, and biology. They will gain hands-on experience in large-scale data analysis, computational modeling, open-source software development, and 'team science'—precisely the skills needed for the future scientific workforce. We will further amplify this impact through annual workshops and by making all our training materials publicly available.
4.  **Commitment to Open and Reproducible Science:** This project is fundamentally committed to the principles of open science. All software developed will be released under a permissive open-source license on GitHub. All curated data, network models, and analysis workflows (e.g., as Jupyter notebooks) will be made publicly available. The final Allosteric Atlas will be disseminated through a user-friendly web portal, ensuring that our results are not only published but are also accessible, explorable, and reusable by the entire community. This commitment ensures the long-term impact and sustainability of our work.

**Dissemination Plan:** Our findings will be disseminated broadly through high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at major international conferences (e.g., Biophysical Society, ISMB), and the aforementioned public web portal. In the final year, we will host a community workshop to train other researchers in the use of our tools and to foster new collaborations, ensuring the methods and resources from this project are widely adopted.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the scope and resources of any single research laboratory. It requires the deep integration of expertise from four distinct scientific disciplines—structural biology, computational biophysics, computer science, and biochemistry—and a coordinated effort to curate, integrate, and analyze massive public datasets. The development of a public-facing, sustainable resource like the Allosteric Atlas also requires dedicated support that falls outside the purview of traditional research grants. The NCEMS program, with its focus on catalyzing multidisciplinary teams for data synthesis, is uniquely suited to support this ambitious project.

**Budget Justification:** The total requested budget is allocated to support the personnel, computational infrastructure, and collaborative activities essential for the project's success over a three-year period.

*   **Personnel (65%):** The majority of the funds will support the dedicated researchers who will execute the project. This includes four Postdoctoral Fellows, one in each of the four collaborating PIs' labs. These fellows will form the core research team, driving the development of the computational pipeline and the analysis of the target systems. We also request support for four Graduate Students, who will focus on specific sub-projects while receiving invaluable cross-disciplinary training. Partial summer salary is requested for the four PIs to provide scientific oversight, coordinate the working group, and lead training activities. Finally, we request support for a part-time Data Manager/Software Engineer to ensure robust data management practices, oversee the development of the public web portal, and manage open-source code releases.

*   **Computational Resources (15%):** While we will leverage the substantial high-performance computing (HPC) resources at our respective institutions, the sheer scale of the data aggregation and network analysis necessitates dedicated cloud computing resources (e.g., Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform). These funds will be used for large-scale data storage, burstable computing capacity for intensive calculations (e.g., network construction from thousands of structures), and for hosting the robust, publicly accessible web portal and database.

*   **Travel (10%):** Collaboration is the cornerstone of this project. We request funds to support an annual in-person workshop for the entire working group (PIs, postdocs, and students). These multi-day meetings are indispensable for intensive brainstorming, resolving technical challenges, strategic planning, and fostering a cohesive team environment. Funds are also included for trainees and PIs to travel to one major international conference each year to present our findings, disseminate our tools, and engage with the broader scientific community.

*   **Publication and Dissemination (5%):** To adhere to our open science commitment, we request funds to cover open-access publication fees for our anticipated manuscripts. A portion of this budget is also allocated for the design, development, and long-term maintenance of the Allosteric Atlas web portal.

*   **Indirect Costs (F&A):** Indirect costs are calculated based on the federally negotiated rates for each participating institution.

**Existing Resources:** This proposal leverages significant institutional support, including access to university-maintained HPC clusters, data storage infrastructure, and institutional software licenses. The PIs' labs provide the necessary office and lab space. The requested NCEMS funds are specifically for the personnel and collaborative resources that make this large-scale synthesis project feasible.",,
ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_03,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,In Silico Origins: The Emergence of Autocatalytic Metabolic Networks from Prebiotic Chemistry,"The transition from a non-living chemical environment to the first self-sustaining, metabolizing life form is one of the greatest unsolved puzzles in science. This emergence of life was likely predicated on the formation of autocatalytic chemical networks capable of self-replication and evolution. This working group proposes a novel, purely computational approach to explore the plausible pathways for the emergence of primordial metabolism. We will synthesize and integrate disparate public data sources into a unified 'Prebiotic Chemical Universe' knowledge base. This includes: 1) comprehensive chemical reaction data from databases like KEGG and Rhea; 2) quantum chemistry calculations on the feasibility of prebiotic reactions; and 3) metabolomics data from diverse extant organisms to identify conserved core metabolic motifs. Our transdisciplinary team of systems biologists, computational chemists, evolutionary theorists, and astrobiologists will employ network expansion algorithms and principles from chemical engineering to simulate the growth of chemical networks from simple precursor molecules. We will search for the spontaneous emergence of autocatalytic cycles, identify key molecular 'scaffolds' that enable network complexity, and determine the minimal conditions required for a self-propagating metabolic system. This project will provide a principled, data-driven framework for generating testable hypotheses about the origin of life and the fundamental principles governing the emergence of biological complexity.",,"Background And Significance

The origin of life, or abiogenesis, represents the conceptual boundary between geochemistry and biochemistry, marking the emergence of complex, self-sustaining systems from a simpler, non-living chemical world. Understanding this transition is a fundamental challenge in science, with profound implications for biology, chemistry, and astrobiology. A central hypothesis in this field is the 'metabolism-first' model, which posits that self-propagating networks of chemical reactions, or protometabolism, preceded the emergence of template-replicating genetic molecules like RNA. These primordial metabolic networks would have needed to exhibit autocatalysis—the ability of a network's products to catalyze its own production—to achieve the persistence, growth, and eventual evolution necessary for life. Seminal theoretical work by pioneers like Oparin, Haldane, and later Kauffman on autocatalytic sets provided the conceptual framework, suggesting that given a sufficient diversity of molecules and reactions, self-sustaining cycles could emerge spontaneously. However, these early models were largely abstract and lacked a concrete chemical basis. Experimental work, from the classic Miller-Urey experiment demonstrating abiotic synthesis of amino acids to more recent studies on non-enzymatic glycolysis and reverse Krebs cycle analogs, has shown that many of the building blocks and reactions of modern metabolism are prebiotically plausible. Despite this progress, the field faces significant hurdles that prevent a comprehensive understanding of metabolic origins. A primary limitation is the fragmented nature of our knowledge. Data on plausible prebiotic reactions are scattered across disparate fields and databases, including organic chemistry literature, geochemical models of early Earth environments, and biological databases of extant metabolic pathways. There is no unified, computationally accessible repository that integrates these diverse data sources. Consequently, current computational models of protometabolism are often based on heavily curated subsets of modern biochemistry, which introduces a strong 'retrodictive' bias and may overlook novel, non-biological pathways that were critical stepping stones. Furthermore, the feasibility of many proposed prebiotic reactions under realistic conditions—considering temperature, pressure, pH, and the catalytic effects of mineral surfaces—is often assumed rather than rigorously evaluated. This leaves a critical gap between abstract network theory and concrete chemical reality. The combinatorial explosion of possible reactions from even a simple set of precursor molecules makes an exhaustive search for emergent properties computationally intractable without a principled, data-driven approach to constrain the search space. This project is both important and timely because it directly addresses these gaps through a large-scale data synthesis approach. The recent explosion in publicly available biochemical data (KEGG, Rhea), chemical reaction databases (Reaxys), and computational chemistry tools allows us, for the first time, to construct a comprehensive 'Prebiotic Chemical Universe' knowledge base. By integrating these datasets, we can move beyond biased, retrodictive models and instead simulate the forward evolution of chemical complexity from a set of plausible initial conditions. This project's scale and inherent transdisciplinarity—requiring expertise in systems biology, quantum chemistry, evolutionary theory, and data science—make it an ideal endeavor for a community-scale working group. It is beyond the scope of any single research lab and directly aligns with the call's focus on synthesizing public data to address fundamental questions of emergence in the molecular sciences.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this working group is to develop and implement a data-driven, computational framework to simulate the emergence of complex, self-sustaining metabolic networks from a simple prebiotic chemical environment. By synthesizing disparate public datasets into a unified reaction universe, we will explore the plausible pathways from geochemistry to biochemistry. This goal is broken down into four specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) and their corresponding testable hypotheses. 

**RQ1: What is the structure and scope of a plausible 'Prebiotic Chemical Universe' (PCU) reaction network when integrating data from geochemistry, computational chemistry, and modern biology?**
This question addresses the foundational need for a comprehensive, unbiased map of possible prebiotic reactions. 
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** An integrated network of plausible prebiotic reactions, constrained by thermodynamic feasibility, will be topologically distinct from modern metabolic networks, exhibiting lower average connectivity and a different modular structure, yet will contain the seeds of biological complexity. 
*   **Prediction:** We predict the PCU graph will have a power-law degree distribution but with a different exponent and clustering coefficient compared to the KEGG network. We expect to find that certain reaction classes (e.g., aldol additions, redox reactions) form highly connected cores within this network.

**RQ2: Under what initial conditions (e.g., starting molecule sets, catalytic environments, energy sources) do autocatalytic cycles and self-propagating networks spontaneously emerge from the PCU?**
This question probes the environmental and chemical factors that trigger the transition from a static collection of chemicals to a dynamic, growing system.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** The emergence of autocatalysis is not a generic property of complex chemical systems but depends critically on a combination of specific mineral catalysts (e.g., iron-sulfur surfaces) and a continuous influx of a limited set of high-energy precursors (e.g., HCN, formaldehyde, phosphate).
*   **Prediction:** Our network expansion simulations will demonstrate a phase transition-like behavior. Below a certain threshold of catalytic enhancement or substrate availability, networks will be small and terminate quickly. Above this threshold, we will observe the rapid formation of large, self-propagating networks containing autocatalytic cycles. We will quantify this threshold as a function of environmental parameters.

**RQ3: What are the key topological features and molecular 'scaffolds' that facilitate the transition from simple linear pathways to complex, interconnected, and autocatalytic networks?**
This question seeks to identify the critical components—the 'linchpins'—that enable the bootstrapping of metabolic complexity.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** A small subset of versatile molecules (e.g., pyruvate, glyoxylate, simple sugars) act as crucial network hubs or 'scaffolds,' connecting disparate chemical pathways and enabling the closure of cycles. These molecules are not necessarily the most abundant but are the most topologically important.
*   **Prediction:** Using network centrality measures (e.g., betweenness centrality), we will identify a small set of high-scoring molecules in our emergent networks. *In silico* 'knockout' experiments, where we remove these molecules from the initial seed set or disallow their formation, will disproportionately cripple network growth and prevent autocatalysis compared to the removal of random molecules.

**RQ4: How do the structures of emergent *in silico* protometabolic networks compare to the conserved core metabolic pathways observed across all domains of life?**
This question addresses the long-standing debate of whether core metabolism is a 'frozen accident' of evolution or a deterministic outcome of fundamental chemical principles.
*   **Hypothesis 4 (H4):** The core logic of central carbon metabolism, particularly pathways like the reverse Krebs cycle (rTCA) and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, represents a robust, convergent solution for carbon fixation and biosynthesis that will emerge repeatedly in simulations under reducing prebiotic conditions.
*   **Prediction:** Using subgraph isomorphism and network alignment algorithms, we will find that a significant fraction of our successful, autocatalytic simulations independently converge on networks containing motifs that are topologically and chemically homologous to the rTCA cycle or other ancient pathways, even when starting from diverse initial conditions.

Methods And Approach

Our research plan is structured into three synergistic phases, executed by a transdisciplinary team over 24 months. The entire project will adhere to open science principles, with all code and data developed collaboratively on a shared platform like GitHub.

**Phase 1: Construction of the 'Prebiotic Chemical Universe' (PCU) Knowledge Base (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase focuses on data synthesis and integration. The PCU will be structured as a graph database (using Neo4j), where nodes are chemical compounds and edges are reactions.
*   **Data Sources:** We will integrate several distinct, publicly available data types. 1) **Biochemical Reactions:** We will extract reaction data from KEGG, MetaCyc, and Rhea databases. Using established methods for generating generalized reaction rules (e.g., based on bond changes), we will infer plausible non-enzymatic analogs. 2) **General Chemical Reactions:** We will mine the Reaxys database to include a broader scope of organic reactions not typically found in biological contexts. 3) **Experimental Prebiotic Chemistry:** We will perform systematic literature mining of journals like *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres* to curate a set of experimentally verified prebiotic reactions. 4) **Thermodynamic and Kinetic Data:** Each reaction edge will be annotated with Gibbs free energy (ΔG) values. These will be sourced from databases like Equilibrator or, for novel reactions, calculated using quantum chemistry methods (DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G* level) to assess feasibility under various temperature and pH conditions. 5) **Catalysis Data:** We will incorporate information on the catalytic potential of early Earth minerals (e.g., iron sulfides, clays) from geochemical databases and the literature, encoding this as a potential reduction in the activation energy for specific reaction classes.

**Phase 2: Network Expansion Simulations (Months 7-18)**
This phase uses the PCU to simulate the growth of chemical networks from simple beginnings.
*   **Algorithm:** We will implement a network expansion algorithm in Python, leveraging libraries like RDKit for chemical informatics and NetworkX for graph analysis. The simulation proceeds iteratively: 
    1.  Initialize the network with a 'seed set' of simple molecules presumed abundant on the early Earth (e.g., H₂O, CO₂, CH₄, NH₃, HCN). 
    2.  At each step, query the PCU to find all reactions whose substrates are all present in the current network and satisfy a thermodynamic threshold (e.g., ΔG < 0). 
    3.  Add the products of these feasible reactions to the network, creating new nodes. 
    4.  Repeat until the network ceases to grow or reaches a predefined complexity.
*   **Computational Experiments:** We will conduct a large ensemble of simulations to robustly test our hypotheses. We will systematically vary key parameters, including: the composition of the initial seed set (reflecting different origin scenarios like hydrothermal vents vs. atmospheric synthesis), temperature and pH (which affect ΔG), and the inclusion of specific catalytic rules that mimic mineral surfaces. This systematic exploration will allow us to map the 'parameter space' that leads to the emergence of complexity.

**Phase 3: Analysis of Emergent Networks (Months 12-24)**
In this phase, we will analyze the structure and properties of the networks generated in Phase 2.
*   **Detection of Autocatalysis:** We will employ algorithms to identify autocatalytic motifs, from simple single-reaction cycles to complex, collectively autocatalytic RAF (Reflexively Autocatalytic and Food-generated) sets. This analysis is key to identifying self-sustaining systems.
*   **Topological and Chemical Analysis:** We will use a suite of graph-theoretic metrics to characterize the emergent networks, including degree distribution, clustering, and modularity. We will use centrality measures (betweenness, eigenvector) to pinpoint the 'scaffold' molecules predicted in H3. 
*   **Comparative Analysis:** To test H4, we will use network alignment and subgraph isomorphism algorithms (e.g., an adaptation of BLAST for chemical networks) to compare the topology of our emergent networks against the core metabolic maps from KEGG. This will provide a quantitative measure of the similarity between *in silico* emergent pathways and extant biology.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **M6:** Public release of PCU knowledge base v1.0 and associated API.
*   **M12:** Completion of the first major ensemble of simulations; submission of a methods paper.
*   **M18:** Comprehensive analysis of autocatalytic networks and identification of key molecular scaffolds; presentation at a major international conference.
*   **M24:** Completion of comparative analysis with extant metabolism; submission of primary research articles; final working group meeting and public workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate significant outcomes that advance the field of origin of life studies and have broader impacts across several scientific disciplines. Our contributions are designed to be tangible, open, and foundational for future research.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **The Prebiotic Chemical Universe (PCU) Knowledge Base:** Our primary deliverable will be the PCU, a comprehensive, computationally accessible graph database of plausible prebiotic reactions. This will be an invaluable community resource, unifying fragmented data from chemistry, biology, and geochemistry. It will enable researchers to move beyond anecdotal evidence and build quantitative, testable models of prebiotic systems.
2.  **Data-Driven Pathways for Metabolic Emergence:** Instead of relying on speculation or biased retrodiction from modern biology, our project will generate a set of the most plausible, thermodynamically constrained pathways for the emergence of protometabolism. We will provide a ranked list of emergent autocatalytic cycles, offering a principled answer to the question, 'What did the first metabolisms look like?'
3.  **A New Methodological Framework:** Our integrated pipeline—combining data synthesis, network expansion, and graph-theoretic analysis—will establish a powerful new methodology for studying emergence in complex chemical systems. This framework can be adapted to investigate other emergent phenomena, such as the formation of protocells or the evolution of signaling networks.
4.  **Testable Hypotheses for Experimentalists:** By identifying key molecular scaffolds and critical environmental conditions, our *in silico* findings will generate specific, high-priority hypotheses for experimental validation. For example, we might predict that a specific dicarboxylic acid is essential for closing a protometabolic cycle in the presence of iron-sulfide catalysts, a prediction that can be directly tested in the lab.

**Broader Impacts:**
*   **Astrobiology and the Search for Life:** By defining the fundamental chemical principles and minimal conditions required for metabolic emergence, our work will directly inform astrobiology. It will help constrain the environmental conditions necessary for life to arise and refine the types of molecular biosignatures that missions like the James Webb Space Telescope should search for on exoplanets.
*   **Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology:** Understanding the principles of self-organizing chemical networks has direct applications in synthetic biology. Our findings could inspire novel designs for artificial metabolic pathways in engineered microbes for producing biofuels or pharmaceuticals, or contribute to the long-term goal of creating a synthetic protocell from non-living components.
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is an ideal cross-disciplinary training ground. Trainees (postdocs and graduate students) will gain a unique combination of skills in data science, computational chemistry, systems biology, and evolutionary theory. Through collaborative work in a distributed team, they will be trained to become the next generation of data-savvy scientists, perfectly aligning with the research call's objectives.
*   **Public Outreach and Dissemination:** We are committed to open science. All data (PCU), software, and results will be made publicly available via FAIR-compliant repositories (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo). We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. Furthermore, the topic of life's origins has broad public appeal. We will develop interactive web-based visualizations of our network simulations to engage students and the public, making complex scientific concepts accessible.

**Long-Term Vision:** This project lays the groundwork for a comprehensive *in silico* model of abiogenesis. The working group established here will be uniquely positioned to secure future funding to extend this framework, integrating it with models of membrane encapsulation and the emergence of primitive genetic polymers, ultimately aiming for a complete, dynamic simulation of a protocell.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_04,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Cancer Kinome's Emergent Logic: Predicting Therapeutic Resistance and Plasticity through Network Synthesis,"The ability of cancer cells to resist targeted therapies and adapt to treatment is an emergent property of their rewired signaling networks. The protein kinome, a network of over 500 kinases, is a central hub for this rewiring, yet its complexity makes therapeutic responses difficult to predict. This working group will address this challenge by building dynamic, context-specific models of the cancer kinome. We will synthesize a massive collection of public data, including phosphoproteomics, genomics, and transcriptomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), alongside drug sensitivity data from the GDSC and CTRP databases for thousands of cancer cell lines. Our team, composed of cancer biologists, systems biologists, bioinformaticians, and clinical pharmacologists, will develop a machine learning framework to learn the rules of kinome rewiring in different cancer subtypes and in response to specific kinase inhibitors. The primary goal is to create predictive models that can identify emergent feedback loops and bypass pathways that lead to drug resistance before they arise. These models will be used to systematically predict synergistic drug combinations that can exploit network vulnerabilities and overcome the emergent robustness of the cancer kinome. This project will produce a powerful open-source platform for in silico drug screening and hypothesis generation, accelerating the development of more durable cancer therapies.",,"Background And Significance

The advent of targeted cancer therapies, particularly protein kinase inhibitors, has revolutionized oncology, offering remarkable efficacy in patient subsets with specific molecular alterations. Drugs like imatinib for CML and gefitinib for EGFR-mutant lung cancer exemplify the power of precision medicine. However, the initial success of these therapies is frequently undermined by the development of resistance, which remains a formidable clinical challenge. Resistance is not a simple, monolithic event but an emergent property of the complex, adaptive system of cellular signaling networks. At the heart of this system lies the protein kinome, comprising over 500 kinases that regulate virtually all cellular processes. In cancer, this network is extensively rewired, creating a robust and plastic system that can rapidly adapt to therapeutic insults. Understanding and predicting this adaptive rewiring is paramount to developing more durable cancer treatments.

Current understanding of resistance is largely based on two classes of mechanisms: on-target alterations, such as secondary mutations in the drug's target kinase (e.g., the T790M 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR), and off-target rewiring. The latter is far more complex and involves the activation of parallel or downstream signaling pathways that bypass the inhibited node. For instance, MET amplification can confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors by activating the ERBB3-PI3K pathway independently of EGFR. Similarly, feedback loops, where the inhibition of a downstream kinase leads to the paradoxical reactivation of upstream signaling, are common. A classic example is the reactivation of the MAPK pathway through RAF dimerization following BRAF inhibitor treatment in melanoma. While these individual mechanisms are well-documented, they represent a reductionist view of a system-level problem. We lack a holistic understanding of the 'logic' of kinome rewiring—the generalizable principles and network motifs that govern how the entire system responds to perturbation.

The past decade has witnessed an explosion of publicly available, large-scale molecular and pharmacological data. Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) have generated comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic maps for thousands of tumors across dozens of cancer types. Concurrently, pharmacogenomic screens such as the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) have profiled the sensitivity of over 1,000 cancer cell lines to hundreds of small molecules. These datasets represent an unprecedented resource, yet their full potential has not been realized. Most analyses have focused on identifying simple biomarker-drug associations (e.g., BRAF mutation predicts BRAF inhibitor sensitivity), which often fail to capture the network context that dictates the ultimate therapeutic outcome. Previous modeling efforts have either been limited to small, well-characterized pathways or have used statistical models that treat genes as independent features, ignoring the intricate network topology that defines their function. The key gap in the field is the absence of a comprehensive, data-driven framework that can synthesize these disparate data types to model the kinome as an integrated, dynamic system. Such a model is essential to move beyond predicting sensitivity to single agents and begin predicting the emergent, adaptive responses that lead to resistance. This project is timely and critical because it leverages the confluence of massive public data availability and recent advances in network-based machine learning to address this fundamental gap. By building a predictive model of kinome plasticity, we aim to systematically uncover the vulnerabilities of this adaptive system, providing a rational basis for the design of robust combination therapies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group is founded on the central premise that therapeutic resistance is an emergent property of kinome network dynamics that can be modeled and predicted through the synthesis of large-scale public data. Our research is structured around three specific, interconnected questions designed to deconstruct this complexity and translate the resulting knowledge into actionable therapeutic hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: What are the conserved and cancer-type-specific patterns of kinome rewiring that mediate adaptive resistance to targeted kinase inhibitors?**
While individual resistance mechanisms have been identified, a global, systematic map of the network-level adaptations is lacking. We seek to identify recurrent 'rewiring modules'—sets of kinases and downstream effectors whose activities are coordinately altered—that represent common solutions evolved by cancer cells to bypass therapeutic inhibition. 
*   **Hypothesis 1:** We hypothesize that despite the genetic heterogeneity of cancers, the functional space of kinome resistance mechanisms is constrained, leading to the recurrent activation of a finite set of rewiring modules across diverse cancer contexts. These modules will involve coordinated changes in kinase phosphorylation, protein expression, and transcriptional programs that restore critical downstream cellular functions (e.g., proliferation, survival) that were suppressed by the drug.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will develop a multi-view matrix factorization and clustering approach to integrate phosphoproteomic, transcriptomic, and drug sensitivity data from CPTAC and GDSC. This method will identify modules of co-regulated genes and proteins whose activation state correlates with resistance to specific classes of inhibitors. The biological significance of these predicted modules will be validated by testing for enrichment of known signaling pathways (e.g., KEGG, Reactome) and by assessing their prognostic value in independent clinical datasets from TCGA. We expect to deliver a comprehensive atlas of these resistance modules, providing a functional blueprint of kinome plasticity.

**Research Question 2: Can a network-based machine learning model, which explicitly encodes the physical and functional relationships between kinases, predict cellular response to kinase inhibitors more accurately than feature-based models?**
Standard machine learning approaches for drug sensitivity prediction often treat genomic or transcriptomic features as an unstructured 'bag of features,' ignoring the underlying network topology. We propose that a model that 'understands' the structure of the kinome will learn a more robust and interpretable representation of cellular state.
*   **Hypothesis 2:** We hypothesize that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, built upon a comprehensive protein-protein interaction and kinase-substrate network, will outperform traditional models (e.g., Elastic Net, Random Forest) in predicting drug sensitivity. The GNN's architecture allows it to learn how signals propagate from a drug's target through the network, integrating information from the entire molecular context (mutations, expression levels) of a cell to predict the system's response.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will construct a baseline kinome graph using data from STRING, PhosphoSitePlus, and other databases. Node features will be derived from multi-omic data (mutations, CNV, gene expression) for ~1,000 cell lines. The GNN will be trained to predict IC50 values for hundreds of kinase inhibitors from GDSC. Performance will be rigorously evaluated using cross-validation and on held-out test sets of cell lines and drugs. The model's interpretability will be assessed by using graph attention mechanisms to identify the specific kinases and subnetworks most influential in predicting response to a given drug. The deliverable will be a validated, open-source predictive model of single-agent efficacy.

**Research Question 3: Can in silico perturbation of our dynamic kinome model systematically identify synergistic drug combinations that preemptively block adaptive resistance pathways?**
The ultimate goal is to use our understanding of network rewiring to design more effective therapies. Synergistic combinations are thought to work by targeting parallel pathways or by blocking feedback mechanisms. Our model provides a platform to test this concept systematically.
*   **Hypothesis 3:** We hypothesize that by simulating the effect of a single kinase inhibitor in our trained GNN model, we can predict the emergent resistance state of the kinome. The nodes (kinases) that become most 'activated' in this simulated resistant state are prime targets for a second, synergistic drug. We predict that drug combinations targeting the primary driver and the predicted bypass pathway will exhibit significant synergy.
*   **Testing and Validation:** For each primary inhibitor, we will perform an in silico perturbation within the GNN. We will analyze the resulting network state to identify and rank predicted bypass kinases. This will generate a ranked list of thousands of potential synergistic drug pairs. This list of predictions will be validated against large-scale experimental combination screening data, such as the NCI-ALMANAC database, which serves as a massive, independent truth set. The expected outcome is a validated computational pipeline for prioritizing novel combination therapies for experimental testing.

Methods And Approach

Our research plan is a multi-phase, integrative strategy that progresses from data synthesis to predictive modeling and therapeutic hypothesis generation. The entire workflow is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and compliant with open science principles.

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Acquisition, Harmonization, and Integration (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase focuses on assembling a unified, analysis-ready data resource. This task is substantial and requires dedicated bioinformatic expertise, making it ideal for a collaborative working group.
*   **Data Sources:** We will aggregate data from multiple public repositories. (1) **Molecular Profiles:** Genomics (somatic mutations, copy number variations) and transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). (2) **Proteomics:** Global and phosphoproteomics data (Mass Spectrometry, RPPA) from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and CCLE. (3) **Pharmacology:** Drug sensitivity metrics (IC50, AUC) for hundreds of compounds across >1,000 cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP), and the PRISM Repurposing Screen. (4) **Network Priors:** Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct. Kinase-substrate relationships from PhosphoSitePlus, SIGNOR, and NetworKIN.
*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** A systematic pipeline will be developed to process these heterogeneous datasets. This includes: quality control, consistent normalization methods (e.g., TPM for RNA-Seq, z-scoring for proteomics), batch effect correction where applicable, and mapping all genes, proteins, and compounds to standardized identifiers (e.g., HGNC, UniProt, PubChem). This curated, multi-modal data matrix will be a key deliverable for the community.

**Phase 2: Construction of a Dynamic, Context-Specific Kinome Network Model (Months 6-18)**
This phase addresses our first two research questions by developing our core predictive model.
*   **Graph Construction:** We will construct a large-scale graph representing the human kinome. Nodes will be proteins (primarily kinases), and edges will represent known interactions (PPIs, kinase-substrate). This base graph will be generic.
*   **Context-Specific Feature Engineering:** For each of the ~1,000 cell lines, we will decorate this graph with context-specific features. Each node will be assigned a feature vector containing its basal gene expression, mutation status, and copy number state. Edge weights can be modulated by evidence of co-expression or correlated phosphorylation patterns within a specific cancer type.
*   **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Development:** We will implement a Graph Attention Network (GAT), a state-of-the-art GNN architecture. The GAT is chosen for its ability to learn the relative importance of different neighbors in the network, making it highly interpretable. The model will take a cell line's feature-annotated kinome graph as input and will be trained to output a vector of predicted drug sensitivity values (AUCs) for a panel of ~200 kinase inhibitors. The loss function will be the mean squared error between predicted and experimental AUCs.
*   **Training and Validation:** The model will be trained on 80% of the cell lines. Hyperparameters will be tuned using a 10% validation set. Final performance will be evaluated on the remaining 10% held-out test set of cell lines. We will also perform out-of-sample validation on drugs not seen during training to assess the model's ability to generalize. Performance will be benchmarked against standard machine learning models (e.g., Elastic Net, Random Forest) to quantify the added value of the graph-based approach.

**Phase 3: In Silico Perturbation for Synergy Prediction and Mechanistic Insight (Months 18-30)**
This phase leverages the trained model to address our third research question.
*   **Perturbation Simulation:** To simulate the effect of a drug, we will perform an in silico 'knockdown' on its target node(s) in the input graph. This can be done by masking the node's features or by adding a strong negative bias to its initial state. We will then perform a forward pass through the trained GNN to predict the post-perturbation network state. The difference between the basal and perturbed internal node embeddings will represent the network's adaptive response.
*   **Identification of Resistance Pathways:** We will analyze the predicted post-perturbation state to identify kinases whose activity (as represented by their learned embeddings) is most significantly increased. These nodes represent the hubs of the emergent resistance network.
*   **Systematic Synergy Prediction:** This process will be automated. For each of the ~200 kinase inhibitors as a 'primary' drug, we will identify the top-k predicted resistance kinases. We will then score all possible 'secondary' drugs from our panel based on whether they target one of these resistance kinases. This will generate a comprehensive, ranked matrix of predicted synergistic combinations.
*   **Validation against Experimental Data:** Our primary validation set will be the NCI-ALMANAC database, which contains experimental synergy data for thousands of pairs. We will assess the enrichment of experimentally verified synergistic pairs in the top quantiles of our predicted synergy scores, using metrics like ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall curves.

**Phase 4: Dissemination and Platform Development (Months 24-36)**
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   **Year 1:** Complete data harmonization pipeline (M9). First prototype of the GNN model trained and benchmarked (M12).
    *   **Year 2:** Final validated single-drug prediction model (M18). Completion of systematic in silico perturbation screen (M24). First manuscript submitted.
    *   **Year 3:** Validation of synergy predictions against NCI-ALMANAC (M30). Launch of public web portal with query and visualization capabilities (M33). Final project report and publications (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce a transformative shift in our understanding of cancer therapy resistance, moving the field from a static, component-level view to a dynamic, system-level perspective. The expected outcomes are multifaceted, spanning fundamental scientific insights, powerful new computational tools, actionable therapeutic hypotheses, and significant contributions to training and open science, directly aligning with the core mission of the NCEMS research call.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary contribution will be a fundamentally new understanding of the emergent logic governing kinome plasticity. We will move beyond cataloging individual resistance mechanisms to defining the principles of network adaptation.
1.  **An Atlas of Kinome Rewiring:** We will deliver the first comprehensive, data-driven map of the functional modules that cancer cells use to adapt to therapeutic pressure. This 'rewiring atlas' will serve as a foundational resource for cancer biologists, revealing conserved vulnerabilities and context-specific dependencies across dozens of cancer types.
2.  **A Novel Predictive Framework:** Our Graph Neural Network model will represent a significant methodological advance for computational oncology. By explicitly incorporating network topology, it will provide more accurate and, crucially, more interpretable predictions than existing methods. The model's ability to identify the specific subnetworks driving a prediction will offer mechanistic insights that are absent in 'black-box' approaches.
3.  **High-Confidence Therapeutic Hypotheses:** Unlike purely correlational studies, our in silico perturbation approach provides a mechanistic rationale for each predicted synergistic drug combination. We will produce a prioritized list of novel combinations, complete with their predicted molecular mechanism of action (e.g., blocking a specific feedback loop). This will provide a rich set of testable hypotheses for the broader cancer research community, significantly de-risking and accelerating the preclinical drug development pipeline.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The impact of this work will extend far beyond the immediate working group, providing resources and knowledge that will catalyze research across academia and industry.
*   **Accelerating Translational Research:** The open-source platform and web portal will empower individual cancer researchers, who may lack the computational expertise to perform such large-scale analyses, to explore kinome dynamics. A biologist could, for example, query the model to predict sensitivity to a new inhibitor in their cell line of interest or to find the best combination partner for an existing drug, generating immediate, testable hypotheses for their lab.
*   **Informing Clinical Strategy:** While our work is preclinical, it lays the groundwork for network-based patient stratification. In the long term, models like ours could be adapted to use patient tumor data to predict optimal combination therapies, contributing to the vision of personalized medicine.

These activities are not the sum of individual microbes but are emergent properties arising from a dense web of metabolic competition, cross-feeding, and collaboration. This working group aims to decipher the principles governing the emergence of community-level function in the gut microbiome. We will integrate and synthesize multi-omic data from the world's largest public microbiome repositories, including the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the American Gut Project. This includes metagenomic data to identify community composition, metatranscriptomic data to assess gene activity, and metabolomic data to measure metabolic outputs. Our diverse team, including microbial ecologists, systems biologists, computer scientists, and nutritionists, will go beyond simple taxonomic cataloging. We will employ novel computational pipelines to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models for thousands of microbial species and assemble them into community-scale models. Using ecological theory and flux balance analysis, we will simulate nutrient flow, identify keystone species and metabolic handoffs, and predict how the system responds to perturbations like diet shifts or antibiotic administration. The project will deliver a dynamic, predictive model of the gut ecosystem, providing a framework for understanding dysbiosis and designing precision interventions (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics) to rationally engineer this critical emergent system.",,"Background And Significance

The human gut microbiome represents one of the most complex and densely populated ecosystems on Earth, comprising trillions of microorganisms that collectively encode a metabolic potential far exceeding that of their host. It is now unequivocally established that this microbial community is not a passive passenger but an active, integral component of human physiology, influencing nutrition, immune system development, and even neurological function. The collective behavior of this system is a quintessential example of emergence, where community-level functions, such as the production of neuroactive short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or the resistance to pathogen invasion, arise from a vast network of interactions between hundreds of microbial species. These functions cannot be predicted by studying microbes in isolation. Early microbiome research, driven by advances in DNA sequencing, focused on cataloging the taxonomic composition of the gut, successfully linking shifts in community structure (dysbiosis) to a wide range of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Seminal projects like the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT provided foundational datasets that revealed the immense inter-individual variability and the existence of a 'core' functional capacity despite taxonomic heterogeneity. However, this descriptive phase of microbiome science has yielded primarily correlational insights, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The central challenge has shifted from 'who is there?' to 'what are they doing, how, and why?'. To answer this, the field has embraced multi-omics, integrating metagenomics (genetic potential), metatranscriptomics (gene expression), proteomics (protein activity), and metabolomics (metabolic output). While these data types provide unprecedented depth, their integration remains a formidable challenge. Most analyses remain siloed, failing to capture the causal chain from gene to function within a complex community context. A key limitation of current approaches is the lack of a predictive, mechanistic framework. Ecological models based on Lotka-Volterra equations can describe population dynamics but often lack biochemical detail. In parallel, the field of systems biology has developed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), which are mathematical representations of an organism's entire metabolic network. Constraint-based modeling techniques like flux balance analysis (FBA) can use GEMs to predict metabolic fluxes and growth rates under specific environmental conditions. This approach has been successfully extended to model small microbial communities, revealing principles of metabolic cross-feeding (syntrophy) and competition. For instance, studies have shown how methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria depend on hydrogen produced by fermenters, a classic example of an emergent metabolic process. However, scaling these methods to the complexity of the human gut microbiome has been computationally and methodologically prohibitive. Existing community models are often limited to a few dozen well-characterized organisms, failing to capture the diversity of the system. Furthermore, they are typically static and do not adequately incorporate dynamic constraints from other omics data, such as gene expression levels from metatranscriptomics. This project is timely and crucial because we are at a technological and data-driven inflection point. The public availability of massive, multi-omic datasets from thousands of individuals provides the raw material for an unprecedented synthesis effort. Concurrently, advances in bioinformatics, including high-throughput metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) recovery and automated GEM reconstruction tools (e.g., CarveMe, gapseq), make it feasible to build models for thousands of previously uncultured organisms. By uniting a transdisciplinary team of microbial ecologists, systems biologists, and computer scientists, this working group is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between descriptive multi-omics and predictive, mechanistic understanding. We will move beyond correlation to causation, building a dynamic model of the gut ecosystem that can predict the emergence of function from structure. This will provide a foundational framework for the rational engineering of the microbiome, transforming our approach to nutrition and medicine.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this working group is to decipher the fundamental principles by which community-scale metabolic interactions generate emergent functional properties in the human gut microbiome. We will achieve this by developing and applying a predictive, multi-omic-constrained computational framework. Our research is structured around three specific, interconnected aims, each addressing key questions and testable hypotheses.

**Aim 1: Develop a scalable, integrated pipeline for constructing context-specific community metabolic models from public multi-omic data.** This aim establishes the core methodological foundation of our project.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can we systematically and accurately reconstruct thousands of high-quality, species-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from metagenomic data and integrate them into robust, sample-specific community models?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a hybrid computational pipeline, which combines the speed of automated GEM reconstruction tools with a data-driven, semi-automated curation process informed by phylogenetic context and known physiology, will produce models with significantly higher predictive accuracy for microbial growth phenotypes and metabolic capabilities compared to purely automated approaches. 
*   **Validation:** Reconstructed GEMs for cultured species will be validated against experimental data from the literature (e.g., Biolog growth assays). The predictive accuracy of the community models will be benchmarked by their ability to recapitulate known community-level functions in well-defined synthetic communities.
*   **Research Question 1.2:** How can metatranscriptomic and metabolomic data be systematically integrated to constrain community models, transforming them from static representations of genetic potential to dynamic models of in situ metabolic activity?
*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that integrating metatranscriptomic data to define reaction flux bounds and metabolomic data to set environmental nutrient conditions will dramatically improve the model's fidelity in predicting community-level metabolic outputs (e.g., fecal short-chain fatty acid profiles) compared to models constrained by metagenomic abundance alone.
*   **Validation:** Using datasets with matched multi-omics (e.g., HMP2), we will perform k-fold cross-validation. We will train the model constraints on a subset of samples and test its ability to predict the metabolomic profiles of held-out samples, measuring the correlation between predicted and observed metabolite concentrations.

**Aim 2: Identify the organizing principles and keystone components of the gut metabolic network.** This aim uses our validated models to uncover fundamental ecological and metabolic rules.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** What are the dominant patterns of metabolic interaction (e.g., competition, syntrophy, parasitism) that structure the gut community, and how do these patterns differ across host health states (e.g., healthy vs. IBD)?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that the gut metabolic network is not random but is organized into functional guilds—groups of taxonomically diverse species that perform similar metabolic roles (e.g., primary fiber degraders, lactate consumers, butyrate producers). We predict that ecosystem stability is conferred by high functional redundancy within these guilds and that dysbiosis is characterized by a loss of specific guilds or a breakdown in key metabolic handoffs between them.
*   **Validation:** We will apply network analysis algorithms to the simulated metabolic exchange fluxes from hundreds of community models. We will identify modules in this network that correspond to our hypothesized guilds and show that guild structure is more conserved across healthy individuals than taxonomic structure.
*   **Research Question 2.2:** Can we identify 'keystone species' or, more importantly, 'keystone functions' that have a disproportionate impact on the stability and emergent functions of the community?
*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** We hypothesize that metabolic keystones are organisms or enzymatic functions that uniquely provide or consume critical intermediate metabolites (e.g., H2, formate, essential amino acids) that link major metabolic pathways. Their in-silico removal will cause a significant, non-linear decrease in critical community functions, such as total biomass production or SCFA synthesis, that is far greater than predicted by their abundance alone.
*   **Validation:** We will perform systematic in-silico knockout simulations, removing one species at a time from the community models and quantifying the impact on key functional outputs. The results will allow us to rank species by their 'keystone index'.

**Aim 3: Build and validate a predictive model of microbiome response to defined perturbations.** This aim leverages our framework to make forward predictions, moving from explanation to prediction.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** How do dietary shifts (e.g., changes in fiber, fat, or protein content) and antibiotic administration alter the metabolic interaction network and emergent functions of the gut microbiome?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that our constrained community models can accurately predict the direction and magnitude of change in key metabolic outputs (e.g., butyrate/propionate ratio) in response to a simulated dietary intervention. For example, a simulated increase in dietary fiber will increase flux through fermentation pathways and select for butyrate-producing guilds, a prediction we can test against real-world data.
*   **Validation:** We will use our models to predict the outcomes of published dietary intervention studies where longitudinal multi-omic data is available. We will initialize our models with baseline data, simulate the dietary change by altering the nutrient input conditions, and compare the model's predicted endpoint metabolite and taxonomic profiles with the experimentally observed data.

Methods And Approach

This project will synthesize vast, publicly available multi-omic datasets using a novel, rigorous, and reproducible computational workflow. Our approach is designed to be modular, scalable, and transparent, adhering to the highest standards of open science. The transdisciplinary nature of our team is essential for the success of this multi-faceted methodology.

**Data Sources and Harmonization:**
We will leverage several of the world's largest and most comprehensive public microbiome datasets. Our primary sources include:
1.  **The Human Microbiome Project (HMP1 & HMP2/iHMP):** Provides metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic data from hundreds of healthy individuals and those with IBD, including valuable longitudinal data for tracking dynamic changes.
2.  **The American Gut Project (AGP):** Offers metagenomic data from over 10,000 individuals, providing immense statistical power for identifying generalizable patterns across a diverse population.
3.  **Other Cohorts:** We will incorporate data from other well-phenotyped cohorts with publicly available multi-omics, such as LifeLines-DEEP and TwinsUK, to enhance the robustness and generalizability of our findings.
A significant initial effort (Year 1, Q1-Q2) will be dedicated to data harmonization. We will develop a unified metadata schema to standardize variables such as host diet, disease status, age, sex, and medication use across all projects. A dedicated workflow, built using Snakemake, will automate the downloading, quality control (FastQC, Trimmomatic), and processing of all raw sequencing data from repositories like NCBI SRA.

**Computational Pipeline:**
Our core analytical pipeline consists of five interconnected modules:
*   **Module 1: Genome Recovery from Metagenomes:** For each metagenomic sample, we will perform de novo assembly using MEGAHIT. We will then use a suite of binning tools (MetaBAT2, MaxBin2, CONCOCT) to reconstruct Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). The resulting bins will be consolidated and refined using DAS Tool and evaluated for quality with CheckM. Only high-quality MAGs (Completeness > 90%, Contamination < 5%) will be retained, forming our comprehensive gut microbial genome catalog.
*   **Module 2: Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GEM) Reconstruction and Curation:** This is a cornerstone of our project. For each MAG and publicly available reference genome, we will reconstruct a GEM. We will employ a hybrid strategy: initial draft models will be generated using automated tools like CarveMe and gapseq. These drafts will then undergo a rigorous, semi-automated curation process. This involves using algorithms to identify and fill metabolic gaps, ensuring the model can produce biomass, and comparing model predictions to known metabolic capabilities. Our team's microbial physiologists and systems biologists will perform manual curation on key pathways (e.g., fermentation, vitamin biosynthesis) to ensure biochemical accuracy. All models will be standardized in SBML format, version-controlled, and housed in a public repository.
*   **Module 3: Community Model Assembly and Simulation:** For each host sample, we will construct a personalized community metabolic model. First, we will determine the relative abundance of each microbe in our catalog by mapping metagenomic reads from the sample back to the genomes. These abundances will define the composition of the community model. We will use the `micom` Python framework, which is specifically designed for efficient FBA of large microbial communities. The simulation environment (the 'diet') will be defined using a standard in-silico representation of a Western diet (e.g., from the Virtual Metabolic Human database), which specifies the nutrient influx into the system.
*   **Module 4: Multi-omic Constraint Integration:** To capture the in situ activity of the microbiome, we will integrate other omics data. Metatranscriptomic reads from a given sample will be mapped to the genes in our community's genomes. The resulting expression levels will be used to constrain the maximum allowable flux through the corresponding reactions in the model, using established algorithms like GIMME. This ensures that highly expressed pathways are more active in the simulation. Where available, fecal metabolomic data will be used to set boundary conditions for nutrient uptake and metabolite secretion, further grounding the model in experimental reality.
*   **Module 5: Network Analysis and Perturbation Simulation:** With the constrained community models, we will simulate metabolic activity to address our scientific questions. We will calculate pairwise metabolic exchange fluxes to construct a 'sociometabolic' network graph for each community. Graph theory methods will be used to identify keystone species, metabolic guilds (modules), and critical metabolic handoffs. To test hypotheses about system response, we will perform in-silico perturbations. Dietary shifts will be simulated by altering the nutrient composition of the input media. Antibiotic effects will be modeled by removing susceptible species from the community. The resulting changes in predicted community growth, stability, and metabolic outputs (e.g., SCFA production) will form the basis of our predictions.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Establish data acquisition and MAG recovery pipeline. Reconstruct and curate the first 500 high-quality GEMs. Develop and benchmark the community model assembly workflow. Hold the first annual in-person working group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Scale GEM reconstruction to over 1,500 species. Fully implement and validate the metatranscriptomic data integration module. Perform initial network analysis across the HMP cohort to identify core metabolic guilds. Submit the first manuscript on the methodology and model repository.
*   **Year 3:** Conduct comprehensive perturbation simulations (diet and antibiotics). Validate model predictions against longitudinal data from the HMP2 IBD cohort. Finalize and release the open-source software package. Disseminate findings through high-impact publications and presentations at international conferences. Host a training workshop for the broader community.

**Reproducibility and Training:**
All analysis workflows will be encoded in Snakemake or Nextflow, and all software will be containerized using Docker/Singularity to ensure full reproducibility. All code, models, and derived data will be shared via GitHub and public data archives (e.g., Zenodo). Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be central to this process, receiving hands-on training in data science, systems biology, and collaborative research through bi-weekly project meetings and intensive annual hackathons.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This working group will generate significant and lasting contributions that advance the molecular and cellular sciences by providing a novel, mechanistic framework for understanding emergence in complex biological systems. The impact will span conceptual, methodological, and translational domains, directly addressing the core goals of the NCEMS research call.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Conceptual Shift from Correlation to Causation:** Our primary contribution will be to move the field of microbiome research beyond descriptive, correlational studies. By creating a predictive, mechanism-based model of the gut ecosystem, we will provide a powerful tool for testing causal hypotheses about how microbial community structure leads to emergent function. This will establish a new paradigm for studying host-microbe systems, grounded in the principles of systems biology and ecological theory.
2.  **A Novel, Open-Source Analytical Platform:** We will deliver a fully documented, open-source computational pipeline for building multi-omic-constrained community metabolic models. This platform will be a valuable resource for the entire research community, enabling other scientists to apply our methods to their own data and questions, thus democratizing this powerful analytical approach.
3.  **The Most Comprehensive Gut Microbial Metabolic Resource:** We will produce and publicly release the largest, most highly curated database of genome-scale metabolic models for human gut microbes, many derived from previously uncultured MAGs. This 'Sociomicrobiology Model Kit' will be an invaluable standalone resource, accelerating research in microbial physiology, synthetic biology, and drug discovery.
4.  **Discovery of Fundamental Organizing Principles:** Our analysis will uncover the fundamental 'rules' of metabolic organization in the gut. We will identify conserved metabolic guilds, quantify the importance of functional redundancy for ecosystem stability, and pinpoint keystone species and metabolites that are critical control points in the system. These discoveries will provide a new, function-centric roadmap of the gut ecosystem.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Translational Medicine and Personalized Nutrition:** The predictive power of our models has direct translational potential. They can serve as the foundation for developing personalized interventions. For example, a clinician could use a patient's microbiome data to run in-silico simulations to predict which specific prebiotic fiber would most effectively increase their butyrate production, or to design a probiotic consortium to restore a missing metabolic function. This represents a critical step towards the rational engineering of the microbiome for therapeutic purposes.
*   **Drug Development and Toxicology:** Our models can be used as an in-silico platform to screen for off-target effects of new drug candidates on the gut microbiome. By simulating the inhibition of microbial enzymes targeted by a drug, we can predict potential disruptions to the gut ecosystem, potentially reducing adverse effects and improving drug safety profiles.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** This project is intrinsically designed to train a new generation of data-savvy biologists. Trainees will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary skills at the intersection of microbiology, computational biology, and data science. The collaborative, team-science environment fostered by the working group will prepare them for the future of large-scale, integrative biological research.

**Dissemination and Sustainability:**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-pronged. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals (e.g., *Nature Biotechnology*, *Cell Host & Microbe*, *PLOS Computational Biology*). We will actively present our work at major international conferences (e.g., ISMB, ISME, Keystone Symposia). Crucially, all code, models, and workflows will be made publicly available via GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR data principles. To ensure long-term impact, we will host a training workshop in the final year to disseminate our tools and techniques to the broader community. The collaborative network established by this working group will be self-sustaining, serving as a nucleus for future collaborative grant proposals (e.g., NIH U01s, NSF Biology Integration Institutes) to experimentally validate model predictions and expand the model to include host-microbe metabolic interactions. Our long-term vision is to create a 'digital twin' of the gut microbiome, a tool that will transform basic research and clinical practice. This project lays the essential foundation for that vision.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_06,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,Cracking the Splicing Code: A Deep Learning Approach to the Emergence of Proteomic Diversity,"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA allows a limited number of genes to produce a vast repertoire of protein isoforms, a key source of biological complexity. The 'splicing code' that governs this process—the set of rules by which cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) guide the spliceosome to generate tissue-specific isoform patterns—remains elusive. This working group will tackle this grand challenge by treating the splicing code as a language to be learned from data. We will synthesize petabytes of public data, including: 1) RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and single-cell atlases to quantify isoform expression across thousands of samples; 2) eCLIP-seq data from ENCODE to map RBP binding sites; and 3) RNA structure probing data to understand the role of local RNA conformation. Our team, bringing together RNA biologists, computational linguists, and machine learning experts, will develop and train a novel deep learning architecture, inspired by large language models like transformers. This model will learn the complex, combinatorial grammar of splicing directly from DNA/RNA sequence and the cellular context of RBP expression. The ultimate goal is a predictive tool that, given a gene sequence and a cell type, can accurately predict the resulting mRNA isoforms. This would revolutionize our ability to interpret genetic variants affecting splicing in disease and understand the emergence of proteomic diversity.",,"Background And Significance

The central dogma of molecular biology, while foundational, belies the immense complexity that emerges from a finite set of genes. The discovery that the human genome contains only ~20,000 protein-coding genes, a number comparable to that of the nematode C. elegans, presented a profound puzzle: how does this limited genetic toolkit generate the vast phenotypic complexity of human biology? The answer, in large part, lies in alternative splicing (AS), a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism by which exons from a single pre-mRNA transcript are differentially joined. This process, occurring in over 95% of human multi-exon genes, generates a multiplicity of mRNA isoforms from a single gene, which are then translated into distinct protein variants, dramatically expanding the proteomic landscape. This proteomic diversity is fundamental to cellular differentiation, tissue identity, and developmental programs. The rules governing this process, collectively termed the 'splicing code,' remain one of the great unsolved problems in molecular biology. Unlike the triplet-based genetic code, the splicing code is a complex, combinatorial, and context-dependent language. It is written in the sequence of the pre-mRNA itself, in the form of cis-regulatory elements such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers (ESEs, ESSs, ISEs, ISSs). This code is read and interpreted by a dynamic cohort of trans-acting factors, primarily RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which bind to these cis-elements and guide the core spliceosome machinery to select specific splice sites. The combinatorial binding of dozens to hundreds of RBPs creates a regulatory logic of staggering complexity, enabling the precise tuning of isoform ratios in a cell-type-specific and condition-dependent manner. Early efforts to decipher this code focused on identifying short, consensus sequence motifs for splice sites and regulatory elements. While informative, these approaches failed to capture the combinatorial nature and long-range interactions inherent to splicing regulation. The advent of high-throughput sequencing has provided an unprecedented wealth of data. Large-scale projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project have generated massive public datasets, including transcriptomes from thousands of human samples (RNA-seq), and genome-wide binding maps for hundreds of RBPs (eCLIP-seq). These resources have fueled the development of computational models to predict splicing outcomes. Initial machine learning models, such as those based on support vector machines or random forests, demonstrated some success but were limited by their inability to learn complex sequence features automatically. More recently, deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has shown significant promise. Models like SpliceAI can accurately predict if a genetic variant will disrupt a splice site, a major step forward for clinical genetics. However, significant gaps remain. Current models struggle to predict quantitative isoform ratios (i.e., the Percent Spliced In, or PSI value) across diverse cellular contexts. They often fail to integrate the crucial context of trans-acting RBP expression levels and do not adequately model the long-range dependencies between distal regulatory elements, which can be kilobases apart. Furthermore, the role of local RNA secondary structure, known to influence RBP binding and splice site accessibility, is frequently ignored. We are at a critical juncture where the confluence of massive, multimodal public datasets and revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), makes it possible to address these limitations. Transformers, with their self-attention mechanism, are uniquely suited to learning the long-range, contextual 'grammar' of complex sequential data. This project is therefore timely and important, proposing to synthesize these disparate data modalities within a novel LLM-inspired framework to finally crack the splicing code. Success will not only represent a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of gene regulation but will also provide a powerful tool to interpret genetic disease and engineer RNA-based therapeutics.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this working group is to develop and validate a comprehensive, predictive model of alternative splicing, named 'SpliceFormer,' that can accurately predict tissue-specific isoform ratios from genomic sequence and cellular context. By treating the splicing code as a formal language, we aim to decipher its grammar and uncover the emergent principles that govern proteomic diversity. To achieve this, we will address three central research questions, each associated with specific, testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: Can a transformer-based deep learning architecture effectively learn the complex, combinatorial, and long-range grammar of the splicing code from integrated multi-modal public data?**
This question addresses the core technical challenge of building a model capable of understanding the intricate rules of splicing. We hypothesize that the limitations of previous models stem from their inability to capture the full complexity of the input data.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A deep learning model built upon a transformer architecture will significantly outperform current state-of-the-art models (e.g., CNN-based architectures like SpliceAI) in the quantitative prediction of isoform ratios (PSI values) across diverse human tissues. We predict this is because the self-attention mechanism inherent to transformers can model dependencies between regulatory elements and splice sites separated by thousands of nucleotides, a known feature of splicing regulation that is poorly captured by local-feature-focused CNNs.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** Explicitly conditioning the model on the cellular context, defined by the expression profile of key RBPs and splicing factors, will be essential for achieving tissue-specific predictive accuracy. We hypothesize that a model receiving only DNA/RNA sequence as input will predict a generic splicing outcome, while a model provided with the trans-acting factor milieu will correctly predict tissue-specific isoform switches.
*   **Hypothesis 1c:** The integration of RNA secondary structure information as an additional input modality will further refine model predictions. We hypothesize that for a specific subset of splicing events known to be regulated by RNA structure, incorporating this information will correct prediction errors made by a structure-agnostic model.
*   **Validation:** These hypotheses will be tested by systematically training and evaluating model variants. We will compare the performance (e.g., Pearson correlation between predicted and observed PSI) of our full SpliceFormer model against baseline CNNs and ablated versions of our own model (e.g., without the transformer layers, without RBP context, without structure data) on a held-out test set of genes and tissues from the GTEx project.

**Research Question 2: What are the key cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factor combinations that define tissue-specific splicing programs?**
Beyond prediction, our goal is to extract biological knowledge from the trained model. We aim to use the model as an in silico laboratory to probe the mechanisms of splicing regulation.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Model interpretation techniques, specifically in silico saturation mutagenesis, will identify the precise nucleotide-level functional impact of cis-regulatory sequences, allowing for the de novo discovery of novel splicing enhancers and silencers with higher accuracy than motif-based searches.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** Analysis of the model's internal mechanisms, such as its attention maps and feature importance scores (e.g., SHAP values), will reveal the 'grammar' of splicing regulation, including synergistic and antagonistic interactions between RBPs that govern specific splicing decisions. For example, we hypothesize we can identify specific RBP combinations that define brain-specific versus muscle-specific exon inclusion patterns.
*   **Validation:** Cis-element predictions will be validated by comparing our functional scores with large-scale experimental data from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and known pathogenic splicing mutations from databases like ClinVar. Predicted RBP interactions will be cross-referenced with protein-protein interaction databases and co-localization patterns from ENCODE eCLIP-seq data.

**Research Question 3: How does the splicing code drive the emergence of cellular identity and how is it perturbed in human disease?**
This question seeks to apply our validated model to address fundamental questions in cell biology and translational medicine.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The SpliceFormer model can accurately predict the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variants on splicing, enabling the systematic prioritization of disease-causing variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** By applying the model to single-cell RNA-seq data, we can map the dynamic landscape of splicing regulation during cellular differentiation and identify critical splicing 'switches' that are necessary for cell fate decisions.
*   **Validation:** We will use SpliceFormer to score all common variants in the human genome for their predicted effect on splicing. These scores will be tested for enrichment in GWAS loci for various diseases. For single-cell applications, we will apply the model to public datasets of hematopoiesis or neurogenesis and validate predicted splicing switches against known lineage-defining isoform changes in the literature.

**Deliverables:** The expected outcomes include: (1) The open-source SpliceFormer software package and pre-trained models; (2) A public web portal for predicting splicing outcomes; (3) A comprehensive atlas of predicted functional cis-elements and RBP regulatory networks across human tissues; and (4) High-impact publications detailing the model and its biological insights.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in RNA biology, machine learning, computational linguistics, and bioinformatics. The collaborative structure is essential for integrating the diverse datasets and developing a conceptually novel modeling approach. The research plan is organized into three synergistic aims, with a detailed timeline and milestones.

**Aim 1: Curation and Synthesis of a Multi-modal Splicing Data Compendium.**
The foundation of our project is the large-scale integration of publicly available data. This task requires a robust, reproducible data processing pipeline managed by a dedicated data scientist within the team.
*   **Transcriptomic Data:** We will utilize the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (v8), which contains over 17,000 RNA-seq datasets from 54 human tissues. Raw data will be re-processed through a uniform pipeline using STAR for alignment and rMATS for the robust identification and quantification of alternative splicing events (e.g., skipped exons, mutually exclusive exons), yielding Percent Spliced In (PSI) values. This will form our primary training and testing dataset. Additionally, we will integrate data from single-cell atlases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas) to derive cell-type-specific RBP expression profiles and validate model predictions at higher resolution.
*   **RBP Binding Data:** We will leverage the ENCODE project's comprehensive collection of enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP-seq) datasets, covering over 150 RBPs. Uniformly processed peak data will be mapped to pre-mRNA coordinates to create a high-resolution map of RBP-RNA interactions. For tissues lacking direct eCLIP data, we will develop an imputation model that predicts RBP binding probability based on local sequence motifs and the RBP's expression level in that tissue.
*   **RNA Structure Data:** We will incorporate data from in vivo structure probing experiments (e.g., SHAPE-MaP, DMS-seq). These datasets provide nucleotide-resolution information on RNA secondary structure. We will process these data to generate a probability track for each nucleotide being in a paired or unpaired state, which will serve as an input channel to our model.
*   **Genomic and Annotation Data:** The human reference genome (GRCh38) and GENCODE gene annotations will provide the scaffold for all data integration.

**Aim 2: Development and Training of the SpliceFormer Model.**
This aim constitutes the core technical innovation of the proposal, led by our machine learning experts with guidance from computational linguists on architectural design.
*   **Input Representation:** For each splicing event, the model will receive a multi-channel input tensor. This includes: (1) The one-hot encoded DNA sequence of the target exon and ~1kb of flanking intronic sequence on each side; (2) A parallel vector representing RNA secondary structure probabilities; and (3) A concatenated 'context vector' containing the normalized expression values (TPM) of ~200 key RBPs and splicing factors for the specific tissue sample.
*   **Model Architecture:** The SpliceFormer architecture will consist of three main components. First, a set of convolutional layers will scan the sequence and structure inputs to learn low-level features like splice sites and RBP binding motifs. Second, the output of the convolutional layers will be fed into a multi-head self-attention Transformer encoder. This core component will learn the long-range dependencies and combinatorial relationships between all features in the sequence. Third, the tissue-specific RBP context vector will be integrated using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer, which allows the trans-acting factor profile to dynamically gate the flow of information through the network. The final layers will be a multi-layer perceptron that outputs a single value, the predicted PSI.
*   **Training, Validation, and Benchmarking:** The curated GTEx dataset will be split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets, ensuring no gene overlap. The model will be trained on a distributed GPU cluster using the Adam optimizer and a mean squared error loss function. We will perform extensive hyperparameter tuning. The final model's performance will be rigorously benchmarked against existing methods, including SpliceAI and other CNN-based models, on the held-out test set.

**Aim 3: Model Interpretation, Biological Discovery, and Dissemination.**
Once trained, the model will be used as a tool for biological discovery, led by the RNA biologists in the team.
*   **Interpretation Techniques:** We will employ a suite of interpretation methods. In silico saturation mutagenesis will be performed by systematically mutating every position in a sequence and recording the predicted change in PSI, generating high-resolution functional maps. We will visualize the transformer's attention maps to identify which distal elements the model uses to make predictions for a given splice site. Feature attribution methods like SHAP will be used to determine the relative importance of specific RBPs for splicing decisions in different tissues.
*   **Web Portal and Open Science:** To ensure broad utility, we will develop a user-friendly web portal where researchers can submit a gene and select a tissue context to receive splicing predictions and visualizations. All code will be made available on GitHub under a permissive license, and all processed data and trained models will be deposited in public repositories like Zenodo, adhering to FAIR data principles.

**Timeline:**
*   **Year 1:** Data aggregation, processing pipeline finalization, and initial model prototyping. First annual working group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Full-scale model training, hyperparameter optimization, rigorous benchmarking, and initial interpretation analyses. Development of the web portal begins.
*   **Year 3:** In-depth biological discovery using the model, application to disease variant and single-cell data, manuscript preparation, and public release of all tools and resources. Final working group meeting and community training workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of molecular biology, computational biology, and translational medicine. The impact will be felt through the creation of a paradigm-shifting predictive tool, the generation of a foundational biological resource, and the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field:**
The primary outcome will be the **SpliceFormer model**, a powerful, publicly accessible tool that represents a fundamental leap forward in our ability to understand and predict gene regulation. Unlike previous models, SpliceFormer will be the first to integrate sequence, RNA structure, and the trans-acting cellular environment to predict quantitative, tissue-specific splicing outcomes. This moves the field beyond simple classification of splice sites towards a truly quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the process. The conceptual framing of the splicing code as a 'language' to be learned by a transformer architecture is a novel approach that could serve as a blueprint for modeling other complex biological systems.

A second major outcome will be the creation of a **comprehensive, dynamic atlas of the human splicing code**. Through in silico mutagenesis and model interpretation, we will generate the most detailed map to date of functional cis-regulatory elements across the entire human transcriptome. Crucially, this map will be dynamic, showing how the activity of these elements is modulated by the combinatorial interplay of RBPs across dozens of human tissues. This atlas will serve as a foundational resource for RNA biologists for years to come, enabling countless new hypotheses about gene regulation in health and disease.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The societal and clinical impact of this research will be substantial.
*   **Revolutionizing Clinical Genetics:** A major challenge in genomics is the interpretation of variants of unknown significance (VUS), particularly those in non-coding regions. SpliceFormer will provide a powerful tool to predict whether any given genetic variant disrupts splicing, providing a direct mechanistic link to disease. This will aid in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders and improve the clinical utility of whole-genome sequencing.
*   **Accelerating Therapeutic Development:** The model will have direct applications in the design of RNA-targeted therapies. For diseases caused by mis-splicing, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy or certain cancers, SpliceFormer can be used to design and optimize antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that correct the splicing defect. It can predict both on-target efficacy and potential off-target effects, streamlining the pre-clinical development pipeline.
*   **Enabling Advances in Synthetic Biology:** A predictive understanding of the splicing code will allow for the forward engineering of genetic constructs with precisely controlled, cell-type-specific splicing patterns. This will be invaluable for creating sophisticated gene circuits for applications in cell-based therapies, regenerative medicine, and biotechnology.

**Dissemination, Open Science, and Training:**
This working group is deeply committed to the principles of open and reproducible science. All software developed will be open-source and hosted on GitHub. All data, model weights, and results will be shared through public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, GEO) and a dedicated project website. Findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. To maximize community engagement, we will host a final-year workshop to train other researchers in the use of our tools. This project is an ideal training environment for graduate students and postdocs, who will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary experience at the cutting edge of big data, machine learning, and molecular biology, directly addressing the call's goal of fostering a data-savvy workforce.

**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**
The long-term vision is to establish SpliceFormer as a 'foundation model' for RNA processing, analogous to what AlphaFold has become for protein structure. The framework we develop is extensible and can be adapted in future work to incorporate other layers of gene regulation, such as transcription kinetics, chromatin state, and polyadenylation. This project will not only answer a long-standing fundamental question but will also lay the groundwork for a new era of predictive, personalized genomics.

Budget And Resources

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_07,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Phase-Separation Atlas: Predicting the Emergence of Membraneless Organelles from Proteome-wide Features,"Cells organize their cytoplasm using not only membrane-bound organelles but also membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates, which form via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The composition, regulation, and material properties of these condensates are emergent phenomena driven by multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids. This working group will develop a predictive framework to map the 'phase-separation potential' of the entire human proteome. We will synthesize diverse public datasets, including protein sequences from UniProt, structural disorder predictions, post-translational modification sites, and protein-protein interaction networks from STRING and BioGRID. These data will be used to train machine learning models, benchmarked against curated experimental databases of phase-separating proteins (e.g., PhaSepDB, PhaSePro). Our multidisciplinary team of cell biologists, polymer physicists, biophysicists, and data scientists will develop a multi-scale model that predicts not only the intrinsic LLPS propensity of individual proteins but also the combinatorial logic of how these proteins assemble into specific, compositionally distinct condensates. The project will deliver a publicly accessible, interactive 'Phase-Separation Atlas' that predicts which proteins form condensates, with whom they interact, and how disease-associated mutations or post-translational modifications might alter these emergent cellular structures. This will provide a powerful resource for understanding cellular organization and the molecular basis of diseases like neurodegeneration and cancer.",,"Background And Significance

The textbook view of cellular organization, dominated by membrane-enclosed compartments, has been fundamentally expanded by the discovery of membraneless organelles (MLOs). These dynamic, protein- and RNA-rich bodies, also known as biomolecular condensates, are critical hubs for biochemical reactions and information processing, including stress response, RNA metabolism, and ribosome biogenesis. The formation of these MLOs is an emergent property of the system, driven by a physical process known as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This process is governed by the collective effect of many weak, multivalent interactions among macromolecules, primarily proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and nucleic acids. Seminal work by Brangwynne, Hyman, Rosen, Pappu, and others has established the physicochemical principles of LLPS, demonstrating how specific sequence features—such as charge patterning, aromatic residues, and low-complexity domains—can encode the potential for a protein to phase separate. This paradigm shift has profound implications, as the material properties and composition of condensates are not fixed but are dynamically regulated by the cell, and their dysregulation is increasingly linked to devastating human diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and various cancers. The field has rapidly advanced from descriptive cell biology to quantitative biophysics, yet a critical gap remains in our ability to predict and understand phase separation at a proteome-wide scale. Current experimental methods for identifying phase-separating proteins are low-throughput and often performed in vitro, divorced from the complex cellular milieu. While several computational tools have emerged to predict LLPS propensity from protein sequence (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE, FuzDrop), they face significant limitations. First, they primarily focus on the intrinsic properties of individual proteins, often overlooking the combinatorial logic of how multiple components assemble into a specific, functional condensate. Cellular LLPS is not a solo act; it is a collective, emergent phenomenon. Second, existing models often rely on a limited set of sequence features and have not fully leveraged the explosion of structural, post-translational, and network-level data. Third, they lack the capacity to systematically predict how cellular context, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) or the presence of specific RNA molecules, tunes phase behavior. Consequently, we lack a comprehensive 'parts list' of the human condensatome, let alone the 'assembly instructions' that govern its formation, composition, and regulation. There is no integrated resource that allows a researcher to query a protein and predict not only if it can phase separate, but with which partners, under what conditions, and how this behavior might be altered by a disease-associated mutation. This project is both important and timely because it addresses this critical gap directly. The unprecedented availability of high-quality public data—from proteome sequences (UniProt), interaction networks (STRING, BioGRID), predicted structures (AlphaFold DB), and clinical variants (ClinVar)—provides a historic opportunity for a large-scale data synthesis effort. By convening a multidisciplinary working group of cell biologists, polymer physicists, and data scientists, we can integrate these disparate datasets to build a predictive model of cellular organization that is far beyond the scope of any single research lab. This project will transform our understanding of the emergent principles governing cellular compartmentalization and provide an invaluable resource to accelerate research into the molecular basis of health and disease.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is motivated by the central question: Can we move beyond predicting the intrinsic LLPS propensity of individual proteins to create a multi-scale, predictive framework that maps the emergent, combinatorial logic of the entire human condensatome? To address this overarching goal, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses that will guide our data synthesis and modeling efforts. 

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): What are the universal and context-specific molecular features that determine a protein's intrinsic capacity to undergo LLPS and how is this capacity regulated?**
While current predictors identify some key features, they lack the sophistication to capture the full regulatory grammar encoded in protein sequence, structure, and modification state. We hypothesize that a more comprehensive integration of features within an advanced machine learning framework will yield a superior predictive model.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A deep learning model that integrates a rich feature set—including amino acid n-gram frequencies, physicochemical properties (e.g., sequence charge decoration), predicted structural motifs from AlphaFold, and consensus disorder predictions—will significantly outperform existing algorithms in predicting the intrinsic LLPS propensity of a protein when benchmarked against curated experimental databases.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** Post-translational modifications (PTMs) function as a dynamic regulatory code that systematically tunes LLPS. We hypothesize that specific PTMs, such as phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues or arginine methylation, predictably alter a protein's phase diagram by modifying its net charge, valency, and interaction surfaces. Our model will be trained to predict the direction and magnitude of this effect.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): How do multivalent interactions among proteins and with RNA molecules specify the composition and identity of distinct biomolecular condensates?**
An individual protein's LLPS propensity is necessary but not sufficient to explain the formation of specific MLOs. We posit that condensate identity emerges from the underlying network of molecular interactions.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** The architecture of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, when weighted by the intrinsic LLPS scores of its constituent proteins (from RQ1), contains modules that correspond to known biomolecular condensates. We predict that community detection algorithms will identify distinct protein clusters, each defined by a core of high-propensity 'scaffold' proteins and a periphery of lower-propensity 'client' proteins, which recapitulate the known compositions of organelles like stress granules, P-bodies, and the nucleolus.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** Specific RNA molecules, particularly long non-coding RNAs, act as essential architectural elements for a subset of condensates. We hypothesize that integrating protein-RNA interaction data will reveal that certain RNAs serve as critical hubs, scaffolding specific protein communities and thereby defining the condensate's ultimate composition and function.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How do disease-associated genetic mutations perturb the proteome's phase-separation landscape, leading to cellular dysfunction?**
The link between aberrant phase transitions and disease is well-established, but a systematic method to predict the impact of mutations is lacking. We hypothesize that our framework can mechanistically stratify mutations based on their predicted effect on LLPS.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** Pathogenic missense mutations found in databases like ClinVar, when mapped onto proteins with high predicted LLPS propensity, will disproportionately alter key physicochemical features governing multivalency (e.g., charge, aromaticity, disorder) compared to benign polymorphisms from gnomAD.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** Our integrated model can predict the functional consequence of a mutation, classifying it as gain-of-function (e.g., promoting aggregation and solidification, as seen in FUS/TDP-43), loss-of-function (e.g., disrupting necessary condensate formation), or neutral. This predictive capability will provide a powerful tool for interpreting variants of unknown significance.

Our primary deliverable will be the 'Phase-Separation Atlas,' a public web resource integrating these predictive tiers. Validation will be computational, using rigorous cross-validation, testing on held-out datasets not used for training, and benchmarking against orthogonal evidence from proteomics studies of purified MLOs.

Methods And Approach

This project is designed as a community-scale synthesis effort, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group, which includes cell biologists, biophysicists, polymer physicists, data scientists, and software engineers. Our approach is organized into three synergistic aims, built upon a foundational data integration platform. The entire project will adhere to open science principles, with all data, code, and models made publicly available.

**Foundational Step: Data Acquisition, Harmonization, and Integration**
Our first task is to construct a comprehensive, multi-modal knowledge graph. This involves aggregating and harmonizing data from numerous public repositories. 
*   **Data Sources:** We will use the human proteome from UniProt/Swiss-Prot as our base. This will be annotated with: (1) sequence-derived features; (2) consensus disorder predictions from MobiDB; (3) predicted 3D structures from the AlphaFold Database; (4) experimentally verified PTMs from PhosphoSitePlus; (5) high-confidence PPIs from STRING and BioGRID; (6) protein-RNA interactions from ENCODE and starBase; and (7) human genetic variants from ClinVar, COSMIC, and gnomAD. For model training and benchmarking, we will compile a gold-standard set of LLPS-positive and -negative proteins from PhaSepDB, PhaSePro, and extensive manual literature curation.
*   **Integration:** All data will be mapped to unique UniProt identifiers and stored in a Neo4j graph database. This structure is ideal for representing the complex, multi-layered relationships between proteins, RNAs, PTMs, and their emergent properties.

**Aim 1: Developing a State-of-the-Art Predictor for Intrinsic LLPS Propensity**
To address RQ1, we will develop a machine learning model to compute a continuous LLPS score for every protein in the human proteome.
*   **Feature Engineering:** For each protein, we will compute a rich vector of over 200 features, including amino acid composition, sequence complexity, charge patterning (e.g., SCD, κ), hydrophobicity, aromatic residue content, and predicted structural features like coil/helix content and solvent accessibility derived from AlphaFold models.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will employ a transformer-based architecture, which excels at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. This model will be trained on our gold-standard dataset to predict LLPS propensity. Its performance will be rigorously compared against simpler models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) and existing tools using 10-fold cross-validation and testing on a held-out set of recently published LLPS proteins.
*   **PTM Modeling:** We will simulate the effect of common PTMs by altering the feature vector (e.g., phosphorylation adds two negative charges and a bulky group) and predicting the resulting change in the LLPS score, thereby quantifying the regulatory potential of each modification.

**Aim 2: Mapping the Condensatome through Network Analysis**
To address RQ2, we will use the LLPS scores from Aim 1 to analyze the human interactome.
*   **Network Construction:** We will construct a weighted human PPI network where nodes are proteins and edges represent high-confidence interactions. Each node will be annotated with its intrinsic LLPS score.
*   **Community Detection:** We will apply network clustering algorithms (e.g., Louvain method) to identify densely interconnected modules. Our central hypothesis is that modules with a high average LLPS score represent protein communities that co-assemble into specific condensates. We will validate these predicted communities by testing for enrichment of proteins known to co-localize in specific MLOs using GO terms and other annotation databases.
*   **RNA Scaffolding:** We will extend this network by adding RNA nodes and protein-RNA edges. This will allow us to identify RNAs that act as hubs or bridges, organizing specific protein communities into functional ribonucleoprotein granules.

**Aim 3: Building and Disseminating the Interactive Phase-Separation Atlas**
To address RQ3 and serve the broader community, we will create a user-friendly web portal.
*   **Backend/Frontend:** A RESTful API will provide access to our integrated database and predictive models. The frontend will be developed using React and D3.js for interactive data visualization.
*   **Functionality:** The Atlas will allow users to: (1) search for any human protein and view its predicted LLPS score and key driving features; (2) explore its predicted condensate partners in an interactive network view; (3) visualize a 'mutability map' highlighting residues where mutations are predicted to most strongly impact LLPS; and (4) input specific mutations (e.g., from clinical sequencing) to get a prediction of their impact on phase separation.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Data integration complete. Version 1.0 of the intrinsic LLPS predictor developed and benchmarked. First annual working group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Network-based condensate prediction model complete. Beta version of the Phase-Separation Atlas web portal released for community feedback. Training workshop for trainees.
*   **Year 3:** Full integration of all predictive tiers. Public launch of the Atlas. Systematic analysis of disease mutations. Final working group meeting and submission of primary manuscript.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will yield significant outcomes that will fundamentally advance the molecular and cellular biosciences, with broad impacts on human health research. Our work is designed to create not just new knowledge, but also enduring resources that will catalyze research across the scientific community, perfectly aligning with the mission of this funding organization.

**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field:**
This project will deliver the first comprehensive, multi-scale predictive map of the human condensatome. Our primary intellectual contribution is the shift from a reductionist, single-protein view of phase separation to a systems-level, emergent framework. By integrating sequence, structure, PTMs, and interaction networks, we will elucidate the combinatorial 'code' that governs the assembly of membraneless organelles. This will provide a quantitative, mechanistic foundation for understanding how cells use phase separation to organize their cytoplasm. We will generate a ranked and prioritized list of hundreds of novel candidate LLPS proteins, providing a rich set of experimentally testable hypotheses for the broader cell biology community. Furthermore, our framework for predicting the functional consequences of mutations will establish a new paradigm for interpreting genetic variation in the context of cellular organization.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Disease Research:** The Phase-Separation Atlas will be an invaluable hypothesis-generation tool. A researcher studying a protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease, ALS, or a specific cancer can immediately use our resource to assess its likelihood of phase separation, identify its potential interaction partners within a condensate, and predict how patient-derived mutations might alter its behavior. This will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for studying LLPS and guide experimental design, saving time and resources.
*   **Informing Therapeutic Strategies:** By identifying the key 'scaffold' proteins that nucleate specific disease-relevant condensates and the critical interactions that maintain them, the Atlas will highlight novel targets for therapeutic intervention. This could inspire strategies aimed at dissolving pathological aggregates or restoring the function of essential condensates.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This project is intrinsically a training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs within the working group will gain unique cross-disciplinary expertise at the interface of cell biology, biophysics, and machine learning. Through our planned annual workshops, we will disseminate these skills and our analytical pipelines to the wider community, fostering a more computationally fluent workforce.

**Dissemination, Data Sharing, and Long-Term Vision:**
We are deeply committed to open science principles. 
*   **The Phase-Separation Atlas:** Our primary deliverable will be a freely accessible, user-friendly web portal. We will secure institutional commitments to maintain this resource for at least five years beyond the funding period.

We will build it with the capacity for future updates, allowing for the integration of new experimental data and model refinement over time. This project will not only answer our proposed research questions but will also create a powerful, extensible platform that empowers the entire scientific community to explore the emergent world of biomolecular condensates.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale, multidisciplinary synthesis effort that requires a dedicated team and significant computational resources, far exceeding the capacity of a single research laboratory or existing collaboration. The budget is designed to support a highly collaborative and trainee-focused working group, ensuring the successful execution of the project and the dissemination of its outcomes. The total requested budget for the three-year project is $XXX,XXX.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_08,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Digital Cell: Unifying Image and Omics Data to Model the Emergence of Cellular Morphology,"A cell's shape and internal organization are fundamental to its function, yet they are emergent properties arising from staggeringly complex interactions between the cytoskeleton, membranes, and organelles. Understanding how morphology is robustly encoded and dynamically regulated requires a holistic, quantitative approach. This working group proposes to build a 'digital twin' of a human cell by integrating public data from two powerful but often disconnected domains: imaging and omics. We will synthesize 3D live-cell imaging data from resources like the Allen Cell Explorer and the Image Data Resource, which contain terabytes of high-resolution movies of fluorescently-tagged structures. We will combine this with proteomics, transcriptomics, and protein-protein interaction data that define the molecular parts list and their connections. Our team, uniting cell biologists, computer vision experts, biophysicists, and applied mathematicians, will develop novel deep learning algorithms to automatically extract a 'morphological feature space' from thousands of images. We will then build an integrated computational model that links these morphological features to the underlying molecular networks. The goal is to create a predictive model that can simulate how cellular morphology emerges from molecular-level rules and how it changes in response to genetic perturbations cataloged in resources like the DepMap. This will provide an unprecedented platform for understanding the principles of cellular self-organization.",,"Background And Significance

The principle that structure dictates function is a cornerstone of biology. At the cellular level, this principle manifests in the intricate and dynamic morphology of the cell—its overall shape, the spatial organization of its organelles, and the architecture of its cytoskeleton. These are not static, pre-programmed structures but emergent properties arising from the collective behavior of millions of molecules. Understanding how a cell’s genotype and molecular state translate into its physical phenotype is one of the most fundamental, long-standing challenges in molecular and cellular science. For decades, research has progressed along two parallel, powerful, but largely disconnected tracks: the visual and the molecular. The imaging revolution, driven by advances like lattice light-sheet and spinning-disk confocal microscopy, has provided breathtaking views into the living cell. Large-scale public repositories such as the Allen Cell Explorer and the Image Data Resource (IDR) now house petabytes of high-resolution, three-dimensional movies, cataloging the localization and dynamics of thousands of proteins. These resources offer an unprecedented visual encyclopedia of cellular organization. Concurrently, the omics revolution has provided a comprehensive 'parts list' and 'wiring diagram' of the cell. Projects like the Human Proteome Map, STRING, and BioGRID have systematically cataloged protein abundances and their physical interactions, while resources like GTEx and ENCODE have mapped the transcriptional landscape. Furthermore, large-scale perturbation screens, most notably the Dependency Map (DepMap), have functionally linked thousands of genes to cellular fitness and other phenotypes through systematic CRISPR and RNAi screens. The critical gap in our knowledge lies at the intersection of these two domains. We have a wealth of data on what the cell looks like and what it is made of, but we lack a quantitative, predictive framework that connects the molecular 'wiring diagram' to the emergent physical form. Current computational models in cell biology are often focused on specific subsystems, such as actin polymerization or mitotic spindle assembly. While incredibly insightful, these models do not capture the holistic, cell-wide coordination that governs overall morphology. The analysis of large-scale imaging data often relies on a limited set of pre-defined, 'hand-crafted' features (e.g., cell area, nuclear eccentricity), which may miss subtle or complex aspects of cellular organization. We are at a unique inflection point where this grand challenge can finally be addressed. The confluence of three key developments makes this project both timely and feasible: the maturity of massive, public imaging and omics datasets; the dramatic advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning for automated feature extraction from complex images; and the growing culture of collaborative, open team science. This working group proposes to bridge the gap between the molecular and the morphological by synthesizing these disparate public data streams. By developing a unified computational framework, we will move beyond correlative studies to build a predictive model of cellular self-organization. This 'Digital Cell' will serve as a powerful, community-accessible platform to perform in silico experiments, generating testable hypotheses about how molecular perturbations impact the physical structure of the cell. This research directly addresses the funding call's focus on emergence phenomena, leveraging data synthesis and multidisciplinary collaboration to solve a foundational puzzle in cellular bioscience.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group will address the overarching question: How do the collective interactions of a cell's molecular components robustly encode and dynamically regulate its three-dimensional morphology? To deconstruct this complex problem, we have formulated three specific, interconnected aims, each with a central research question and a testable hypothesis. Our approach is designed to create a hierarchical framework, starting with a quantitative description of morphology, then linking it to the underlying molecular state, and finally using this link for prediction.

**Aim 1: Define a comprehensive, quantitative 'morphospace' of the human cell.**
*   **Research Question 1:** Can we develop a unified, low-dimensional feature space that captures the salient morphological variations across thousands of live-cell 3D images, encompassing cell shape, organelle organization, and cytoskeletal architecture, without relying on biased, manually engineered features?
*   **Hypothesis 1:** A deep generative model, specifically a 3D Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), trained on a large corpus of 3D cell images, can learn a continuous, compressed latent representation (the 'morphospace'). We hypothesize that this learned space will be more powerful than traditional feature sets because it will capture complex, multi-scale relationships between subcellular structures. Proximity within this space will correspond to holistic morphological similarity.
*   **Validation:** The validity of the morphospace will be tested rigorously. First, the CVAE's decoder must be able to reconstruct high-fidelity cell images from latent space vectors, demonstrating that the representation is comprehensive. Second, we will test if the space is biologically meaningful by projecting cells with known phenotypes (e.g., cells in different phases of the cell cycle) into the space and verifying that they form distinct, separable clusters. Third, we will perform interpolations between distant points in the morphospace and show, through visual inspection by expert cell biologists in our team, that the generated intermediate images represent biologically plausible morphological transitions.

**Aim 2: Build a predictive model linking the molecular state (omics) to the morphological state (morphospace).**
*   **Research Question 2:** To what extent can the abundance and interaction patterns of proteins and transcripts predict a cell's position within the defined morphospace? Which molecular pathways are the primary determinants of specific morphological axes?
*   **Hypothesis 2:** A multi-modal machine learning model, integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with gene expression and protein abundance data, can accurately predict a cell's coordinates in the morphospace. We propose using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), as it is explicitly designed to learn from the relational structure of the PPI network. We hypothesize that this integrated model will outperform models based on gene expression alone, as it captures the functional context of molecular components.
*   **Validation:** We will train the model using data from sources like the Human Protein Atlas, where imaging and omics data are available for the same cell lines. The model's predictive accuracy will be assessed on a held-out test set using metrics like cosine similarity between predicted and true morphospace vectors. To identify key molecular drivers, we will employ feature attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, integrated gradients) to rank genes and pathways by their influence on different morphological axes.

**Aim 3: Use the integrated model to simulate the morphological consequences of genetic perturbations.**
*   **Research Question 3:** Can our integrated model accurately predict the specific morphological changes that result from systematic gene knockdowns or knockouts, as cataloged in large-scale public screens?
*   **Hypothesis 3:** By computationally simulating a genetic perturbation (e.g., removing a gene's node from the GNN input) and propagating this change through our trained omics-to-morphospace model, we can forecast the resulting displacement vector in morphospace. We hypothesize that these *in silico* predicted phenotypic shifts will quantitatively match experimentally observed morphological changes from high-content imaging screens.
*   **Validation:** This hypothesis will be tested directly against public data. We will use our model to predict the morphological outcomes for genes targeted in the DepMap project. These predictions will be compared to the measured morphological feature changes in corresponding high-content Cell Painting datasets. We will quantify the model's predictive power by calculating the correlation between the predicted and observed phenotypic vectors across thousands of genetic perturbations. Success in this aim will validate our model as a powerful engine for hypothesis generation.

Methods And Approach

Our project is a multi-year, multi-phase effort centered on the synthesis and modeling of public data. The methodology is designed to be modular, with clear milestones and validation steps at the conclusion of each phase. Our entire workflow will adhere to open science principles, with all code, models, and derived data being made publicly available.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase requires the expertise of our entire team to collate and standardize disparate data types. 
*   **Imaging Data Sources:** We will primarily utilize the Allen Cell Explorer dataset, which contains over 40,000 3D live-cell image sets of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with fluorescently tagged structures. This will be our core training set due to its consistency and high quality. We will supplement this with datasets from the Image Data Resource (IDR), specifically high-content screens like the Cell Painting assays, which provide morphological data linked to genetic or chemical perturbations. We will also incorporate 2D confocal images from the Human Protein Atlas to link protein localization to our model. 
*   **Omics and Perturbation Data Sources:** We will construct a comprehensive molecular interaction network using data from STRING and BioGRID. Basal gene expression and protein abundance profiles for relevant cell lines will be sourced from GTEx, CCLE, and the Human Proteome Map. For perturbation analysis, we will use the CRISPR and RNAi screening data from the DepMap project and the associated imaging phenotypes from the Broad Institute's Cell Painting datasets.
*   **Curation Pipeline:** A systematic pipeline will be developed to process these data. For images, this includes metadata standardization, intensity normalization, and segmentation of cell and nuclear boundaries using pre-trained models like Cellpose. For omics data, this involves mapping all gene/protein identifiers to a common namespace (Ensembl) and constructing a unified, weighted graph representing the molecular interaction network.

**Phase 2: Morphospace Construction via Deep Learning (Months 6-18)**
*   **Model Architecture:** We will implement a 3D Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). The encoder will consist of a series of 3D convolutional layers that downsample an input 3D image stack (e.g., 64x128x128 voxels) into a low-dimensional latent vector (e.g., 128 dimensions). The decoder will be a symmetric network of 3D transposed convolutional layers that reconstructs the image from the latent vector. The VAE framework is chosen for its ability to learn a continuous and generative latent space, which is essential for our goals of interpolation and simulation.
*   **Training and Validation:** The CVAE will be trained on the curated Allen Cell Explorer dataset using a combined loss function of reconstruction error and the Kullback-Leibler divergence to regularize the latent space. Training will be performed on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster with multiple GPUs. Validation will proceed as described in the previous section: assessing reconstruction quality, clustering of known cell states, and expert evaluation of morphological interpolations.

**Phase 3: Linking Omics to Morphospace with Graph Neural Networks (Months 15-27)**
*   **Model Architecture:** We will build a predictive model using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The input to the GNN will be our curated molecular interaction graph. Node features will include basal gene expression and protein abundance levels. The GNN will use message-passing layers to learn embeddings for each node that incorporate both its own features and the features of its network neighbors. These node embeddings will then be aggregated to produce a single graph-level embedding, which will be mapped via a multi-layer perceptron to predict the 128-dimensional morphospace vector.
*   **Training and Validation:** The model will be trained in a supervised fashion, using the morphospace vectors generated in Phase 2 as the ground truth labels for corresponding cell lines with available omics data. We will use a held-out test set and cross-validation to evaluate performance, using cosine similarity and mean squared error as our primary metrics. Feature attribution techniques (e.g., GNNExplainer) will be used to identify the molecular subnetworks most predictive of specific morphological features.

**Phase 4: In Silico Perturbation and Model Deployment (Months 24-36)**
*   **Simulation Pipeline:** We will develop a computational pipeline to simulate genetic perturbations. A gene knockout will be modeled by removing the corresponding node and its edges from the input graph fed into the trained GNN. The model will then predict the new morphospace vector. The difference between the perturbed and unperturbed vectors represents the predicted morphological phenotype.
*   **Large-Scale Validation:** We will perform thousands of these *in silico* perturbations, corresponding to the genes targeted in the DepMap screens. The predicted phenotypic vectors will be quantitatively compared to the experimental vectors derived from Cell Painting data, providing a robust, large-scale validation of our model's predictive power.
*   **Timeline and Deliverables:**
    *   **Year 1:** Complete data curation pipeline; first-generation morphospace model (CVAE) trained and validated.
    *   **Year 2:** Refined morphospace model; GNN linking model developed and trained; initial integration and validation.
    *   **Year 3:** Perturbation simulation framework finalized; large-scale validation against DepMap; public web portal for community use developed; publications and dissemination.
This project structure ensures a logical progression from data description to predictive modeling, with clear validation points that mitigate risk and ensure the robustness of our final integrated 'Digital Cell' model.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will yield significant outcomes that advance the fields of cell biology, computational biology, and data science, with broad impacts on basic research and translational medicine. The project is designed not only to answer a fundamental scientific question but also to create a lasting, extensible resource for the scientific community, perfectly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS program.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A New Paradigm for Cellular Phenotyping:** We will move the field beyond qualitative descriptions and simple scalar measurements of cell morphology. Our learned 'morphospace' will provide a holistic, quantitative, and data-driven framework for describing cellular form. This represents a fundamental shift in how cell state is defined and measured.
2.  **Solving the Genotype-Phenotype Gap:** This work will provide the first large-scale, predictive model that quantitatively links the molecular state of a cell (genotype, expression, interactions) to its emergent physical form (phenotype). This directly addresses the long-standing puzzle of cellular self-organization and provides a mechanistic, data-driven understanding of emergence.
3.  **Novel Computational Methodologies:** We will develop and disseminate novel, open-source deep learning tools. The 3D CVAE for morphological analysis and the GNN for integrating network and imaging data will be powerful, generalizable methods applicable to a wide range of biological questions beyond the scope of this initial project.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **A Foundational Resource for the Research Community:** The primary outcome will be the 'Digital Cell' model, accessible via a user-friendly web portal. This will empower any researcher, regardless of their computational expertise, to perform *in silico* experiments. For example, a biologist studying a novel protein can use our tool to generate a testable hypothesis about its role in organizing a specific organelle, guiding future experiments and accelerating the pace of discovery. This directly fulfills the call's goal of developing innovative research strategies.
2.  **Applications in Disease Modeling and Drug Discovery:** Aberrant cell morphology is a hallmark of numerous diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, and neurodegeneration. Our model will provide a platform to understand the molecular basis of these morphological defects. It can be used to predict the physical consequences of disease-associated mutations or to screen for molecular targets that could restore a healthy morphology, opening new avenues for computational diagnostics and therapeutics.
3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdocs will work at the nexus of cell biology, computer vision, and biophysics, gaining invaluable cross-disciplinary skills. They will learn to manage large-scale data, develop sophisticated computational models, and work within a collaborative, open-science framework. We will further amplify this impact by hosting annual workshops to train the broader community on our tools and methods, fulfilling the call's mandate to train the future workforce.
4.  **Stimulating Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** The very structure of our working group, uniting cell biologists, computer scientists, and biophysicists from different institutions and career stages, embodies the collaborative spirit of the NCEMS program. The project's success is contingent on this deep integration of expertise, demonstrating a model for future community-scale synthesis projects. The need for NCEMS support is clear, as coordinating this effort, supporting dedicated personnel, and funding the required computational resources is beyond the capacity of any single lab or standard grant mechanism.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
We will pursue a multi-pronged dissemination strategy including high-impact publications, presentations at major international conferences, and the release of all code and models through public repositories (GitHub, Zenodo). Our long-term vision is to create an extensible framework. The initial model, built on hiPSCs, will serve as a scaffold. We envision the community contributing new data—from different cell types, tissues, or with new data modalities—to progressively expand the 'Digital Cell' into a multi-scale 'Digital Organism,' ensuring the project's lasting impact and sustainability.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_09,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,A Pan-Viral Synthesis of the Host-Pathogen Arms Race: Uncovering the Emergent Rules of Molecular Conflict,"The perpetual conflict between viruses and their hosts is a primary driver of molecular evolution, leading to the emergence of sophisticated host immune defenses and viral countermeasures. While individual examples are well-studied, the universal principles governing these molecular arms races remain poorly defined. This working group will perform the first comprehensive, pan-viral synthesis of host-virus evolution. We will integrate massive public datasets, including all available viral genomes from NCBI, hundreds of host genomes, and comprehensive databases of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions. Our team of virologists, evolutionary biologists, immunologists, and computational biologists will develop a powerful phylogenomic pipeline to systematically identify genes under positive selection—the molecular signatures of genetic conflict—across thousands of host-virus pairs. By mapping these rapidly evolving sites onto protein structures and interaction networks, we will uncover the emergent strategies of this conflict. We will identify conserved functional hotspots on host restriction factors targeted by diverse viral families and discover novel viral protein families dedicated to immune evasion. This project will produce a 'Molecular Conflict Atlas' that charts the evolutionary history and predicts future trajectories of host-virus interactions, providing a powerful framework for understanding viral emergence, pathogenesis, and the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.",,"Background And Significance

The co-evolutionary struggle between hosts and their viral pathogens is a central engine of molecular innovation and a key determinant of species' health and survival. This incessant 'arms race,' often described by the Red Queen hypothesis, forces the rapid evolution of both host defense mechanisms and viral countermeasures, leaving indelible signatures in their respective genomes. The study of this conflict has yielded profound insights into fundamental biological processes, from the basic mechanics of protein-protein interactions to the diversification of entire gene families. Seminal studies over the past two decades have beautifully illustrated this dynamic in specific host-virus systems. For instance, the discovery of primate TRIM5α as a restriction factor against retroviruses, and the subsequent identification of the viral capsid as its target, revealed a history of recurrent positive selection in both proteins at their interaction interface. Similarly, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, which lethally mutates viral genomes, has undergone dramatic expansion and diversification in primates, driven by antagonism from viral proteins like HIV's Vif, which itself is one of the most rapidly evolving genes in the viral genome. These canonical examples, alongside others like the protein kinase R (PKR) and myxovirus resistance (Mx) protein systems, have established a powerful paradigm: genes involved in host-virus conflicts can be identified by searching for the molecular signature of positive selection, where the rate of nonsynonymous substitution significantly exceeds the rate of synonymous substitution (dN/dS > 1). This approach has become a cornerstone of 'evolutionary immunology,' successfully identifying novel antiviral factors and pinpointing the precise molecular surfaces of conflict. However, our current understanding remains fragmented and anecdotal, largely derived from in-depth studies of a few well-chosen host lineages (primarily primates) and viral families (primarily retroviruses and lentiviruses). This narrow focus presents a major gap in our knowledge. We lack a systematic, global understanding of the principles governing these molecular arms races across the vast diversity of viruses and their hosts. Are the same host pathways repeatedly targeted by unrelated viruses? Do viruses convergently evolve similar molecular solutions to overcome conserved host defenses? Are there 'hotspots' of conflict in the host proteome that serve as a crucible for evolutionary innovation? Answering these questions has been impossible due to the immense scale of the required data and the need for deep, cross-disciplinary expertise. The current state of the field is a collection of fascinating, but disconnected, stories. This project aims to synthesize these stories into a coherent, universal narrative. The timeliness of this research cannot be overstated. We are living in an era of unprecedented data availability. Public repositories now contain millions of viral sequences from every conceivable environment and hundreds of high-quality host genomes spanning the tree of life. Concurrently, advances in computational power and phylogenomic methods have made it feasible to analyze these massive datasets at a scale previously unimaginable. The recent COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the critical need to understand the general principles of viral emergence and host adaptation. By moving beyond single-system studies to a comprehensive, pan-viral synthesis, we can uncover the emergent, predictive rules of molecular conflict. This project will transform the field from descriptive to predictive, providing a foundational framework for anticipating future pandemic threats and designing novel, broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group will address the central question: What are the universal principles and emergent properties of the molecular arms race between viruses and their hosts? To deconstruct this overarching goal, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes. 

**Question 1: What are the conserved molecular battlegrounds? A systematic identification of host and viral proteins under recurrent, intense evolutionary conflict.**
While we know of individual host restriction factors, we lack a global inventory of the genes most frequently engaged in viral conflict across diverse host taxa. Similarly, we have a limited catalog of the viral protein families dedicated to antagonizing these defenses.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A discrete subset of host protein functional classes (e.g., nucleic acid binding, ubiquitination machinery, membrane remodeling) are universally enriched for genes undergoing positive selection due to their central role in the host-virus interface.
*   **Prediction:** A genome-wide dN/dS scan across hundreds of host genomes will reveal that genes showing the strongest and most frequent signatures of positive selection are not randomly distributed but are significantly enriched in specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to innate immunity and core cellular processes co-opted by viruses.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** We can discover novel, uncharacterized viral immune evasion gene families by identifying viral ortholog groups that consistently exhibit high rates of positive selection across diverse viral lineages.
*   **Prediction:** Our pan-viral phylogenomic screen will identify numerous viral ortholog groups with high dN/dS ratios that currently lack functional annotation. The taxonomic distribution of these rapidly evolving viral genes will correlate with specific host clades, suggesting adaptation to a particular host's immune repertoire.

**Question 2: Are there convergent 'rules of engagement' at the structural level? Uncovering the shared strategies of molecular antagonism.**
The physical interfaces between host and viral proteins are the atomic arenas of conflict. We seek to determine if evolution repeatedly finds similar structural solutions to win these battles.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Across diverse host-virus systems, positive selection will convergently target structurally and functionally equivalent 'hotspots' on orthologous host proteins. These hotspots represent vulnerable surfaces critical for protein function that viruses must engage to disable them.
*   **Prediction:** When we map positively selected sites onto 3D protein structures (from PDB or AlphaFold), we will find that these sites are not randomly distributed on the protein surface. Instead, they will form statistically significant spatial clusters. Furthermore, the locations of these clusters on, for example, all mammalian orthologs of PKR, will be conserved, even when these mammals are targeted by different viruses.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The sites of rapid evolution on a viral antagonist and its host target will be in direct physical proximity, forming a co-evolving 'molecular scar' at the protein-protein interface.
*   **Prediction:** For known host-virus interacting pairs, structural modeling will show that the majority of positively selected residues on the host protein are within a small physical distance (e.g., <10 Å) of the positively selected residues on the viral protein.

**Question 3: Can the evolutionary history of conflict predict its future trajectory and outcomes?**
By integrating the patterns of selection across a broad evolutionary timescale, we aim to build a framework that has predictive power for host range, viral emergence, and pathogenesis.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The 'evolutionary dynamism' of a host species' immune arsenal—defined by the number of positively selected genes and the intensity of selection—can predict its susceptibility to viral spillover.
*   **Prediction:** Host species with a larger and more rapidly evolving repertoire of antiviral genes will harbor a narrower range of endemic viruses and will be identified as the source of fewer zoonotic events compared to species with less dynamic immune genomes.
*   **Deliverables:** The primary deliverable will be the 'Molecular Conflict Atlas,' a comprehensive, open-access database and web portal. This resource will integrate our findings, allowing users to query genes, species, and viruses to visualize evolutionary histories, selection pressures, and structural hotspots. We will also deliver a suite of validated, containerized computational workflows for large-scale evolutionary analysis, and a series of high-impact publications.

Methods And Approach

This project is a pure data synthesis effort, leveraging publicly available data and requiring no new experimental data generation. Our approach is organized into three synergistic aims that integrate phylogenomics, structural biology, and network science. The scale of this analysis—integrating millions of viral sequences with hundreds of host genomes—necessitates the collaborative, multidisciplinary team and NCEMS resources proposed.

**Data Acquisition and Curation**
Our foundation will be a meticulously curated collection of public data:
1.  **Host Genomes:** We will select ~500 representative, high-quality vertebrate and invertebrate genome assemblies from NCBI Genomes and Ensembl, prioritizing taxonomic breadth and assembly contiguity. We will use the official gene annotations for each species.
2.  **Viral Genomes:** We will download the entirety of the NCBI Viral Genomes Resource, encompassing all complete viral sequences from RefSeq and a curated subset from GenBank. This dataset comprises millions of sequences, which will be clustered into viral orthologous groups (VOGs) using established tools like vConTACT2.
3.  **Interaction Data:** We will integrate data from the Host-Pathogen Interaction Database (HPIDB), IntAct, and BioGRID to create a reference set of known host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This set will be used to validate our methods and to seed analyses of co-evolution.
4.  **Structural Data:** We will utilize all available empirical structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and supplement them with high-quality predicted models from the AlphaFold Database for proteins lacking experimental structures.

**Aim 1: A Global Map of Host and Viral Genes Under Positive Selection**
This aim will build the foundational dataset of genes involved in molecular conflict.
*   **Step 1: Host Orthogroup Identification:** We will use OrthoFinder to identify all one-to-one orthologs of protein-coding genes across our 500 host species. We will initially focus on a candidate list of ~2,000 genes with known or predicted immune function, later expanding to a genome-wide scale.
*   **Step 2: Phylogenomic Pipeline:** For each orthogroup, we will create multiple sequence alignments using MAFFT, perform quality trimming with Gblocks, and reconstruct gene trees using IQ-TREE under appropriate models of evolution. These steps will be automated in a Nextflow pipeline for scalability and reproducibility.
*   **Step 3: Positive Selection Analysis:** We will systematically apply the codeml program from the PAML package to each orthogroup alignment and gene tree. We will use site-models (M8 vs. M7) to identify specific codons under positive selection (dN/dS > 1) and use the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis to calculate posterior probabilities. To ensure robustness, we will corroborate significant findings with alternative methods like MEME and FUBAR from the HyPhy package. A stringent false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) will be applied to correct for multiple testing across thousands of genes.
*   **Step 4: Viral Selection Analysis:** A parallel pipeline will be applied to the VOGs identified from the viral genome dataset. This represents a significant computational challenge and a primary justification for NCEMS support.

**Aim 2: Structural and Co-evolutionary Analysis of Conflict Interfaces**
This aim will translate sequence-level data into mechanistic, structural insights.
*   **Step 1: Structural Mapping:** All statistically significant positively selected sites identified in Aim 1 will be mapped onto the corresponding protein structures (PDB or AlphaFold models).
*   **Step 2: Hotspot Identification:** We will employ spatial statistics to determine if these sites are randomly distributed or form significant 3D clusters. We will use a density-based clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN) on the 3D coordinates of the alpha-carbons of selected sites to identify 'evolutionary hotspots.'
*   **Step 3: Co-evolutionary Analysis:** For known and predicted interacting pairs, we will test for correlated evolutionary histories. This will involve comparing branch-specific dN/dS rates along the host and viral phylogenies and using methods like the Mirror-Tree server or custom phylogenetic correlation analyses to detect signatures of tightly coupled evolution.

**Aim 3: Synthesis, Prediction, and Creation of the Molecular Conflict Atlas**
This aim will integrate all data into a unified, predictive framework.
*   **Step 1: Network Construction:** We will build a bipartite network where nodes represent host genes and viral gene families. Edges will be drawn based on evidence of interaction (from databases or co-evolutionary analysis) and weighted by the intensity of positive selection.
*   **Step 2: Atlas Development:** We will develop a public web portal, the 'Molecular Conflict Atlas,' built on a robust database backend (e.g., PostgreSQL). This portal will feature interactive visualizations of phylogenies, protein structures with selection hotspots highlighted, and network graphs, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.

**Timeline and Milestones**
*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition and curation. Development and validation of the phylogenomic pipeline on a pilot dataset (e.g., primate genomes and their associated viruses). First in-person working group meeting.
*   **Year 2:** Full-scale execution of host and viral selection scans. Initial structural mapping and hotspot analysis. Development of the database schema for the Atlas. Mid-project meeting and trainee workshop.
*   **Year 3:** Co-evolutionary and network analyses. Completion and public launch of the Molecular Conflict Atlas. Manuscript preparation and dissemination of results. Final working group meeting.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will fundamentally shift our understanding of host-virus evolution from a collection of specific case studies to a comprehensive, data-driven science. By synthesizing the vast repository of public genomic data, we will uncover the emergent, generalizable principles of molecular conflict. The expected outcomes will have a profound and lasting impact on molecular and cellular biology, with direct applications in public health and pandemic preparedness.

**Intended Contributions to the Field**
1.  **A Foundational Resource: The Molecular Conflict Atlas:** The primary outcome will be a publicly accessible, dynamic web resource that integrates our findings. This 'Atlas' will be the first of its kind, providing a queryable database of host and viral genes under selection, their evolutionary histories, their structural 'hotspots' of conflict, and their interaction networks. It will serve as a hypothesis-generation engine for the entire virology and immunology community for years to come, enabling researchers to instantly look up the evolutionary history of their gene of interest.
2.  **A Global Inventory of Molecular Arms Dealers:** We will produce the first comprehensive catalog of host defense genes and viral immune evasion factors identified through their evolutionary signatures across the tree of life. This will undoubtedly reveal hundreds of novel players in this conflict, opening up entirely new avenues of experimental research.
3.  **Discovery of General Principles and Convergent Evolution:** Our synthesis will move beyond individual examples to reveal the 'rules of engagement.' We will determine which host cellular pathways are the most common battlegrounds and whether viruses from different families have convergently evolved similar structural solutions to antagonize them. This will provide a new framework for understanding protein function and adaptation under intense selective pressure.

**Broader Impacts and Applications**
1.  **Informing Antiviral Therapies:** By identifying the conserved functional hotspots on host proteins that are repeatedly targeted by viruses, we can pinpoint ideal targets for host-directed antiviral therapies. Conversely, identifying the rapidly evolving interfaces on viral proteins can help predict and mitigate viral escape from targeted drugs or vaccines.
2.  **Pandemic Preparedness and 'Evolutionary Surveillance':** Our framework will enable a new form of surveillance. By analyzing the genome of a newly discovered animal virus, we can assess its evolutionary trajectory. Does it show signatures of positive selection in genes known to interact with human orthologs? This information can help prioritize research and public health resources on animal viruses that show the most evolutionary potential for zoonotic spillover.
3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This project is an ideal training vehicle. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of this cross-disciplinary effort, gaining invaluable skills in phylogenomics, computational biology, big data analysis, and collaborative science. We will host a dedicated workshop to disseminate our methods and train a wider community, directly addressing the research call's goal of developing the future workforce.

**Dissemination and Open Science**
We are deeply committed to open science principles. All computational pipelines and custom code will be open-source and shared on GitHub with containerized (Docker/Singularity) workflows for full reproducibility. All curated data and results will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Dryad) and made available through the Molecular Conflict Atlas. We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications in leading journals (e.g., Nature, Science, Cell Host & Microbe), presentations at major international conferences (e.g., Gordon Research Conferences on Viruses & Cells, American Society for Virology), and seminars at diverse institutions. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to become a community-sustained resource, with a plan for continued updates as new genomic data becomes available, ensuring its lasting value to the scientific community.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project whose scope, computational demands, and multidisciplinary nature far exceed the capabilities of any single research lab or existing collaboration. The need to process millions of viral genomes and hundreds of host genomes in a unified phylogenomic framework requires a level of computational infrastructure and dedicated personnel that can only be supported by a dedicated initiative like NCEMS. This budget reflects the resources necessary to coordinate a geographically and scientifically diverse team to tackle this grand challenge.

**Budget Justification**
The primary costs are for personnel to drive the project, computational resources to perform the analysis, and travel to facilitate the essential in-person collaboration that sparks innovation.

ai_groups_of_scientists_gemini_10,ai,groups_of_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Cellular Phenotype Project: Predicting Emergent Cellular Behavior by Integrating the Functional Genomics Universe,"The ultimate goal of cellular biology is to predict phenotype from genotype. Achieving this requires a systems-level understanding of how molecular components interact to produce emergent cellular behaviors. This working group proposes an audacious 'grand challenge' project: to build a single, unified computational model of a human cell by synthesizing the entirety of public functional genomics data. We will create a multi-layered knowledge graph integrating data from dozens of major consortia, including ENCODE (regulatory elements), GTEx (tissue-specific expression), the Human Protein Atlas (protein localization), DepMap (CRISPR-based gene dependencies), STRING/BioGRID (protein interactions), Reactome (pathways), and ChEMBL (drug-target data). This graph will represent the most comprehensive in silico model of a cell ever constructed. Our team, comprising world leaders in systems biology, large-scale data integration, and artificial intelligence, will then deploy cutting-edge graph neural networks and other AI methodologies to learn the emergent rules of cellular function from this integrated network. The model will be trained to predict the phenotypic consequences of perturbations, such as the system-wide effects of knocking out a gene or introducing a drug. This project will serve as a community resource, providing a powerful, open-source platform to generate hypotheses, interpret complex datasets, and move biology toward a truly predictive science.",,"Background And Significance

The quest to understand the mapping from genotype to phenotype is the central challenge of modern biology. While the sequencing of the human genome provided the 'parts list' for a cell, understanding how these parts interact to create complex, emergent behaviors remains a formidable task. The post-genomic era has been characterized by an explosion of high-throughput functional genomics data, generated by large-scale international consortia. Projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) have mapped regulatory regions; the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has cataloged gene expression across human tissues; the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) has systematically determined protein localization; and the Dependency Map (DepMap) has identified genes essential for cancer cell survival. These resources, among many others, offer unprecedented, multi-faceted views into cellular function. However, a critical limitation persists: these monumental datasets are largely analyzed in isolation. Each provides a single, incomplete projection of an immensely complex system. Consequently, our understanding remains fragmented, and our ability to predict the system-level consequences of genetic or chemical perturbations is limited. This fragmentation represents a major barrier to translating genomic information into therapeutic advances and a deeper understanding of human health and disease. Early attempts in systems biology to create holistic models, such as those based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or Boolean networks, were powerful for small, well-characterized pathways but failed to scale to the complexity of an entire cell. The subsequent rise of network biology, focusing on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, provided a more scalable framework. Seminal work demonstrated that network topology could reveal functional modules and predict gene function. However, these models typically represented only one data type (e.g., physical interactions) and lacked the multi-modal context necessary to capture the full spectrum of cellular regulation. More recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating heterogeneous biological data. Projects like Hetionet have successfully integrated disparate databases to predict novel drug-disease relationships, demonstrating the power of connecting diverse information types. Yet, even these efforts have not fully incorporated the richness of modern functional genomics, such as genome-wide genetic dependency screens or comprehensive perturbational transcriptomics. The key gap this proposal addresses is the lack of a single, unified computational framework that can synthesize the full breadth of public functional genomics data to learn the fundamental rules of cellular behavior. This research is critically timely for two reasons. First, we have reached a critical mass of high-quality, publicly available data. The sheer volume and diversity of information from projects like DepMap, GTEx, and ENCODE now make a comprehensive synthesis not only possible but necessary to extract maximal value. Second, recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly the development of graph neural networks (GNNs), provide the ideal computational tool for this challenge. GNNs are specifically designed to learn from complex, relational data structured as graphs, enabling them to model the intricate web of interactions within a cell. By combining the vast repository of public data with cutting-edge AI, we are poised to move beyond descriptive, correlational studies towards a truly predictive and mechanistic model of the cell. This project directly aligns with the research call's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to synthesize public data, address a long-standing puzzle in cellular science, and develop innovative analytical strategies that are beyond the capacity of any single research lab.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This working group will address the overarching scientific challenge of building a predictive, in silico model of a human cell. Our research is structured around four fundamental questions, each associated with specific, testable hypotheses that will guide our data synthesis and model development efforts. Our primary goal is to create a model that not only recapitulates known biology but also generates novel, experimentally verifiable predictions about emergent cellular behavior. 

**Research Question 1 (Integration):** What is the optimal computational architecture for synthesizing the universe of public functional genomics data into a single, multi-layered, and biologically coherent knowledge graph? While many databases exist, their integration is non-trivial, requiring harmonization of identifiers, ontologies, and data structures. We will explore different graph schemas to determine how best to represent diverse molecular entities (genes, proteins, compounds) and their complex relationships (regulation, interaction, localization, etc.).
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A heterogeneous knowledge graph, incorporating at least ten distinct molecular data types (e.g., gene expression, protein interactions, genetic dependencies, chromatin accessibility) and representing entities as distinct node types, will yield significantly higher performance in downstream predictive tasks compared to models built on homogeneous graphs or smaller subsets of data. We predict that the richness of the integrated data will allow the model to learn more robust and generalizable biological rules.
*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** The inclusion of context-specific edges, such as tissue-specific expression (from GTEx) or cell-line-specific gene dependencies (from DepMap), will enable the model to make more accurate context-dependent predictions than a generic, context-agnostic model.

**Research Question 2 (Learning):** Can advanced graph neural network (GNN) architectures learn the complex, non-linear patterns of molecular interactions from this integrated graph to effectively model the rules of cellular function?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** A Graph Transformer or Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) model, trained on our Cellular Phenotype Knowledge Graph (CP-KG), will outperform current state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) and models trained on individual data types in predicting held-out experimental data. Specifically, we predict a >15% improvement in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve for predicting gene essentiality.
*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** The node embeddings (latent representations) learned by the GNN will capture deep, biologically meaningful information. We hypothesize that genes with similar embeddings, even if not directly connected in the input graph, will share functional roles. We will test this by evaluating whether the cosine similarity of gene embeddings correlates with semantic similarity in Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

**Research Question 3 (Prediction):** How accurately can the trained model predict the phenotypic outcomes of novel genetic and chemical perturbations that were not seen during training?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** Our model can predict the essentiality of genes in cell lines held out from the training set with high accuracy. We will validate this by training the model on 80% of the cell lines in DepMap and testing its performance on the remaining 20%, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different genetic backgrounds.
*   **Hypothesis 3.2:** The model can predict cellular responses to drugs. By representing drugs as nodes and training the model on known drug sensitivity data (e.g., from the GDSC database), we hypothesize it can predict the efficacy of novel compounds or the response of untested cell lines to existing drugs. We will validate these predictions against new, publicly released drug screen data.

**Research Question 4 (Emergence):** Can we interrogate the trained model to uncover novel, higher-order principles of cellular organization and emergent biological phenomena?
*   **Hypothesis 4.1:** Using model interpretability techniques (e.g., GNNExplainer), we can identify the specific subgraphs and molecular pathways that are most influential for a given prediction (e.g., why a cell is sensitive to a particular drug). We hypothesize these identified pathways will be enriched for known mechanisms of action and will also reveal novel, off-target effects.
*   **Hypothesis 4.2:** In silico perturbation experiments—simulating the effect of a gene knockout by computationally removing its corresponding node from the graph—will accurately predict the resulting changes in the expression of other genes. We will validate these predictions against experimental data from perturbational datasets like the Connectivity Map (CMap L1000). This will demonstrate the model's capacity to predict the cascading, system-wide effects that define emergent phenotypes.

Methods And Approach

Our methodology is organized into three synergistic aims, forming a comprehensive plan to construct, train, and interrogate a predictive model of the cell. This project is exclusively computational and relies entirely on the synthesis of publicly available data, perfectly aligning with the research call's focus. The collaborative, multi-lab structure is essential for integrating the diverse expertise required for each aim.

**Aim 1: Construct the Cellular Phenotype Knowledge Graph (CP-KG).**
This foundational aim focuses on the aggregation, harmonization, and integration of disparate public datasets into a unified, machine-readable graph structure. This task requires significant bioinformatic expertise and is a community-scale effort.
*   **Data Sources:** We will integrate data from over a dozen major consortia and databases. Key sources include: (1) **Genomic/Epigenomic:** ENCODE (transcription factor binding sites, chromatin accessibility), JASPAR (TF motifs); (2) **Transcriptomic:** GTEx (baseline tissue expression), TCGA (cancer expression), Connectivity Map L1000 (gene expression post-perturbation); (3) **Proteomic:** Human Protein Atlas (subcellular localization, abundance), BioPlex/HuRI (physical protein-protein interactions); (4) **Functional/Genetic:** DepMap/Project Achilles (genome-wide CRISPR gene dependency scores), ClinVar (disease-associated variants); (5) **Pathways/Interactions:** Reactome, KEGG (curated pathways), STRING, BioGRID (functional and physical interaction networks); (6) **Chemical Biology:** ChEMBL, DrugBank (drug-target relationships), GDSC/CTRP (drug sensitivity screens).
*   **Integration and Harmonization:** We will establish a formal graph schema with defined node and edge types. Node types will include Gene, Protein, Chemical Compound, Disease, Pathway, and Cell Line. Edge types will represent relationships like `regulates_expression`, `physically_interacts_with`, `is_localized_in`, `is_essential_in`, `targets`, and `is_associated_with`. All biological entities will be mapped to standardized identifiers (e.g., Ensembl, UniProt, ChEBI) to resolve ambiguity. The integrated graph will be stored in a Neo4j database for efficient querying and exported to formats compatible with machine learning libraries like PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL).

**Aim 2: Develop and Train Predictive AI Models on the CP-KG.**
This aim leverages our team's expertise in artificial intelligence to build models that learn the rules of cellular function from the CP-KG.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will primarily use Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT), which are specifically designed to handle the diverse node and edge types in our CP-KG. The HGT model uses a meta-path-based attention mechanism to learn the importance of different relationship types when aggregating information across the graph.
*   **Training Strategy:** We will employ a two-stage training process. First, we will use self-supervised pre-training, where the model learns fundamental biological relationships by performing tasks like link prediction (predicting masked interactions) on the entire graph. This allows the model to learn rich, general-purpose embeddings for all nodes. Second, we will fine-tune the pre-trained model on specific supervised tasks using held-out datasets. Key tasks include: (1) **Gene Essentiality Prediction:** Predicting the CRISPR dependency score for each gene-cell line pair from DepMap. (2) **Drug Sensitivity Prediction:** Predicting the IC50 value for a given drug-cell line pair from GDSC. (3) **Perturbation Outcome Prediction:** Predicting the L1000 differential expression signature resulting from a specific genetic or chemical perturbation.
*   **Validation and Controls:** All models will be evaluated using rigorous k-fold cross-validation. To ensure we are testing for true generalization, folds will be stratified to hold out entire cell lines, drugs, or gene families, preventing trivial memorization. As a baseline control, we will compare our GNN's performance against simpler models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) trained on non-integrated data features. We will also perform temporal validation by training on older data releases and testing on newly discovered interactions or functional annotations.

**Aim 3: Interrogate the Model to Uncover Emergent Biological Principles.**
With a validated model, this aim focuses on using it as a virtual laboratory to generate novel hypotheses.
*   **Model Interpretability:** We will use post-hoc explanation methods like GNNExplainer and Integrated Gradients to dissect model predictions. For example, when the model predicts a gene is essential, we will identify the minimal subgraph of interactions (e.g., a specific pathway) that was most influential in that decision.
*   **In Silico Perturbations:** We will systematically simulate perturbations by altering the graph structure or node features. For a gene knockout, we will remove the corresponding gene node and its edges and use the GNN to predict the resulting changes in the embeddings and properties of all other nodes in the graph. This allows us to simulate the cascading, system-wide effects of perturbations and identify critical nodes that mediate cellular robustness.

**Timeline:**
*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Data acquisition, harmonization, and construction of CP-KG v1.0. Development and benchmarking of data processing pipelines. Initial implementation of the HGT model architecture. Milestone: Public release of CP-KG v1.0 schema and data.
*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of models for all predictive tasks. Rigorous cross-validation and benchmarking. First manuscript detailing the CP-KG and predictive framework. Milestone: Public release of trained models and open-source code.
*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36):** In-depth model interrogation, large-scale in silico perturbation studies, and biological interpretation of findings. Development of a user-friendly web portal for community access. Final manuscripts and dissemination at international conferences. Milestone: Launch of the Cellular Phenotype Project web portal.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The Cellular Phenotype Project is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor designed to create a paradigm shift in how cellular biology is studied. Its success will yield transformative outcomes and have a profound impact on both fundamental science and translational medicine. This project's scale and ambition directly address the research call's goal of tackling grand challenges through community-scale data synthesis.

**Expected Outcomes and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Foundational Community Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the Cellular Phenotype Knowledge Graph (CP-KG) and the associated predictive models. This will be the most comprehensive, integrated in silico model of a human cell ever created. We will adhere strictly to Open Science principles, making the graph, all model code, and a user-friendly web portal publicly available. This resource will democratize systems-level analysis, enabling researchers worldwide to query the integrated knowledge base, generate hypotheses, and perform virtual experiments that would be impossible in a wet lab setting.
2.  **A New Paradigm for Predictive Biology:** This project will move the field beyond descriptive genomics and correlational network analysis towards a truly predictive science. By demonstrating that an AI model can learn the rules of cellular function from integrated data, we will establish a new framework for understanding the genotype-phenotype map. This will serve as a blueprint for future efforts to model more complex biological systems, such as tissues, organs, or even entire organisms.
3.  **Novel Biological Discoveries:** The model is not just a repository of known information but a discovery engine. We expect to identify thousands of novel, high-confidence predictions, including: new functions for uncharacterized genes, previously unknown pathways mediating drug response, unexpected cross-talk between signaling pathways, and key molecular players that govern cellular robustness and disease states. These in silico discoveries will provide a rich source of testable hypotheses for the broader experimental community.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Drug Discovery and Development:** The pharmaceutical industry invests billions in identifying new drug targets and predicting patient responses. Our platform will provide a powerful tool for in silico target validation by predicting the system-wide consequences of inhibiting a specific protein. It can also be used to predict drug efficacy and toxicity across diverse genetic backgrounds, stratify patient populations for clinical trials, and identify novel drug repurposing opportunities.
*   **Advancing Personalized Medicine:** The ultimate vision is to create patient-specific models. By inputting a patient's genomic and transcriptomic data, future iterations of this model could predict their individual susceptibility to disease or their likely response to a panel of treatments, paving the way for truly personalized therapeutic strategies.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment that sits at the intersection of biology, computer science, and data science. Graduate students and postdocs involved will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary skills, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-driven workforce. We will further amplify this impact by hosting annual workshops and releasing tutorials to train the wider community in using our tools and methods.

**Dissemination and Sustainability:**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-faceted. We will publish our findings in high-impact journals such as *Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell*, with methods-focused papers in journals like *Nature Methods* or *Nature Machine Intelligence*. All publications will be open-access. We will present our work at leading international conferences (e.g., ISMB, RECOMB, AACR). The long-term sustainability of the project will be ensured by building an active user community around our open-source tools and by seeking follow-up funding from federal agencies (e.g., NIH) to expand the model to include new data types (metabolomics, single-cell omics) and to build disease-specific versions (e.g., a 'Cancer Cell Phenotype Project'). This project will establish a living, evolving resource that will grow in value as more public data becomes available.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:** This project is the epitome of a community-scale synthesis project. No single lab possesses the combined expertise in functional genomics, network biology, and cutting-edge AI, nor the resources to undertake the massive data integration and computational modeling effort required. The NCEMS framework is essential to bring together this diverse team, provide the necessary computational infrastructure, and support the collaborative environment needed to tackle this 'grand challenge' in cellular biology.",,

This Working Group will integrate multi-modal data including Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and Micro-C from the 4D Nucleome portal to map genome topology; single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq from cell atlases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas) to link chromatin state to gene expression at cellular resolution; and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics for histone modifications and transcription factor binding. Our transdisciplinary team, comprising polymer physicists, computational biologists, developmental biologists, and machine learning experts, will develop novel graph-based neural networks and dynamical systems models. These models will aim to uncover the 'grammatical rules' governing how interactions between regulatory elements, topological associating domains (TADs), and nuclear compartments orchestrate complex gene expression programs during differentiation. The project's success will yield a powerful in silico tool to predict how perturbations to genome architecture—such as those caused by structural variants in cancer or developmental disorders—lead to aberrant cell identities. This work will provide unprecedented insight into the emergent logic of cellular programming and establish a new paradigm for studying genome function.",,"Background And Significance

The establishment and maintenance of cellular identity is a cornerstone of multicellular life and a classic example of an emergent biological phenomenon. How hundreds of distinct, stable cell types arise from a single zygotic genome remains one of the most fundamental questions in biology. While the central dogma describes the flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein, it is the complex regulatory landscape controlling this flow that specifies cell type. This landscape is not merely linear; it is profoundly shaped by the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome within the nucleus. The past decade has revolutionized our understanding of this architecture, revealing a hierarchical organization from nucleosomes to chromatin loops, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), and large-scale compartments (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009; Dixon et al., 2012). This structure is not random; it is intimately linked to function. TADs, for instance, act as insulated neighborhoods that constrain enhancer-promoter interactions, ensuring genes are regulated appropriately. The disruption of these boundaries by structural variants is now a known mechanism in developmental disorders and cancer (Lupiáñez et al., 2015). Concurrently, large-scale international consortia such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Roadmap Epigenomics Project, the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Program, and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) have generated an unprecedented wealth of publicly available data. We now have access to multi-modal datasets spanning 3D genome conformation (Hi-C, Micro-C), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), histone modifications and transcription factor binding (ChIP-seq), and gene expression (RNA-seq) across a vast array of human cell types, often at single-cell resolution. This data explosion presents a monumental opportunity for synthesis. Despite these advances, critical gaps in our knowledge persist, preventing a truly predictive understanding of genome function. First, our view of genome architecture is largely static. We have snapshots of different cell types but lack a comprehensive, dynamic model of how architecture reconfigures during cell fate transitions. Second, existing computational models are often siloed, focusing on predicting one aspect of genome organization (e.g., TAD boundaries from sequence) but failing to integrate multi-modal data to predict a holistic, functional outcome like a cell-type-specific gene expression program. Third, and most critically, our understanding remains descriptive rather than predictive. We can characterize the architectural differences between a neuron and a lymphocyte, but we cannot yet formulate a set of generalizable 'rules' or a computational model that can predict, *ab initio*, the functional consequences of a specific architectural perturbation. There is no 'compiler' to translate the language of genome structure into the language of cellular function. This project is both important and timely because it directly addresses these gaps. It is important because a predictive model of genome function would transform our ability to interpret genetic variation, understand disease mechanisms, and engineer cell fates for therapeutic purposes. It is timely because the necessary ingredients are finally in place: the requisite large-scale public data is available, and advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning on graphs, provide the powerful analytical tools needed to tackle this complexity. This proposal outlines a community-scale synthesis project to build this 'Chromatin Compiler,' a framework that will learn the grammatical rules of genome architecture and provide a quantitative, predictive model of how cellular identity emerges from the dynamic folding of the genome.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

Our overarching goal is to develop and validate a predictive computational framework, the 'Chromatin Compiler,' that formalizes the relationship between 3D genome architecture and the emergent property of cellular identity. This ambitious objective is broken down into three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): What are the fundamental architectural principles and regulatory 'grammar' that define a stable cellular identity?**
We posit that the complex, multi-modal data describing a cell's chromatin state can be distilled into a core set of predictive features and interaction rules. 
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A stable cellular identity is encoded by a unique, multi-scale 'signature' of chromatin interactions. This signature is not defined by any single feature but by the synergistic combination of specific long-range enhancer-promoter contacts, the precise positioning and insulation strength of TAD boundaries, and the global pattern of genomic compartmentalization. 
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** A finite set of 'grammatical rules' governs these interactions. We hypothesize that cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic marks act as a regulatory 'syntax,' determining which genomic loci can interact and modulating the probability and stability of these interactions. For example, the presence of H3K27ac and pioneer TFs at distal elements may be a rule that 'permits' looping to a promoter marked by H3K4me3.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will test these hypotheses by building a graph neural network (GNN) that integrates multi-modal data (Hi-C, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) to classify cell types. Success will be defined by high classification accuracy (>95%) on held-out test data. We will then use model interpretability techniques (e.g., GNNExplainer) to extract the features and interactions (the 'grammar') most salient for each cell-type classification, thereby validating our hypotheses.

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): How do dynamic changes in genome architecture orchestrate cell fate transitions during differentiation?**
We propose that differentiation is not a random walk but a directed, programmatic process of architectural remodeling.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Cell differentiation follows a stereotyped trajectory through a high-dimensional 'chromatin state space.' This trajectory is characterized by the ordered and sequential formation, dissolution, and rewiring of specific chromatin loops and TADs, which precedes and directs changes in gene expression.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** Master developmental transcription factors (e.g., PAX6 in neurogenesis) act as primary drivers of these architectural changes. They function by binding to key nodes in the chromatin network, initiating local changes in accessibility and recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes, which then propagate through the network to establish a new, stable architectural state.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will use publicly available time-series multi-omic data from well-characterized *in vitro* differentiation systems (e.g., embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes). We will develop a spatio-temporal GNN or a neural ODE model to learn the transition rules between successive time points. The model will be validated by its ability to accurately predict future chromatin and expression states from earlier ones. We will perform *in silico* 'knockout' experiments by removing the signal of a master TF from the input data and predicting the resulting deviation from the normal differentiation trajectory, comparing these predictions to published experimental results.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can the Chromatin Compiler predict the functional consequences of architectural perturbations, such as pathogenic structural variants (SVs), on cellular identity?**
We aim to move from descriptive correlation to causal prediction, using our model as a tool for *in silico* genetics.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** Pathogenic non-coding SVs exert their effects primarily by altering the 'grammatical rules' of chromatin folding. Deletions of TAD boundaries, for example, lead to 'enhancer hijacking' by allowing enhancers from one domain to ectopically activate oncogenes in an adjacent domain. Inversions and translocations can create novel, disease-driving enhancer-promoter contacts.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** Our trained Chromatin Compiler can accurately predict the aberrant gene expression patterns resulting from a given SV. By inputting the altered genomic sequence and structure, the model will predict the new 3D contact map and, consequently, which genes will be misregulated.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will curate a validation set of well-characterized pathogenic SVs from literature and databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar). We will implement these SVs *in silico* within our model's framework and predict their impact on gene expression in the relevant cell type. Predictions will be quantitatively compared against ground-truth experimental data (e.g., RNA-seq, 4C-seq) from patient-derived cells or engineered cell lines harboring these SVs. The model's predictive power will be assessed by the correlation between predicted and observed changes in gene expression.

Methods And Approach

This project is founded on the synthesis of public data and the development of novel computational methods, executed by a transdisciplinary Working Group. Our approach is organized into four synergistic aims that directly address our research questions.

**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** The project's success hinges on the deep integration of diverse expertise. The team comprises four PIs and their trainees: **PI 1 (Computational Biology)** will lead data acquisition, harmonization, and the development of reproducible analysis pipelines. **PI 2 (Machine Learning)** will spearhead the design, implementation, and training of the core deep learning models. **PI 3 (Polymer Physics)** will provide theoretical guidance on chromatin biophysics, ensuring our models are physically plausible and aiding in the interpretation of architectural changes. **PI 4 (Developmental Biology)** will provide crucial biological context, guiding the selection of cellular systems and validating the biological relevance of model predictions. The group will convene for biannual, intensive in-person workshops, supplemented by weekly virtual meetings, to foster continuous collaboration. Trainees will be co-mentored and will spend time in partner labs to gain cross-disciplinary skills.

**Aim 1: Unified Multi-modal Chromatin Data Compendium.** The foundation of our project is a comprehensive, harmonized database of publicly available human genomics data. We will systematically mine repositories including 4D Nucleome, ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GEO, and the Human Cell Atlas. Data types will include: 1) **3D Architecture:** Hi-C, Micro-C, ChIA-PET; 2) **1D Epigenomics:** ChIP-seq for key histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3) and architectural proteins (CTCF, RAD21), ATAC-seq, and DNase-seq; and 3) **Transcriptomics:** Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. We will focus on curating data from at least 100 distinct cell types and several well-documented differentiation time courses (e.g., ESCs to neurons, HSCs to hematopoietic lineages). All data will be processed through a single, containerized (Docker/Singularity) and version-controlled (Nextflow) pipeline to ensure maximal reproducibility and eliminate batch effects from variable processing. The final output will be a unified data resource where all modalities are mapped to a common genomic coordinate system, ready for machine learning integration.

**Aim 2: Modeling Static Cellular Identity with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).** To address RQ1, we will represent the genome as a graph. Genomic regions (e.g., 10kb bins) will serve as nodes. Node features will be vectors of 1D epigenomic signals from Aim 1. Edges between nodes will be weighted by their 3D contact frequency from Hi-C data. We will develop a Graph Attention Network (GAT), a GNN architecture adept at learning the importance of different neighbors in a graph. The model will be trained on our compendium of cell types with the objective of predicting the cell type label from the input chromatin graph. The trained model will serve as our initial 'Chromatin Compiler.' We will employ model interpretation tools (e.g., saliency maps, attention weight analysis) to dissect the trained model and extract the predictive genomic features and interactions that constitute the 'grammatical rules' of each cell identity.

**Aim 3: Modeling Dynamic Cell Fate Transitions.** To address RQ2, we will extend our static model to capture dynamics. Using time-series data from differentiation, we will build a spatio-temporal GNN. This model will incorporate a recurrent component (like an LSTM or GRU) or be framed as a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) to learn the continuous-time evolution of the chromatin state. The model will learn a function `f` that maps the chromatin graph at time `t` to the graph at time `t+1`. Validation will involve predicting later time points from earlier ones and assessing the model's ability to reconstruct the known differentiation trajectory. This dynamic model will allow us to identify critical 'bifurcation points' in the chromatin state space where cell fate decisions are made and to pinpoint the key TF and regulatory events that drive these transitions through *in silico* perturbation experiments.

**Aim 4: Predictive Modeling of Architectural Perturbations.** To address RQ3, we will build a predictive module on top of our trained models. This module will take a structural variant (SV) as input (e.g., coordinates of a deletion, inversion, or translocation). It will algorithmically modify the genomic graph representation to reflect the SV. The perturbed graph will then be fed into the trained 'Chromatin Compiler' from Aim 2. We will add a regression head to the GNN, trained to predict gene expression levels from the surrounding chromatin graph state. The model's output will be a prediction of the new 3D contact landscape and the resulting changes in gene expression for all genes near the SV. We will validate these predictions against a curated set of known pathogenic SVs, comparing our *in silico* results with published experimental data.

**Timeline:** **Year 1:** Completion of Aim 1 data compendium; development and initial training of the static GNN model (Aim 2). **Year 2:** Refinement and interpretation of the static model; development and training of the dynamic model (Aim 3); first major publication on the static compiler. **Year 3:** Validation of the dynamic model; development and validation of the SV prediction module (Aim 4); release of the open-source 'Chromatin Compiler' software package and web portal; final publications.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The 'Chromatin Compiler' project is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor poised to fundamentally shift the paradigm of genome biology from a descriptive to a predictive science. Its success will yield profound intellectual contributions, significant broader impacts on human health, and a powerful new platform for the scientific community, directly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS research call.

**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field:** The primary outcome of this work will be a validated, predictive computational framework that quantitatively links 3D genome architecture to cellular identity. This represents a significant leap beyond current correlative studies. We will deliver: 1) A comprehensive, harmonized multi-modal atlas of the human epigenome and 3D genome. 2) A novel class of machine learning models (spatio-temporal GNNs) tailored for integrative genomics. 3) A catalogue of the architectural 'grammatical rules' that define and maintain specific cell types. 4) The first dynamic models that map the architectural trajectories of cell differentiation. By formalizing how a complex biological property—cellular identity—emerges from the collective interactions of molecular components, this project provides a concrete solution to a central question in emergence phenomena, a core focus of this call. It will establish a new field of 'predictive 4D genomics.'

**Broader Impacts and Biomedical Applications:** The long-term impact of the Chromatin Compiler on biomedical research will be substantial. The ability to predict the functional consequences of genomic variants is a central goal of personalized medicine. Our framework will provide a powerful tool for: 1) **Interpreting Disease Genomics:** Over 90% of disease-associated variants from GWAS lie in non-coding regions. Our tool will help prioritize and mechanistically explain how these variants, particularly structural variants, contribute to disease by altering genome architecture. 2) **Understanding Developmental Disorders:** Many congenital diseases are caused by mutations that disrupt long-range gene regulation. The Compiler will provide a means to diagnose and understand these 'chromatinopathies.' 3) **Cancer Biology:** We can use the model to understand how somatic SVs in cancer genomes lead to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor inactivation through mechanisms like enhancer hijacking, providing insights for novel therapeutic strategies. 4) **Synthetic Biology:** A deep understanding of the genome's operating principles is a prerequisite for rational cell engineering. The 'rules' we uncover could guide the design of synthetic chromosomes and customized cell types for regenerative medicine.

**Alignment with NCEMS Goals:** This project is perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission. It is a community-scale synthesis project that is impossible for a single lab to undertake due to the immense data scale and the need for tightly integrated, diverse expertise (ML, physics, computational and developmental biology). It leverages exclusively public data to answer a fundamental question. We are committed to **Open Science**; all code will be open-source (GitHub), data will be shared via public repositories (Zenodo), and models will be accessible through a user-friendly web portal. Our dissemination plan includes high-impact, open-access publications and presentations at major international conferences. Furthermore, the project is designed to **Train the Next Generation** of data-savvy scientists. Trainees will be at the heart of the collaboration, gaining unique interdisciplinary skills that are in high demand. We will host an annual open hackathon to disseminate our tools and train the broader community, tapping into diverse new talent. The collaborative partnership we have assembled spans multiple institutions, career stages, and scientific disciplines, ensuring a rich and innovative research environment.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research requires a level of coordinated effort, computational power, and diverse expertise that extends far beyond the capacity of a single research lab or a traditional multi-PI grant. The NCEMS Working Group mechanism is uniquely suited to provide the necessary support and collaborative infrastructure for this community-scale synthesis project.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:** The primary challenge of this project is the integration of two distinct elements: massive, heterogeneous datasets and deep, diverse intellectual expertise. A single lab may possess expertise in one area but not all (e.g., machine learning but not developmental biology). NCEMS support is critical for assembling our geographically dispersed team of experts in computational biology, machine learning, polymer physics, and developmental biology, and providing the dedicated resources for them to function as a single, cohesive unit. Furthermore, the computational costs associated with training deep learning models on petabyte-scale genomic data are substantial and often exceed the budget of standard research grants. NCEMS funding will provide the necessary cloud computing resources and support for data management, which are central to the project's success. Finally, the NCEMS framework for regular in-person meetings and workshops is essential for fostering the intense, cross-disciplinary brainstorming required to develop truly innovative models and interpret their biological meaning.

**Budget Breakdown (3-Year Total):**
*   **Personnel ($480,000):** This constitutes the largest portion of the budget, reflecting our focus on training and dedicated effort. This includes salary and benefits for two full-time Postdoctoral Fellows who will be the primary technical leads, and stipend support for two Graduate Students. It also includes one month of summer salary for each of the four PIs to ensure dedicated time for management, supervision, and intellectual leadership.
*   **Computational Resources ($150,000):** This is a critical component for a project of this scale. Funds are requested for cloud computing credits (e.g., AWS/GCP) for GPU/TPU access required for training large-scale graph neural networks. This also includes costs for long-term cloud storage of the harmonized data compendium.
*   **Travel ($90,000):** To facilitate deep collaboration, we request funds for biannual, three-day in-person meetings of the entire Working Group (4 PIs, 4 trainees). Funds are also allocated for each trainee and PI to attend one major international conference per year to present their findings and network with the broader community.
*   **Training and Dissemination ($60,000):** This includes costs to organize and host an annual two-day workshop/hackathon open to the wider scientific community, providing training on our tools and methods. It also covers costs for developing and maintaining a public web portal for the Chromatin Compiler and open-access publication fees for an anticipated 4-5 manuscripts.
*   **Indirect Costs (IDC):** Calculated based on the respective institutional rates, applied to the direct costs.

**Total Direct Costs:** $780,000

**Institutional Resources:** The PIs' home institutions will provide significant in-kind support, including faculty and administrative salaries, office and lab space, and access to institutional high-performance computing clusters for model development and data preprocessing, thereby leveraging existing infrastructure and demonstrating strong institutional commitment to the project.",,
ai_single_scientist_gemini_02,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,Deconstructing the Condensatome: A Predictive Atlas of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation in Cellular Function and Disease,"The discovery of biomolecular condensates, membraneless organelles formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), has revolutionized our understanding of cellular organization. These dynamic compartments emerge from multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, concentrating components to regulate key processes like transcription and stress response. However, the sequence-level rules governing which molecules enter which condensate, and how condensate properties yield specific functions, remain elusive. This Working Group will build a predictive atlas of the 'condensatome' by synthesizing disparate public data. We will integrate protein sequence and domain information (UniProt, Pfam), experimentally determined and predicted structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB), protein-protein interaction networks (STRING, BioGRID), and LLPS-specific databases (PhaSepDB, DrLLPS). Our team of biophysicists, protein biochemists, cell biologists, and AI specialists will employ advanced machine learning models, including large language models trained on protein sequences and graph neural networks on interaction data, to predict LLPS propensity and composition. We will correlate these predictions with cell-type-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data to understand how the cellular context modulates condensate formation. A key goal is to identify the 'emergent grammar' of LLPS and predict how mutations, suchas those found in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's, disrupt condensate dynamics and lead to pathological aggregation. This project will produce a publicly accessible, predictive platform that will transform our ability to understand and therapeutically target the emergent biology of cellular compartmentalization.",,"Background And Significance

The paradigm of cellular organization has been fundamentally reshaped by the discovery of biomolecular condensates, membraneless compartments formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). These dynamic assemblies, such as the nucleolus, stress granules, and processing bodies, emerge from multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, creating distinct biochemical environments that regulate a vast array of cellular processes. This emergent phenomenon of self-organization challenges the classical view of a cell governed solely by membrane-bound organelles. The formation of condensates is primarily driven by proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low-complexity domains (LCDs), which engage in a network of transient, specific interactions. The 'sticker-and-spacer' model provides a powerful conceptual framework, where 'stickers' (e.g., aromatic residues, charged motifs) mediate interactions and 'spacers' dictate the dynamics and material properties of the resulting condensate. The functional consequences are profound; by concentrating specific molecules and excluding others, condensates can enhance reaction rates, sequester components, and act as hubs for signal transduction and gene regulation. The significance of LLPS extends to pathophysiology. A growing body of evidence links aberrant phase transitions, particularly the conversion of dynamic liquid condensates into solid, pathological aggregates, to the etiology of numerous diseases. In neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), mutations in RNA-binding proteins such as FUS and TDP-43 promote their aggregation within stress granules. Similarly, the pathological aggregation of Tau protein in Alzheimer's disease is now understood through the lens of LLPS. Despite this rapid progress, the field faces critical knowledge gaps that hinder our ability to predict and control condensate behavior. Current understanding of the 'condensatome'—the complete set of condensates and their components—is fragmented and largely descriptive. We lack a comprehensive, predictive model that can answer fundamental questions: What are the precise sequence and structural features that determine a protein's partitioning into a specific condensate? How does the cellular context, including protein concentrations and post-translational modifications, modulate the composition and function of the condensatome? And how do disease-associated mutations disrupt this delicate equilibrium? Existing computational tools have made initial strides but are limited. Predictors like PScore, catGRANULE, and FuzDrop primarily rely on amino acid sequence features to predict a generic propensity for LLPS. While useful, they often fail to capture the specificity of interactions that dictate which proteins co-assemble. Furthermore, they do not typically integrate structural information or the broader context of protein-protein interaction networks. Databases such as PhaSepDB and DrLLPS are invaluable repositories of experimentally validated phase-separating proteins, but they represent a sparse sampling of the proteome and lack the integrative framework needed for system-wide prediction. This project is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the explosion of publicly available biological data—from comprehensive protein sequences (UniProt) and interaction maps (BioGRID, STRING) to the revolutionary availability of accurate predicted structures for entire proteomes (AlphaFold DB)—provides the raw material for an unprecedented data synthesis effort. Second, recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly the development of protein large language models (pLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), offer powerful new methodologies to learn complex patterns from multi-modal biological data. This Working Group will address these gaps by synthesizing these disparate data streams within a unified machine learning framework. By building a predictive atlas of the condensatome, we will move beyond describing individual components to understanding the emergent, system-level logic of cellular organization, providing a transformative resource for basic science and therapeutic discovery.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This Working Group is organized around a central overarching question: Can we decipher the multi-modal 'grammar'—encoded in protein sequence, structure, and interaction networks—that governs the assembly, composition, and function of the cellular condensatome? To address this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research aims, each with testable hypotheses and clear validation strategies.

**Aim 1: Develop a unified, multi-modal machine learning framework to predict protein LLPS propensity and condensate-specific partitioning.**
This aim addresses the fundamental limitation of current predictors by integrating diverse data types to achieve a more holistic and accurate model of LLPS. 
*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can a model that integrates protein sequence, 3D structure, and network context significantly outperform single-modality approaches in predicting a protein's intrinsic ability to undergo LLPS?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that an integrative machine learning model, combining embeddings from a protein language model (pLM) for sequence, a geometric deep learning model for structure (from AlphaFold DB), and a graph neural network (GNN) for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network topology, will yield superior predictive performance for LLPS propensity. The synergy of these modalities will capture complementary information: pLMs excel at context-rich sequence patterns, structural models reveal surface properties and multivalency, and GNNs encode the system-level context of potential binding partners.
*   **Validation 1.1:** The model will be trained on a curated set of known phase-separating proteins (positives) from PhaSepDB and LLPSDB and a rigorously selected set of negatives. Performance will be evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves under strict cross-validation and on held-out test sets. We will benchmark our multi-modal approach against a suite of state-of-the-art, single-modality predictors.
*   **Research Question 1.2:** Beyond general propensity, can we predict the specific condensate(s) a protein is likely to partition into?
*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that the learned multi-modal representations contain signatures specific to different condensate types (e.g., nucleolus, stress granule, P-body). By training a multi-label classifier on these representations using proteins with known subcellular locations from high-quality, condensate-specific proteomic datasets, we can accurately predict a protein's 'condensate fingerprint'.
*   **Validation 1.2:** We will use proteins with experimentally verified, exclusive localization to specific condensates as a gold-standard test set. We will assess classification accuracy and use model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP) to identify the key sequence, structural, and network features that distinguish different condensate families.

**Aim 2: Elucidate how cellular context modulates the composition and dynamics of the condensatome.**
LLPS is not a fixed property but an emergent behavior sensitive to the cellular environment. This aim seeks to model that context-dependency.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** How do variations in protein and RNA expression levels across different cell types and physiological states alter the predicted landscape of biomolecular condensates?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that the probability of a condensate forming and its final composition are critically dependent on the stoichiometry of its components. By integrating cell-type-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data (from GTEx, Human Protein Atlas) into our GNN framework, we can create 'context-aware' predictions. We predict that condensates will be more stable in cell types where their core scaffold proteins are highly expressed, and their client composition will reflect the abundance of available binding partners.
*   **Validation 2.1:** We will generate predicted condensatomes for well-characterized cell lines (e.g., U2OS, HeLa, HEK293). These predictions will be systematically compared against published, experimentally determined condensate proteomes for these same cell lines, assessing the overlap and correlation of component enrichment.

**Aim 3: Predict the functional impact of genetic variants on condensate integrity and link disruptions to disease pathology.**
This aim leverages our predictive framework to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype in condensate-related diseases.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can our model accurately quantify how disease-associated mutations alter a protein's LLPS behavior and its interactions within the condensatome?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that pathogenic mutations found in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., in FUS, TDP-43, Tau from ClinVar) will receive high 'disruption scores' from our model. These scores will reflect predicted changes in LLPS propensity, interaction partner affinity, or a shift towards aggregation-prone states. In contrast, benign polymorphisms from gnomAD will have minimal predicted impact.
*   **Validation 3.1:** We will perform a large-scale in silico saturation mutagenesis analysis on key condensate proteins. Our predicted disruption scores will be benchmarked against published experimental data (e.g., changes in saturation concentration, droplet fusion dynamics, or fibrillization rates) for a subset of these mutations. We will also assess the ability of our score to discriminate between known pathogenic and benign variants from clinical databases, a critical test of its translational potential.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary Working Group composed of three synergistic teams, ensuring that diverse expertise is leveraged to tackle this complex data synthesis challenge. The teams are: Team A (Data Curation & Integration), comprising computational biologists; Team B (Machine Learning & Model Development), led by AI specialists; and Team C (Biological Interpretation & Validation), consisting of cell biologists and biophysicists. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be embedded within each team and will participate in regular cross-team meetings and annual in-person workshops to foster collaboration and provide comprehensive training, directly aligning with the NCEMS mission.

**Phase 1: Unified Data Curation and Integration (Months 1-6)**
The foundation of this project is the creation of a comprehensive, harmonized knowledge graph. Team A will be responsible for this critical first step.
*   **Data Sources:** We will aggregate data from a wide array of public repositories. 
    *   **Sequence & Function:** UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (canonical human sequences, PTMs, functional annotations), Pfam and InterPro (protein domain definitions).
    *   **Structure:** The Protein Data Bank (PDB) for experimentally determined structures and the AlphaFold DB for high-quality, comprehensive predicted structures of the human proteome.
    *   **Interactions:** BioGRID and the Human Reference Interactome (HuRI) for curated physical protein-protein interactions (PPIs). STRING will be used for functional associations, filtered for high-confidence evidence channels.
    *   **LLPS Ground Truth:** PhaSepDB, LLPSDB, and DrLLPS will be integrated to form a gold-standard set of known phase-separating proteins, their interacting partners, and experimental conditions.
    *   **Cellular Context:** Gene- and protein-level expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the Human Protein Atlas will provide tissue- and cell-type-specific context.
    *   **Genetic Variation:** ClinVar and gnomAD will be our primary sources for disease-associated and population variants, respectively.
*   **Integration Pipeline:** Data will be programmatically downloaded, parsed, and cleaned. We will implement a rigorous entity resolution protocol to map identifiers across databases. The integrated data will be loaded into a Neo4j graph database, where proteins are nodes and their diverse relationships (e.g., physical interaction, domain co-occurrence, functional association) are represented as typed edges with associated properties (e.g., confidence scores, experimental evidence).

**Phase 2: Multi-Modal Model Development and Training (Months 7-18)**
Team B, in close consultation with Team C, will develop and validate our core predictive models.
*   **Feature Engineering:** We will generate rich, multi-modal feature representations for every human protein.
    *   **Sequence Embeddings:** We will use a state-of-the-art, pre-trained protein large language model (pLM), such as ESM-2, to generate fixed-length vector embeddings from protein sequences. These embeddings capture latent evolutionary and biophysical information.
    *   **Structural Embeddings:** Using the AlphaFold structures, we will employ a geometric deep learning model (e.g., a graph convolutional network operating on the protein structure graph) to learn features describing surface charge distribution, hydrophobicity, and the spatial arrangement of potential 'sticker' residues.
    *   **Network Embeddings:** A graph neural network (GNN), such as GraphSAGE, will be applied to our integrated PPI network to generate embeddings that encode a protein's network topology and local neighborhood.
*   **Aim 1 Model (Propensity & Partitioning):** The sequence, structural, and network embeddings will be concatenated and passed through a deep neural network classifier. This model will first be trained as a binary classifier for general LLPS propensity. Subsequently, using condensate-specific proteomic data as labels, it will be adapted for multi-label classification to predict partitioning into specific condensates.
*   **Aim 2 Model (Context-Awareness):** To model cellular context, we will create tissue-specific PPI graphs by weighting the edges based on the co-expression levels of the interacting proteins in that tissue. The GNN will be re-trained on these weighted graphs to produce context-specific network embeddings, which will then be used to make context-dependent predictions of condensate stability and composition.
*   **Aim 3 Model (Mutation Impact):** We will build an in silico mutagenesis pipeline. For a given variant, the mutated protein sequence will be generated. Its 3D structure will be re-predicted using efficient tools like ColabFold. The new sequence and structure will be passed through our feature extractors and trained models. The difference between the output scores of the mutant and wild-type proteins will yield a 'disruption score,' quantifying the mutation's predicted impact on LLPS.

**Phase 3: Atlas Construction, Validation, and Dissemination (Months 19-24)**
Team C will lead the biological interpretation of model outputs and the development of the public-facing resource.
*   **The Condensatome Atlas:** We will build a user-friendly web portal with an intuitive interface. Users will be able to search for their protein of interest and view its predicted LLPS score, its predicted condensate partners, the features driving the prediction, and the predicted impact of known clinical variants. The portal will feature network visualizations of predicted condensate compositions across different cell types.
*   **Open Science Commitment:** In adherence with NCEMS principles, all software will be open-sourced on GitHub with permissive licenses. All curated datasets, trained model weights, and genome-wide predictions will be deposited in Zenodo. A comprehensive API will be developed to allow programmatic access to the atlas data, facilitating its integration into other analysis pipelines.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Month 6:** Completion of the integrated data warehouse and feature extraction pipeline.
*   **Month 12:** Version 1.0 of the multi-modal LLPS propensity and partitioning predictor is trained, benchmarked, and internally validated.
*   **Month 18:** Context-aware and mutation-impact prediction models are finalized. Beta version of the web portal is deployed for internal testing.
*   **Month 24:** Public launch of the Condensatome Atlas web portal and API. Submission of primary manuscripts describing the resource and key biological findings.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will yield transformative outcomes and exert a significant, long-term impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences. Our work will not only generate a powerful new resource for the scientific community but will also fundamentally advance our understanding of the principles of cellular organization.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Predictive, Mechanistic Atlas of the Condensatome:** The primary outcome will be the 'Condensatome Atlas,' a first-of-its-kind, publicly accessible platform. Unlike existing static databases, our atlas will be predictive and dynamic. It will provide the community with system-wide predictions of LLPS propensity, condensate composition, and context-dependent modulation for the entire human proteome. This resource will empower researchers to move from observation to hypothesis, enabling them to query how their protein of interest behaves within the complex landscape of cellular compartmentalization.
2.  **Deciphering the 'Grammar' of LLPS:** By applying interpretable AI techniques to our multi-modal models, we will deconstruct the complex interplay of factors that govern condensate assembly. This will allow us to move beyond simple correlations (e.g., IDR content) to a more nuanced understanding of the emergent 'grammar' of LLPS. We expect to identify novel sequence motifs, define the specific structural contexts that confer multivalency, and uncover the network topologies that stabilize distinct condensates. This represents a major step towards a comprehensive, first-principles understanding of biological self-assembly.
3.  **A New Paradigm for Data Synthesis in Cell Biology:** This project will serve as a blueprint for applying integrative, multi-modal machine learning to other complex problems in biology. Our methodology for harmonizing sequence, structure, network, and expression data to predict an emergent cellular phenotype will be broadly applicable to areas such as signal transduction, protein complex formation, and metabolic network analysis.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Accelerating Disease Research and Therapeutic Development:** The atlas will have immediate translational relevance. By providing a tool to systematically predict the impact of mutations on condensate integrity, we will help researchers prioritize variants of unknown significance and elucidate disease mechanisms. For neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's, our platform can identify critical nodes in the network of pathological phase transitions, revealing novel targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at restoring condensate homeostasis or preventing aggregation.
2.  **Enabling Rational Design in Synthetic Biology:** A deep, predictive understanding of the rules of LLPS will empower the field of synthetic biology. Engineers will be able to use our atlas and models to design synthetic proteins and RNA molecules that form artificial condensates with bespoke properties. These synthetic organelles could be used to create novel bioreactors, sequester toxic metabolites, or control complex metabolic pathways within engineered cells.
3.  **Training a New Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** In line with the NCEMS mission, our Working Group is structured to provide exceptional training opportunities. Graduate students and postdocs will gain hands-on experience at the cutting edge of computational biology, machine learning, and data science, all while being deeply embedded in a collaborative, transdisciplinary environment. Through our open-source tools and public workshops, we will disseminate these skills to the broader community, helping to build the future data-savvy workforce.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
Our commitment to open science is unwavering. All outcomes will be made immediately and broadly available. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals (e.g., Cell, Nature Methods). The Condensatome Atlas web portal and its underlying API will be freely accessible without restriction. All source code will be maintained in a public GitHub repository, and all curated data and model weights will be deposited in Zenodo with detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility. We will actively promote the resource through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ASCB, ISMB) and by hosting virtual tutorials and workshops.

**Long-Term Vision:**
The NCEMS support is critical to catalyze this ambitious synthesis effort, which is far beyond the scope of a single research lab. The collaborative network and computational infrastructure established by this project will create a durable hub for condensate research. We envision the atlas as a living resource, sustained long-term by the lead institution and updated with new data from the community. This foundational work will seed numerous follow-up projects, including experimental validation of novel predictions and the pursuit of large-scale center grants to further explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the condensatome.

Budget And Resources

The proposed budget is designed to support a highly collaborative, computationally intensive, three-PI Working Group for a 24-month period. The resources requested are essential for the project's success and reflect the community-scale nature of the research, which surpasses the capabilities of any single lab or standard research grant.

**1. Personnel (Approximately 65% of total budget):**
The primary investment is in dedicated personnel who will drive the project's research and development activities.
*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (3.0 FTEs):** We request support for three full-time postdoctoral fellows, one based in each collaborating PI's lab. Each postdoc will lead one of the core teams: Data Integration, ML Model Development, and Biological Interpretation/Validation. Their focused effort is critical for executing the ambitious data synthesis and modeling tasks.
*   **Graduate Students (3 x 0.5 FTEs):** To fulfill the NCEMS training mission, we request partial support (stipend and tuition) for three graduate students. These trainees will be mentored by the PIs and postdocs, contributing directly to the project's aims while receiving unparalleled cross-disciplinary training in data science and molecular biology.
*   **Principal Investigator Effort (3 x 0.5 summer months/year):** We request modest summer salary support for the three PIs to ensure they have dedicated time for project management, intensive mentoring, cross-team coordination, and manuscript preparation.

**2. Computational Resources (Approximately 15%):**
Training state-of-the-art machine learning models on proteome-scale datasets is a significant computational expense.
*   **Cloud Computing Credits / HPC Access:** We request a substantial allocation for GPU-enabled cloud computing (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) or for purchasing dedicated GPU nodes for an institutional high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. This is essential for training protein language models and large-scale graph neural networks.
*   **Data Storage and Servers:** Funds are requested for a dedicated server to host the integrated Neo4j database and the public-facing web portal, including costs for long-term, robust data storage and backup (estimated 5-10 TB).

**Justification for NCEMS Support:**
This project is uniquely suited for the NCEMS program. The synthesis of vast, disparate public datasets to address a fundamental question of emergent biological organization requires a collaborative, multi-lab effort with diverse expertise that cannot be assembled or funded through traditional mechanisms like an NIH R01. The need for dedicated computational resources (HPC/cloud) and specialized personnel (postdocs with hybrid expertise) goes beyond the scope of a single lab. NCEMS support is the catalyst required to bring together this specific team, provide them with the necessary resources, and enable a transformative project that will produce a lasting, open resource for the entire biosciences community.",,
ai_single_scientist_gemini_03,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,The Metabolic Symphony of the Tumor Microenvironment: Emergence of Drug Resistance and Immunosuppression,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem where cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and other stromal cells engage in intricate metabolic cross-talk. Emergent properties of this system, such as profound immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance, are major barriers to effective cancer treatment. This Working Group aims to deconstruct this 'metabolic symphony' by building a spatially-resolved, multi-cellular model of TME metabolism. We will synthesize publicly available single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data (from TCGA, GEO, and specialized atlases), proteomics data, and public metabolomics datasets. Our collaborative team, uniting cancer biologists, immunologists, computational systems biologists, and spatial data scientists, will develop novel computational methods to integrate these data layers. We will use this integrated data to parameterize community-scale, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) that simulate nutrient competition and metabolite exchange between every cell type within a spatially-defined TME. The goal is to identify critical metabolic dependencies and feedback loops that drive emergent system-level behaviors. For example, how does lactate produced by glycolytic cancer cells reprogram macrophages to an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype? How do cancer-associated fibroblasts fuel tumor growth? By simulating metabolic perturbations, we will predict novel therapeutic strategies that disrupt these symbiotic interactions, aiming to break drug resistance and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. This synthesis project will provide a systems-level blueprint of TME metabolism, offering a powerful new lens through which to view and treat cancer.",,"Background And Significance

The treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by immunotherapies, yet a significant fraction of patients fails to respond, largely due to the complex and immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is not merely a passive scaffold for malignant cells but a dynamic, multicellular ecosystem where cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells engage in a complex network of interactions. A growing body of evidence indicates that metabolism is a central organizing principle of this ecosystem. The concept of metabolic reprogramming in cancer, first described by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, has evolved from a cancer-cell-centric view to one that encompasses the entire TME. It is now clear that the metabolic activities of all cellular constituents are deeply intertwined, creating a unique metabolic landscape that promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Key examples of this metabolic cross-talk are well-documented. Cancer cells, through aerobic glycolysis, consume vast amounts of glucose and secrete lactate, leading to a nutrient-poor, acidic milieu that cripples the function of effector T cells, which also rely on glucose for their anti-tumor activity. This lactate is not merely a waste product; it acts as a signaling molecule that polarizes macrophages towards an immunosuppressive, pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype. Similarly, the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), often expressed by cancer or stromal cells, depletes local tryptophan, an amino acid essential for T cell proliferation, thereby inducing immune tolerance. Beyond competition, metabolic symbiosis is also a critical feature. The 'reverse Warburg effect' posits that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) undergo glycolysis and export lactate and other nutrients, which are then taken up and utilized by adjacent cancer cells for oxidative phosphorylation, effectively 'feeding' the tumor. These individual examples, while insightful, represent only single threads in a much larger, more intricate tapestry. The fundamental limitation of current research is its reductionist approach, which typically focuses on a single pathway or the interaction between two cell types. This fails to capture the emergent properties of the TME—system-level behaviors like robust immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance that arise from the collective, nonlinear interactions of all components. The advent of high-throughput omics technologies, particularly single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, has provided unprecedented, high-resolution snapshots of the TME's cellular composition and spatial organization. We can now identify dozens of cell subtypes and map their locations relative to one another. However, these data are largely descriptive. A critical gap exists in our ability to translate these static maps into a dynamic, mechanistic understanding of the metabolic fluxes and interactions that govern TME function. We lack integrated, predictive models that can simulate how the spatial arrangement of cells dictates local metabolic niches and how perturbations to one component ripple through the entire system. This proposal is both important and timely because it directly addresses this gap. The explosion of publicly available, multi-modal TME datasets from consortia like TCGA, CPTAC, and the Human Tumor Atlas Network provides a rich, untapped resource for data synthesis. Concurrently, computational systems biology approaches, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, have matured to a point where they can be adapted to tackle multi-cellular systems. By convening a multidisciplinary Working Group of cancer immunologists, computational biologists, and spatial data scientists, we are uniquely positioned to synthesize these disparate data streams into the first spatially-resolved, multi-cellular metabolic model of the TME. This project will move the field beyond correlative observations to a predictive, systems-level understanding of TME metabolism, uncovering novel vulnerabilities and paving the way for next-generation metabolic therapies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to develop and apply a novel computational framework that synthesizes public multi-omics data to build a predictive, spatially-resolved model of tumor microenvironment (TME) metabolism. This model will serve as an in silico laboratory to dissect the emergent properties of the TME, specifically immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance, and to identify novel metabolic targets to reverse these states. To achieve this goal, we will address three central research questions, each associated with a specific, testable hypothesis. 

**Research Question 1: How does the spatial organization of distinct cell types within the TME orchestrate local metabolic niches and give rise to emergent, system-level immunosuppressive functions?**
The arrangement of cells is not random; it creates micro-domains with unique metabolic properties. A glycolytic tumor cell cluster will create a different metabolic environment than a region rich in oxidative CAFs. We hypothesize that the functional state of immune cells is critically dependent on their spatial 'metabolic zip code'.
*   **Hypothesis 1:** The emergence of functionally distinct, immunosuppressive TME domains is a spatially-determined phenomenon driven by localized gradients of key immunomodulatory metabolites (e.g., lactate, kynurenine, adenosine, protons). We predict that our spatially-resolved model will reveal specific, recurring spatial motifs, such as the co-localization of lactate-secreting cancer cells with M2-polarized, arginase-expressing macrophages. We will test this by simulating metabolite concentrations across the spatial map and correlating these predictions with the observed functional states of immune cells inferred from transcriptomic data. We further predict that in silico disruption of these spatial motifs (e.g., by moving T-cells away from lactate 'hotspots') will revert their simulated metabolic and functional state towards an anti-tumor phenotype.

**Research Question 2: What are the critical metabolic dependencies and symbiotic cross-feeding interactions between cancer cells and the diverse stromal and immune cell populations that are essential for sustained tumor growth and immune evasion?**
Tumors are complex ecosystems that thrive on metabolic cooperation. Identifying the keystone interactions that support the entire system is crucial for developing effective therapies. We aim to move beyond known interactions to create a comprehensive, unbiased map of these metabolic exchanges.
*   **Hypothesis 2:** Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immunosuppressive myeloid cells function as metabolic 'hubs,' reprogramming their own metabolism to supply limiting nutrients and anabolic precursors to cancer cells, thereby sustaining proliferation under nutrient stress. We hypothesize that our multi-cellular model will identify specific, high-flux metabolic exchange pathways (e.g., transfer of specific amino acids, lipids, or TCA cycle intermediates) from CAFs or M2 macrophages to cancer cells. We will test this by performing in silico 'knockout' experiments. We predict that blocking the efflux of a key metabolite from CAFs in our model will have a more profound inhibitory effect on cancer cell biomass production than blocking the synthesis of that same metabolite within the cancer cell itself, thus revealing a critical, non-cell-autonomous dependency.

**Research Question 3: Can we computationally identify and validate novel metabolic checkpoints that, when targeted, synergize with existing immunotherapies to overcome resistance by remodeling the TME?**
The ultimate goal is to translate our systems-level understanding into therapeutic strategies. The metabolic state of the TME is a key determinant of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
*   **Hypothesis 3:** The metabolic signature of the TME is a robust predictor of response to immunotherapy, and targeted metabolic interventions can sensitize non-responsive tumors to ICIs. We will parameterize our models using public datasets from patients treated with ICIs, separating them into responder and non-responder cohorts. We predict the non-responder models will exhibit distinct metabolic features, such as higher lactate production and greater nutrient competition between tumor and T-cells. We will test this by simulating the effects of various metabolic inhibitors in our 'non-responder' models. We predict that in silico inhibition of specific enzymes (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase A in cancer cells, arginase 1 in myeloid cells, or fatty acid oxidation pathways in regulatory T-cells) will not only directly impact tumor cells but will also remodel the simulated TME to be more permissive to T-cell function (e.g., increased glucose/glutamine availability for T-cells), thereby creating a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with simulated anti-PD-1 therapy. The deliverable will be a ranked list of metabolic targets predicted to have the highest synergistic potential.

Methods And Approach

This project is founded on the synthesis of publicly available data and the collaborative expertise of our multidisciplinary Working Group, which unites computational systems biologists, cancer immunologists, and spatial data scientists. Our approach is organized into three sequential but interconnected aims, designed to build a robust, predictive model of TME metabolism from the ground up. The entire workflow will be developed as an open-source, reproducible pipeline.

**Data Sources and Curation:**
We will exclusively use publicly available data, obviating the need for new data generation. Our primary data sources include:
1.  **Single-Cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq):** Datasets from repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We will focus on major cancer types with rich data availability, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer, ensuring we have data from both primary tumors and metastases.
2.  **Spatial Transcriptomics (ST):** We will leverage publicly available datasets generated using platforms like 10x Genomics Visium, which provide gene expression data overlaid on a tissue histology image. These datasets are critical for providing the spatial scaffold for our models.
3.  **Proteomics:** Data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) will be used to constrain our metabolic models, as enzyme abundance is often more directly related to metabolic flux than mRNA levels.
4.  **Metabolomics:** Publicly available mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and bulk metabolomics data from resources like the Metabolomics Workbench will be used not for model construction, but for validation of our model's predictions of spatial metabolite distributions.
5.  **Knowledge Bases:** Our models will be built upon the foundation of human metabolic reconstructions like Recon3D and HMR2.0, with pathway information from KEGG and Reactome.

**Aim 1: Data Harmonization and Multi-Modal Integration (Months 1-9)**
The first major challenge is to process and integrate these diverse data types. We will develop a standardized computational pipeline to:
*   Process raw scRNA-seq data using tools like Seurat or Scanpy for quality control, normalization, and cell type annotation based on canonical marker genes. This will yield cell-type-specific expression profiles for all major TME constituents (e.g., malignant cells, T-cell subtypes, macrophages, CAFs, endothelial cells).
*   Process ST data using tools like Squidpy and Giotto. This involves aligning ST spots to the histology image and performing cell-type deconvolution, an analytical process that estimates the proportion of each cell type within each spatial spot, by integrating the scRNA-seq data.
*   Integrate proteomics data by mapping proteins to their corresponding genes and using these abundance levels to further refine expression estimates.
The output of Aim 1 will be a unified data object for each tumor sample, containing cell type definitions, their spatial locations, and their associated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles.

**Aim 2: Construction of Spatially-Resolved, Multi-Cellular Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs) (Months 7-24)**
This aim forms the core of our proposal. We will build our TME model in three steps:
1.  **Cell-Type-Specific GEMs:** For each cell type identified in Aim 1, we will generate a context-specific metabolic model. Using its unique expression profile, we will 'prune' a generic human GEM (e.g., Recon3D) to retain only the reactions and pathways active in that cell type, using established algorithms like iMAT or GIMME. This results in a unique metabolic network for each cell type.
2.  **Spatial Scaffolding:** We will use the processed ST data to create a 2D grid that represents the tissue slice. Each location (spot) on this grid will be populated with the specific GEMs corresponding to the cell types found there, weighted by their predicted abundance from the deconvolution step.
3.  **Community Simulation:** We will implement a community metabolic modeling framework, such as COMETS (Computation of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space), adapted for a mammalian system. This framework simulates the metabolic activity of all cells simultaneously. All cells in the grid share a common extracellular environment, allowing them to compete for nutrients (e.g., glucose, oxygen, amino acids) and exchange metabolites (e.g., lactate, acetate). We will use Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to predict metabolic fluxes for each cell, defining biologically relevant objective functions (e.g., maximizing biomass for cancer cells, maximizing cytokine production for T-cells). This integrated model will allow us to simulate the emergent metabolic state of the entire TME.

**Aim 3: In Silico Simulation, Hypothesis Testing, and Target Identification (Months 19-36)**
With the model built, we will use it as a virtual laboratory:
*   **Model Validation:** We will first validate the model by comparing its predictions (e.g., spatial distribution of lactate) against withheld metabolomics data and established experimental findings from the literature.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** We will systematically address our research questions. To test Hypothesis 1, we will analyze the predicted spatial metabolite gradients and their correlation with immune cell states. For Hypothesis 2, we will perform in silico gene knockouts for hundreds of metabolic enzymes and transporters in each cell type to map the network of metabolic dependencies. For Hypothesis 3, we will build models of immunotherapy responders and non-responders and simulate the systemic effects of combining metabolic inhibitors with anti-PD-1 therapy, quantifying synergy.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of the data integration pipeline (M9); generation of first-generation, non-spatial multi-cellular models (M12).
*   **Year 2:** First fully spatially-resolved TME model for melanoma completed and validated (M18); comprehensive dependency mapping and initial therapeutic target list generated (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Models for lung and breast cancer completed (M30); synergistic combination therapies predicted and prioritized (M32); public release of open-source software, models, and web portal (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project, through its large-scale synthesis of public data, is poised to deliver transformative outcomes and have a significant impact on both basic cancer biology and translational oncology. Our contributions will be methodological, conceptual, and therapeutic.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **A Novel, Open-Source Computational Platform:** A primary deliverable will be our complete, documented, and containerized (e.g., Docker) computational pipeline for integrating spatial and single-cell multi-omics data to build spatially-resolved metabolic models. This platform will be a powerful resource for the broader research community, adaptable to other cancer types and even other complex tissue environments like those in fibrosis or neurodegeneration.
2.  **A Spatially-Resolved Metabolic Atlas of the TME:** We will generate the first comprehensive, dynamic maps of metabolic activity across different tumor types. These atlases will visualize nutrient consumption, metabolite exchange, and pathway activity with cellular and spatial resolution. This will be made accessible through an interactive web portal, allowing researchers to explore metabolic heterogeneity in the TME without requiring computational expertise.
3.  **New Mechanistic Insights into TME Biology:** Our systems-level approach will uncover emergent properties of TME metabolism that are invisible to reductionist methods. We expect to identify novel metabolic symbioses, unappreciated nutrient dependencies, and the precise mechanisms by which spatial organization dictates immune function. For example, we may discover that a specific metabolic exchange between endothelial cells and regulatory T-cells is a key, previously unknown driver of immunosuppression.
4.  **A Prioritized List of Novel Therapeutic Targets:** The ultimate translational outcome will be a high-confidence, computationally validated list of metabolic enzymes and transporters predicted to be critical nodes in the TME network. Crucially, these will not just be targets in cancer cells, but also in stromal and immune cells. We will also provide predictions for which of these targets are most likely to synergize with existing immunotherapies, providing a strong rationale for future preclinical and clinical investigation.

**Broader Impact and Applications:**
*   **Advancing Cancer Research:** This project will shift the paradigm of cancer metabolism research from a cell-centric to an ecosystem-level perspective. Our findings and tools will enable countless new research directions for cancer biologists and immunologists, providing a framework to interpret their own experimental data in a richer, systemic context.
*   **Accelerating Therapeutic Development:** The in silico platform can serve as a screening tool to rapidly test and prioritize novel metabolic drug targets and combination strategies, reducing the time and cost associated with preclinical research. This can help de-risk the development of new cancer therapies for both academic labs and pharmaceutical partners.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** This project is intrinsically multidisciplinary and collaborative, providing an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will gain unique, highly sought-after skills at the intersection of big data analysis, computational modeling, and cancer biology. In line with the research call's mission, we will actively train a new generation of data-savvy scientists through hands-on research, workshops, and the development of open-source educational materials.
*   **Commitment to Open and Reproducible Science:** By adhering strictly to open science principles—making all code, data, and models publicly available—we will ensure our work is transparent, reproducible, and a lasting resource for the entire scientific community. This fosters a culture of collaboration and accelerates the pace of discovery.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**
Our dissemination strategy includes high-impact publications, presentations at major international conferences (AACR, SITC, ISMB), and annual workshops to train users on our platform. Our long-term vision is to establish this Working Group as a durable hub for TME systems biology. The developed framework will be continuously expanded to incorporate new data types (e.g., epigenomics, proteomics) and new cancer types. The collaborative network forged by this project will catalyze future research, ensuring that the impact of this NCEMS-supported initiative extends far beyond the initial funding period, creating a self-sustaining community focused on solving complex biological problems through data synthesis.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the scope and capabilities of a single research laboratory or a typical multi-PI R01 grant. The project's success hinges on the deep integration of diverse expertise—cancer immunology, computational systems biology, and spatial data science—and the dedicated effort required to synthesize vast, heterogeneous public datasets. This aligns perfectly with the mission of the NCEMS to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to address fundamental questions through data synthesis. Traditional funding mechanisms prioritize new data generation, whereas our project exclusively leverages existing data, requiring significant person-hours for data curation, methods development, and large-scale computational analysis. NCEMS support is therefore essential to provide the protected time, collaborative infrastructure, and specialized personnel needed for a project of this magnitude.

While well-studied in individual proteins, a proteome-wide understanding of allosteric communication pathways is lacking. This Working Group will create a comprehensive, predictive map of allostery across the human proteome. We will synthesize a massive corpus of public data, including static protein structures (PDB), structural ensembles (NMR, cryo-EM), and predicted structures (AlphaFold DB); molecular dynamics simulation trajectories from repositories like MDTraj and MDsrv; and large-scale sequence data with evolutionary couplings (Pfam, EVcouplings). We will also integrate data on disease- and population-level mutations (ClinVar, gnomAD) to identify variants that likely function by disrupting allosteric regulation. Our team, composed of structural biologists, computational chemists, bioinformaticians, and machine learning experts, will develop a novel framework based on graph theory and geometric deep learning. This framework will model proteins as dynamic networks, identifying conserved pathways of communication ('allosteric wires') that are invisible to static structural analysis. The ultimate goal is to create a publicly accessible 'Allosterome Atlas' that allows researchers to query any protein and visualize its potential allosteric sites and communication pathways. This resource will revolutionize drug discovery by revealing novel druggable sites on challenging targets and provide a new framework for interpreting the functional impact of genetic variation.",,"Background And Significance

Allostery is a fundamental emergent property of biological macromolecules, enabling the regulation of protein function through ligand binding or covalent modification at sites distal to the primary functional site. This 'action at a distance' is the linchpin of cellular signaling, metabolic feedback, and genetic regulation, allowing proteins to act as sophisticated information processors. The classical models of Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) first conceptualized allostery in terms of discrete conformational state transitions. However, our modern understanding, informed by decades of biophysical research, has evolved to view proteins as dynamic conformational ensembles (Frauenfelder et al., 1991). In this paradigm, allostery arises from a perturbation of the protein's free energy landscape, where a binding event at one site shifts the equilibrium distribution of conformational states, thereby altering the activity at a distant site (Cooper & Dryden, 1984). This dynamic view is critical, as it implies that allosteric communication pathways are not necessarily encoded in a single static structure but are emergent properties of the protein's collective motions.

Despite its central importance, our knowledge of allostery remains fragmented and largely anecdotal, confined to a few well-studied protein systems like hemoglobin, lac repressor, and protein kinases. The methods developed to study these systems have provided invaluable insights but are not scalable to the proteome level. Experimental techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and double-mutant cycles are low-throughput and resource-intensive. Computationally, several approaches have been developed to probe allosteric mechanisms. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, map the complete conformational landscape, but are computationally expensive. Network-based models, such as Protein Structure Networks (PSNs), represent proteins as graphs of interacting residues and use network theory metrics to identify communication pathways (Bahar et al., 2010). Sequence-based methods, like Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) and Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), leverage the vast amount of sequence data to identify co-evolving residues, which are often functionally and allosterically linked (Lockless & Ranganathan, 1999; Morcos et al., 2011). More recently, machine learning models have shown promise in predicting allosteric sites from sequence and structural features.

A critical gap in the field is the absence of a unified, systematic framework to map allosteric communication networks across an entire proteome. Current approaches suffer from several key limitations. First, they typically rely on a single data modality—either static structure, sequence co-evolution, or limited dynamics—failing to integrate these complementary sources of information. Allostery is a multi-faceted phenomenon, and a holistic understanding requires synthesizing structural, dynamic, and evolutionary data. Second, most studies are based on single, static crystal structures, which represent only one snapshot of a dynamic ensemble and may completely obscure the pathways of communication. Third, the connection between genetic variation and allosteric disruption is profoundly under-explored. A vast number of disease-associated mutations, particularly Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), are located far from active sites, and it is highly probable that many of them exert their pathogenic effects by perturbing allosteric regulation. 

This research is exceptionally timely. We are at a unique confluence of data availability and methodological advancement. The AlphaFold database provides high-quality structural models for the entire human proteome, solving the structural coverage problem. Public repositories of MD simulations are growing, and genomic databases like ClinVar and gnomAD contain millions of annotated human variants. Concurrently, advances in geometric deep learning provide a powerful new toolkit for learning complex patterns from 3D structural and graph-based data. This project directly addresses the research call's mandate by proposing to synthesize these massive, publicly available datasets using a transdisciplinary team to answer a fundamental question about an emergent cellular phenomenon. By creating a proteome-wide map of allostery, we will provide a new layer of functional annotation, revolutionize our ability to target proteins therapeutically, and establish a new paradigm for interpreting the impact of genetic variation.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to transition the study of allostery from a case-by-case endeavor to a systematic, proteome-wide science. We aim to develop a novel computational framework to synthesize multi-modal public data and generate a predictive, comprehensive map of allosteric communication networks across the human proteome—the 'Allosterome Atlas.' This endeavor is guided by a set of specific, interconnected research questions and testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: Can a unified computational framework that integrates static structure, conformational dynamics, and evolutionary information systematically and accurately identify allosteric communication pathways on a proteome-wide scale?**
Currently, methods for predicting allostery are fragmented, each leveraging a different data type. We propose that a holistic approach that learns from these disparate but complementary data streams will yield a more accurate and robust model of allosteric communication than any single method alone.
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** A multi-modal geometric deep learning model, trained on integrated features from experimental structures (PDB), predicted structures (AlphaFold), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and evolutionary couplings (EVcouplings), will significantly outperform existing single-modality methods in predicting experimentally validated allosteric sites and pathways.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will benchmark our model's performance against established tools (e.g., AlloSite-Pro, SPACER) using curated datasets like ASBench. The primary metric will be the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) for identifying known allosteric sites. We will further validate the model by performing retrospective analyses on well-characterized allosteric drugs, predicting their binding sites and the communication pathways to the active site, and comparing these predictions with extensive experimental literature.

**Research Question 2: Do conserved architectural principles and recurring motifs ('design patterns') govern the wiring of allosteric networks across diverse protein families?**
Just as certain folds are reused throughout the proteome, it is plausible that nature has evolved common solutions for transmitting allosteric signals. Identifying these patterns would reveal fundamental principles of protein design and evolution.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** Allosteric communication pathways are not random walks but are enriched in specific structural motifs (e.g., chains of beta-strands, alpha-helical interfaces) and are composed of residues that are evolutionarily conserved and dynamically coupled. These pathways will exhibit topological similarities across unrelated proteins that share similar regulatory functions.
*   **Testing and Validation:** After computing allosteric pathways for the entire proteome, we will perform a large-scale statistical analysis to identify over-represented secondary structure elements, interface types, and residue properties within these pathways. We will use graph clustering algorithms to group proteins based on the topology of their allosteric networks and test whether these clusters correlate with functional classifications (e.g., GO terms, KEGG pathways) more strongly than simple fold-based classifications.

**Research Question 3: To what extent do disease-associated genetic variants, particularly those distal to functional sites, exert their pathogenic effects by disrupting allosteric communication?**
A significant challenge in clinical genetics is interpreting Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). We posit that a large fraction of these variants are 'allosteric mutations' that cause disease by subtly rewiring the internal communication of a protein.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** Pathogenic missense variants cataloged in ClinVar, especially those classified as VUS, are significantly more likely to map onto predicted allosteric pathways and disrupt network connectivity than benign population variants from gnomAD.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will develop a quantitative 'Allosteric Disruption Score' (ADS) that measures the predicted change in pathway integrity upon in silico mutation. We will compute this score for all variants in ClinVar and gnomAD. Our hypothesis will be confirmed if the distribution of ADS for pathogenic variants is statistically significantly higher than for benign variants. We will validate this by correlating high ADS scores with known loss-of-function or gain-of-function effects for specific disease-causing mutations documented in the literature (e.g., mutations in glucokinase causing diabetes or in FGFRs causing craniosynostosis).

**Expected Outcomes and Deliverables:** The successful completion of this project will yield: (1) A novel, open-source computational framework for multi-modal allostery prediction. (2) The 'Allosterome Atlas,' a public web portal for visualizing allosteric networks. (3) A comprehensive catalog of predicted allosteric sites and pathways for the human proteome. (4) A prioritized list of VUS reclassified based on their predicted impact on allosteric regulation. (5) Several high-impact publications detailing our methodology, findings, and the utility of the Atlas.

Methods And Approach

This project is a large-scale data synthesis effort that requires a multidisciplinary team and a phased, systematic approach. Our Working Group comprises experts in structural biology, computational chemistry, bioinformatics, and machine learning, ensuring all facets of the project are handled with rigor. The project is organized into three primary Aims.

**Aim 1: Curation and Synthesis of a Multi-Modal Proteome-Scale Dataset.**
The foundation of our project is the aggregation and harmonization of diverse, publicly available datasets into a unified data structure suitable for machine learning. 
*   **Data Sources:** We will leverage a comprehensive set of databases. (1) **Structural Data:** All human protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), supplemented by the complete human proteome from the AlphaFold Database (v4). (2) **Dynamic Data:** We will collate structural ensembles from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) and cryo-EM maps from the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). Crucially, we will mine public MD simulation repositories such as MDsrv, BioSimGrid, and the MoDEL database. For key protein families lacking dynamic data, we will perform new, standardized all-atom MD simulations (using GROMACS/AMBER with the CHARMM36m force field) on high-performance computing (HPC) resources. (3) **Evolutionary Data:** We will generate Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) for each protein family in Pfam and compute evolutionary couplings using established tools like EVcouplings and GREMLIN. (4) **Genetic and Functional Data:** We will use variant data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and functional site annotations (active sites, binding sites, PTMs) from UniProt and FireDB.
*   **Data Integration Pipeline:** We will develop an automated Snakemake workflow to process these data. For each protein, the pipeline will generate a unified graph representation. Residues will be nodes, and edges will represent spatial proximity, covalent bonds, and dynamic correlations. Each node and edge will be decorated with a rich feature vector containing information from all data modalities: static structural properties (secondary structure, solvent accessibility), dynamic properties (B-factors, RMSF from MD), evolutionary properties (conservation, co-evolutionary scores), and functional annotations.

**Aim 2: Development and Validation of a Geometric Deep Learning Framework for Allostery Prediction.**
We will develop a novel machine learning model to learn the principles of allosteric communication from our integrated dataset.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will employ a Geometric Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically an equivariant message-passing network (e.g., E(n)-GNN). This architecture is ideal as it naturally operates on 3D graph data and respects the rotational and translational symmetries inherent to protein structures. The model will take our multi-modal protein graphs as input and learn to predict an 'allosteric potential' score for each residue.
*   **Training:** The model will be trained in a supervised manner on a gold-standard set of ~500 proteins with experimentally validated allosteric sites curated from databases like ASBench and AlloReg. We will use a combination of binary cross-entropy loss for site prediction and self-supervised learning objectives to enforce biophysical realism.
*   **Pathway Identification:** Once trained, the model's learned edge weights will represent the strength of allosteric communication. We will apply graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) to this learned graph to identify the optimal, highest-probability communication pathways ('allosteric wires') between any two residues, such as a predicted allosteric site and a known active site.
*   **Validation:** The framework will be rigorously validated on a held-out test set. We will compare its performance to existing methods and conduct in-depth case studies on well-understood allosteric systems (e.g., GPCRs, kinases, nuclear hormone receptors) to ensure our predicted pathways align with experimental evidence from NMR, HDX-MS, and mutational studies.

**Aim 3: Proteome-Scale Deployment, Variant Impact Analysis, and Creation of the Allosterome Atlas.**
With a validated framework, we will perform the first-ever allosteric analysis of an entire proteome.
*   **High-Throughput Analysis:** The analysis pipeline will be deployed on HPC resources to predict allosteric sites and pathways for every protein in the human proteome.
*   **Variant Impact Scoring:** We will develop an in silico mutagenesis protocol within our framework. For each missense variant from ClinVar/gnomAD, we will compute an Allosteric Disruption Score (ADS) by quantifying the difference in network properties (e.g., pathway probabilities, centrality measures) between the wild-type and mutant protein graphs. This will allow us to systematically test Hypothesis 3.
*   **The Allosterome Atlas:** The final output will be a publicly accessible web portal. Built with modern frameworks (e.g., React, D3.js, NGL viewer), the Atlas will allow users to search for any human protein, visualize its structure annotated with predicted allosteric sites and pathways, and query the predicted allosteric impact of known genetic variants.

**Timeline:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data aggregation pipeline (M6). Develop and train initial GNN model prototype (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Finalize and validate the predictive framework (M18). Begin proteome-scale deployment (M20). Launch internal prototype of the Allosterome Atlas (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Complete proteome-wide analysis and variant scoring (M30). Populate and publicly launch the Allosterome Atlas (M32). Submit primary manuscripts for publication (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the molecular and cellular biosciences, with profound impacts on basic research, therapeutic development, and personalized medicine. Our contributions will extend far beyond the specific scientific questions addressed, creating a lasting resource and a new conceptual framework for the entire research community.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary outcome will be the **Allosterome Atlas**, the first-ever comprehensive map of allosteric communication networks across the human proteome. This represents a paradigm shift, moving the study of allostery from a qualitative, case-by-case analysis to a quantitative, systems-level science. This Atlas will serve as a new functional annotation layer for the human genome, providing mechanistic insights that are orthogonal to existing annotations like gene ontology or pathway databases. We will uncover the prevalence and diversity of allosteric regulation, potentially revealing that it is a far more ubiquitous mechanism than currently appreciated. Our large-scale analysis will identify conserved 'design principles' of allosteric communication—common structural motifs and network topologies that nature has evolved to transmit information within proteins. This will provide fundamental insights into protein evolution and biophysics.

Methodologically, we will deliver a novel, open-source **multi-modal deep learning framework**. This framework, which integrates structural, dynamic, and evolutionary data, will be a significant contribution to computational biology. Its success will demonstrate the power of data synthesis and will be adaptable to other challenging problems in protein science, such as predicting the effects of post-translational modifications or designing protein-protein interactions.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The societal and economic impacts of this research will be substantial, particularly in medicine and biotechnology.
*   **Revolutionizing Drug Discovery:** The Allosterome Atlas will be a powerful engine for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Allosteric drugs offer significant advantages over traditional active-site inhibitors, including higher specificity and the ability to modulate, rather than simply block, protein function. Our Atlas will systematically reveal previously unknown allosteric sites on thousands of proteins, including high-value targets that have been deemed 'undruggable' due to flat, featureless active sites (e.g., transcription factors, scaffolding proteins). This will open up vast new therapeutic opportunities for cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic diseases.
*   **Advancing Personalized Medicine:** Our framework for calculating an 'Allosteric Disruption Score' for genetic variants will have a direct clinical impact. It will provide a powerful tool for interpreting the functional consequences of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) identified in patient genomes. By providing a mechanistic hypothesis—disruption of allosteric regulation—we can help reclassify VUS, improve diagnostic accuracy, and guide the development of personalized therapies.
*   **Enabling Rational Protein Engineering:** A detailed map of a protein's internal 'wiring' is invaluable for protein engineering. Researchers in synthetic biology and biotechnology can use the Atlas to rationally design mutations that fine-tune protein activity, stability, or substrate specificity for applications ranging from industrial enzyme production to the development of novel biosensors.

**Dissemination, Data Sharing, and Training:**
In line with the research call's emphasis on open science, all outcomes will be made broadly and freely available. The Allosterome Atlas will be a public, user-friendly web portal. All software will be released as open-source code on GitHub, and all generated data will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo). We plan to publish our findings in high-impact journals (e.g., Nature, Cell) and present at major international conferences. Furthermore, this project is an ideal training vehicle. The graduate students and postdocs in the Working Group will receive unique cross-disciplinary training at the interface of biophysics, data science, and genomics, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy workforce. We will host annual workshops to train the broader community on using our tools and resources, ensuring maximum impact and fostering a collaborative ecosystem around the study of the allosterome.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory. Its successful execution requires the deep integration of expertise from four distinct scientific domains—structural biology, computational chemistry, bioinformatics, and machine learning—and the synthesis of petabyte-scale public datasets. The computational demands for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, deep learning model training on 3D graph data, and the analysis of the entire human proteome far exceed the resources typically available to individual PIs. Therefore, the support and collaborative framework provided by NCEMS are essential for the project's feasibility and success.

**Budget Justification (3-Year Project Total: $1,250,000)**

*   **A. Personnel ($780,000):** The intellectual core of the project will be driven by dedicated trainees. We request support for two Postdoctoral Scholars for three years ($100,000/yr each, salary + fringe). One postdoc will have expertise in molecular dynamics and computational biophysics, leading the dynamic data generation and analysis. The second postdoc will be a machine learning expert responsible for developing and implementing the geometric GNN framework. We also request support for two Graduate Student Research Assistants for three years ($60,000/yr each, stipend, tuition, fees). These students will focus on the data integration pipeline and the development of the Allosterome Atlas web portal, respectively. Finally, we request one month of summer salary per year for each of the four collaborating PIs ($15,000/PI/yr) to support their dedicated effort in project oversight, management, and trainee mentorship.

*   **E. Indirect Costs (F&A) ($140,000):** This is an estimated amount based on a blended rate across the collaborating institutions and is subject to negotiation based on the final direct cost base. This support is critical for the institutional infrastructure that enables this research.",,
ai_single_scientist_gemini_05,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,Emergence of Robustness and Plasticity in Cellular Signaling Networks,"Cellular signaling networks face a fundamental design challenge: they must be robust enough to buffer against noise and perturbations, yet plastic enough to adapt to new environmental cues. How these dual, seemingly contradictory, emergent properties arise from the underlying molecular interactions is a central puzzle in systems biology. This Working Group will address this question by synthesizing diverse, large-scale public datasets to uncover the general design principles of robust and plastic networks. We will integrate phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic time-series data following various perturbations (e.g., from LINCS, GEO), comprehensive protein-protein interaction maps (BioGRID, IntAct), and kinetic parameters curated from the literature (SABIO-RK). Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, mathematicians specializing in dynamical systems, control theory engineers, and computational scientists will develop and apply novel analytical strategies. We will use network topology analysis, information theory, and machine learning-based parameter inference to build predictive dynamical models of key signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, NF-κB). By comparing network architectures and dynamics across different pathways and organisms, we will identify recurring motifs, feedback/feedforward loop structures, and parameter regimes that confer robustness versus plasticity. The project will deliver a set of generalizable principles that explain how cells achieve this critical balance, with profound implications for understanding diseases where signaling is dysregulated (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders) and for the rational design of synthetic biological circuits.",,"Background And Significance

Cellular life depends on the faithful transmission and processing of information. Signaling networks are the intricate communication systems that allow cells to sense their environment and internal state, and to execute appropriate responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. A central challenge in the design of these networks is the need to balance two opposing emergent properties: robustness and plasticity. Robustness is the ability to maintain stable function and produce a reliable output despite perturbations, such as thermal noise, stochastic fluctuations in component concentrations, or genetic mutations. This property ensures the fidelity of critical cellular processes. Conversely, plasticity, or adaptability, is the capacity to alter signaling responses in the face of new or persistent environmental cues, enabling cells to learn from experience and adapt to changing conditions. How cells achieve this delicate and seemingly paradoxical balance is a fundamental, unanswered question in molecular and cellular biology.

Early work in systems biology identified key network motifs that contribute to specific dynamic behaviors. Negative feedback loops (NFLs) were shown to promote homeostasis and accelerate response times, key features of robust systems. Positive feedback loops (PFLs) were found to generate bistability and ultrasensitivity, enabling switch-like, decisive cell fate decisions. Incoherent feedforward loops (FFLs) can act as pulse generators or fold-change detectors, buffering against fluctuations in input signal amplitude. These foundational studies, pioneered by researchers like Uri Alon and others, provided a 'parts list' of network motifs, but a comprehensive understanding of how these parts are assembled into systems that are simultaneously robust and plastic remains elusive. Seminal studies have provided deep insights into individual pathways. For instance, the work of Barkai and Leibler on yeast chemotaxis demonstrated perfect adaptation, a powerful form of robustness, achieved through integral feedback control. Similarly, the oscillatory dynamics of the NF-κB transcription factor, elucidated by Hoffmann and colleagues, revealed how temporal coding can regulate gene expression, a mechanism that blends robust signal transmission with plastic, context-dependent interpretation.

Despite these advances, the field faces significant limitations that this Working Group is uniquely positioned to address. First, most research has been siloed, focusing intensely on a single pathway in a specific model organism. This has yielded deep but narrow insights, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the generalizable principles that govern signaling network design across diverse biological contexts. Second, many analyses have relied on static protein-protein interaction maps, which ignore the highly dynamic and context-dependent nature of signaling. Third, the construction of predictive dynamical models, which are essential for understanding emergent properties, has been severely hampered by the 'curse of dimensionality' and the scarcity of well-constrained kinetic parameters. Finally, the explosion of publicly available high-throughput data—including transcriptomic and proteomic time-series—has created an unprecedented opportunity for a synthesis-based approach, yet these datasets are often heterogeneous and noisy, requiring sophisticated integration strategies beyond the scope of a single research lab.

This research is therefore both important and timely. It is important because a failure to properly balance robustness and plasticity is a hallmark of numerous human diseases. In cancer, signaling pathways become pathologically robust, locked into a proliferative state and resistant to apoptotic signals. In autoimmune diseases, immune cell signaling can become hyper-plastic, overreacting to self-antigens. A principled understanding of how this balance is achieved could unveil novel therapeutic strategies aimed at re-tuning network dynamics rather than simply inhibiting a single protein. The research is timely because we are at a confluence of data availability and methodological innovation. The maturation of public data repositories like GEO, LINCS, and BioGRID, combined with advances in machine learning for parameter inference and network science, makes it possible, for the first time, to systematically compare network architectures and dynamics across dozens of pathways and cell types. This project will synthesize these disparate resources to extract fundamental design principles, moving the field from a descriptive to a predictive science of cellular signaling.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to elucidate the generalizable design principles that enable cellular signaling networks to simultaneously achieve robustness and plasticity. To address this complex challenge, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each associated with a set of testable hypotheses that will guide our data synthesis and modeling efforts.

**Research Question 1 (RQ1): How do network topology and modular organization quantitatively contribute to the balance between robustness and plasticity?**
While specific motifs like feedback loops are known to influence network behavior, a systematic, cross-pathway understanding of how entire network architectures are tuned for robustness versus plasticity is lacking. We hypothesize that these two properties are encoded in distinct, quantifiable features of the network graph.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Robustness to intrinsic noise and parameter variation is primarily conferred by a high density of fast-acting negative feedback loops and incoherent feedforward loops. We predict that pathways known for homeostatic function (e.g., metabolic regulation) will show significant enrichment for these motifs compared to pathways involved in developmental decision-making.
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** Plasticity is enabled by a modular network structure. We hypothesize that networks are organized into a robust 'core' module responsible for signal propagation, which is peripherally regulated by 'tuning' modules. These tuning modules, often containing positive feedback loops and slower transcriptional components, can re-wire or re-parameterize the core response without compromising its fundamental integrity. We predict that the degree of modularity will correlate with the known adaptive capacity of a given pathway.
*   **Validation:** We will test these hypotheses by performing a large-scale comparative analysis of network topologies reconstructed from integrated public data. We will quantify motif enrichment and modularity scores for dozens of signaling pathways and correlate these topological metrics with functional measures of robustness (e.g., low cell-to-cell response variability from single-cell data) and plasticity (e.g., the degree of adaptive desensitization from time-series data).

**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the dynamic and information-theoretic principles that govern the trade-off between reliable signal transmission and adaptive capacity?**
Signaling networks are not just wires, but information channels. How they process information dynamically is key to their function. We propose that the robustness-plasticity trade-off can be rigorously framed using the language of information theory.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Robust signaling pathways operate as high-fidelity communication channels optimized to maximize mutual information between a specific input and its downstream output. Plasticity, in this framework, represents a mechanism for dynamically reallocating the channel's bandwidth, for instance, by changing its sensitivity or dynamic range in response to a secondary, contextual cue.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The temporal coding of signals is a key mechanism for separating robust and plastic responses. We hypothesize that robust, essential information is encoded in simple, easily decodable features (e.g., signal amplitude), while plastic, adaptive information is encoded in more complex dynamic features (e.g., frequency, pulse duration), as exemplified by the MAPK and NF-κB systems, respectively.
*   **Validation:** We will apply information-theoretic tools to the curated time-series datasets to quantify the channel capacity of different pathways. We will build dynamical models to simulate how network modifications affect information flow. By comparing pathways with different known functions, we will test whether their dynamic encoding strategies align with our predictions.

**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How do kinetic parameter landscapes and multi-scale feedback determine whether a network operates in a robust or plastic regime?**
The structure of a network defines its potential behaviors, but the specific kinetic parameters determine its actual function. We hypothesize that robustness and plasticity are emergent properties of the system's location in a high-dimensional parameter space.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** Robustness arises when a system operates in a 'flat' region of its parameter landscape, where the system's output is insensitive to large variations in most individual kinetic parameters. This property, known as structural robustness, is often achieved through mechanisms like enzyme saturation and integral feedback.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** Plasticity is enabled by the existence of nearby bifurcations in the parameter space. We predict that slow-acting feedback loops (e.g., transcriptional regulation) can push the system across these bifurcations, causing qualitative shifts in its dynamic behavior (e.g., from a stable steady state to an oscillation or a bistable switch), which underlies long-term adaptation.
*   **Validation:** Using machine learning-based inference on time-series data, we will estimate posterior distributions for the parameters of our dynamical models. We will then perform global sensitivity analysis (e.g., Sobol indices) to identify sloppy vs. stiff parameter directions, testing Hypothesis 3a. We will use bifurcation analysis to map the dynamic regimes of our models and identify the parameters that act as 'levers' for plasticity, testing Hypothesis 3b.

Methods And Approach

Our research plan is a multi-pronged, integrative strategy designed to systematically address our research questions. The project is organized into four sequential but interconnected aims, forming a comprehensive workflow from data aggregation to the generation of generalizable principles. This project will exclusively use publicly available data, in full compliance with the research call.

**Aim 1: Data Curation, Integration, and Construction of a Pan-Pathway Signaling Atlas.**
The foundation of this project is the synthesis of diverse, large-scale datasets. We will develop a reproducible computational pipeline using Nextflow to automate the retrieval, processing, and normalization of data from multiple public repositories.
*   **Data Sources:** We will target three main classes of data. (1) **Dynamic Response Data:** Time-series transcriptomic (from GEO and ArrayExpress) and phosphoproteomic (from PRIDE, CPTAC, and the LINCS L1000/P100 projects) data capturing cellular responses to a wide range of perturbations (e.g., growth factors, cytokines, small molecule inhibitors) in well-characterized human cell lines (e.g., MCF7, HeLa, A549). (2) **Network Scaffolds:** Comprehensive protein-protein interaction data from BioGRID and IntAct, kinase-substrate interactions from PhosphoSitePlus and SIGNOR, and transcription factor-target interactions from ENCODE and TRRUST. (3) **Kinetic Parameters:** Experimentally measured enzyme kinetic parameters (Km, kcat, Ki) from SABIO-RK and BRENDA will be curated to serve as priors for our dynamic models.
*   **Integration:** Raw data will be processed into a standardized format. Interaction data will be integrated using a weighted scheme, where edge weights reflect the amount and type of evidence. This will result in a comprehensive, multi-layered 'Signaling Atlas' that will serve as the foundational data structure for all subsequent analyses. All processing steps will be containerized (e.g., using Docker) to ensure full reproducibility.

**Aim 2: Comparative Topological and Information-Theoretic Analysis.**
Using the Signaling Atlas, we will extract context-specific networks for canonical signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, TGF-β) and perform systematic analyses to test Hypotheses 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b.
*   **Topological Analysis:** For each pathway, we will use established algorithms implemented in Python libraries (NetworkX) and Cytoscape to quantify global network properties (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient) and local features. We will employ motif-finding algorithms (e.g., mfinder) to detect the enrichment of feedback and feedforward loops. Community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain) will be used to identify modular structures and test Hypothesis 1b.
*   **Information-Theoretic Analysis:** We will apply methods from information theory to the curated time-series data. Mutual information will be calculated between stimulus and response time-series to estimate the channel capacity of each pathway. Transfer entropy will be used to infer the direction and magnitude of information flow between network components, providing a dynamic, data-driven view of network connectivity.

**Aim 3: Development, Parameterization, and Analysis of Predictive Dynamical Models.**
To move beyond static correlations and understand mechanism, we will build and analyze mechanistic models of core signaling modules.
*   **Model Formulation:** We will use Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) as our primary modeling formalism, leveraging tools like PySB for programmatic model construction. This allows us to explicitly represent biochemical reactions and their kinetics. For each pathway, we will construct a series of models of increasing complexity, starting with a core topology and adding regulatory loops.
*   **Parameter Inference:** This is a critical challenge we will address with state-of-the-art methods. We will employ Bayesian inference, specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (e.g., via the PyMC library), to fit our ODE models to the relevant time-series data. This approach has two key advantages: it can integrate prior knowledge (from SABIO-RK), and it yields full posterior distributions for each parameter, naturally capturing our uncertainty. This probabilistic approach is essential for robustly testing our hypotheses about parameter landscapes.
*   **Model Analysis:** Once parameterized, the models will be our primary tool for in silico experimentation. We will perform global sensitivity analysis to identify stiff (plasticity-conferring) and sloppy (robustness-conferring) parameter combinations. Bifurcation analysis will be used to map the different dynamic regimes (e.g., stable, bistable, oscillatory) accessible to the network, revealing the mechanisms of plasticity. We will simulate the models under noisy conditions to quantify robustness and directly test its relationship with topological and parametric features.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete the data processing pipeline and release version 1.0 of the Signaling Atlas. Perform initial topological and information-theoretic analyses across 5-10 pathways. Publish a data descriptor paper.
*   **Year 2:** Develop and parameterize robust dynamical models for 3-4 core pathways (e.g., ERK, NF-κB). Perform initial sensitivity and bifurcation analyses. Hold the first in-person Working Group meeting to synthesize results. Present preliminary findings at a major conference.
*   **Year 3:** Expand modeling to a larger set of pathways. Conduct the final cross-pathway comparative analysis to synthesize general principles. Prepare and submit manuscripts to high-impact journals. Release all models, code, and analysis workflows as a comprehensive, open-source package. Hold the final Working Group meeting.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to produce a series of high-impact outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, while also providing valuable resources and training opportunities for the broader scientific community.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary intellectual contribution will be the elucidation of a set of generalizable design principles that explain how cellular signaling networks resolve the fundamental trade-off between robustness and plasticity. This will represent a significant step towards a predictive understanding of cellular regulation. By moving beyond the study of single pathways, our comparative, synthesis-based approach will uncover common strategies that cells use to manage information, providing a unifying framework for systems biology. We expect to deliver:
1.  **A Quantitative Catalog of Design Principles:** A set of rules linking specific network topologies (e.g., motif combinations, modularity), dynamic strategies (e.g., temporal coding), and parameter landscapes (e.g., sloppiness, proximity to bifurcations) to the emergent properties of robustness and plasticity.
2.  **A Novel, Integrative Analytical Framework:** A fully documented, open-source computational pipeline for integrating multi-modal 'omics data to construct, parameterize, and analyze dynamical models of signaling networks. This will lower the barrier for other researchers to conduct similar synthesis projects.
3.  **A Rich Community Resource:** The curated Pan-Pathway Signaling Atlas and the library of validated, parameterized models will be made publicly available through a user-friendly web portal. This will serve as a foundational resource for hypothesis generation and in silico experimentation by the wider cell biology community.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The implications of this research extend far beyond basic science. Understanding the principles of robust and plastic design has profound relevance for human health and biotechnology.
*   **Translational Medicine:** The dysregulation of signaling robustness and plasticity is a root cause of many diseases. In cancer, pathways become rigidly robust to death signals; in autoimmune disorders, they are excessively plastic and hyper-responsive. Our findings will provide a 'network-level' perspective on disease, identifying novel therapeutic targets and strategies. For example, instead of simply inhibiting a kinase, one might design drugs that push a network away from a pathologically robust state, re-sensitizing it to other treatments. This aligns with the growing field of network medicine.
*   **Synthetic Biology:** The rational design of synthetic biological circuits is often hampered by their fragility and lack of adaptability. Our work will provide a 'design manual' for engineers to build more sophisticated and reliable circuits. By incorporating the principles of robustness and plasticity we uncover, synthetic biologists can create cells with novel functions, such as smart therapeutics that can adapt their behavior to the state of a patient's disease or robust biosensors for environmental monitoring.
*   **Training and Education:** This project is an ideal training vehicle for the next generation of data-savvy scientists. Trainees involved will gain a unique, interdisciplinary skillset spanning data science, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, and systems biology. The collaborative Working Group structure will foster team science and provide mentorship opportunities for graduate students and postdocs from PIs with diverse expertise.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
We are deeply committed to the principles of open and reproducible science. All products of this research will be made rapidly and broadly available.
*   **Publications:** We will publish our findings in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Cell Systems, Nature Communications). We will budget for open-access fees to ensure maximum accessibility.
*   **Public Repositories:** All code will be developed in a version-controlled GitHub repository with a permissive open-source license. All curated data and models will be deposited in community-standard repositories like Zenodo, GEO, and the BioModels Database, with rich metadata to ensure they are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).
*   **Community Engagement:** We will present our work at national and international conferences (e.g., ISMB, Q-Bio) and will organize workshops and tutorials to train the community on how to use our software and data resources. This will ensure the long-term impact and sustainability of our work.

ai_single_scientist_gemini_06,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,Reconstructing Eukaryogenesis: A Data-Driven Synthesis of the Great Evolutionary Transition,"The origin of the eukaryotic cell, with its nucleus, mitochondria, and complex endomembrane system, represents one of the most profound and enigmatic emergent events in the history of life. While hypotheses abound, a comprehensive, data-driven reconstruction of this transition is lacking. This Working Group will synthesize the explosion of genomic, proteomic, and structural data from across the tree of life to build a detailed, step-by-step model of eukaryogenesis. We will integrate complete genomes and proteomes from diverse eukaryotes, archaea (with a focus on the recently discovered Asgardarchaeota, our closest prokaryotic relatives), and bacteria from NCBI and UniProt. This will be combined with protein family phylogenies (OrthoDB), and a vast repository of protein structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB) to trace the origin and evolution of key eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs) involved in membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and nuclear organization. Our team, a unique collaboration of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, structural bioinformaticians, and computational phylogenomicists, will use sophisticated computational methods to reconstruct ancestral protein functions and interaction networks. We aim to pinpoint the specific molecular innovations and horizontal gene transfers that enabled the emergence of eukaryotic complexity, resolving long-standing debates about the roles of endosymbiosis and autogenous evolution. This project will produce the most detailed data-synthesized narrative of our own cellular origins, providing a foundational resource for understanding the principles of biological innovation.",,"Background And Significance

The emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic ancestors stands as one of the most significant and complex events in evolutionary history, a true singularity that paved the way for all macroscopic life. This transition involved a radical increase in cellular complexity, including the origin of the nucleus, mitochondria, a dynamic endomembrane system, a versatile cytoskeleton, and linear chromosomes. Understanding this 'great evolutionary transition' is not merely a historical curiosity; it is fundamental to comprehending the principles that govern biological innovation and the emergence of complexity from simpler components. For decades, the field has been dominated by conceptual models, often based on limited, fragmentary evidence. The classic endosymbiotic theory, championed by Lynn Margulis, correctly identified the bacterial origin of mitochondria, but the nature of the host cell and the sequence of events that led to its complex architecture have remained fiercely debated. Broadly, hypotheses fall into two camps: autogenous models, which propose that complexity arose gradually within a single prokaryotic lineage before any major symbiotic event, and symbiogenetic models, which posit that the symbiotic merger itself was the catalyst for complexification. The 'inside-out' model, for instance, is a sophisticated autogenous theory suggesting that the nucleus and cytoplasm evolved from extracellular blebs formed by an archaeal ancestor. Conversely, symbiogenetic models like the 'hydrogen hypothesis' argue that the metabolic dependency between an archaeal host and a hydrogen-producing alphaproteobacterial symbiont drove the engulfment that initiated eukaryogenesis. A central point of contention has been the 'mitochondria-early' versus 'mitochondria-late' debate: did a complex 'proto-eukaryote' engulf the mitochondrion, or did the energy and genetic material from the endosymbiont fuel the evolution of complexity? The discovery of the Asgardarchaeota superphylum has revolutionized this field. Phylogenomic analyses by Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al. (2017) and others have robustly placed the eukaryotic lineage as a sister group to, or branching from within, the Asgardarchaeota. This discovery effectively ended the three-domain debate in favor of a two-domain tree of life, confirming the archaeal nature of the host cell. Crucially, Asgardarchaeal genomes contain an unprecedented number of 'eukaryotic signature proteins' (ESPs)—genes previously thought to be unique to eukaryotes. These include homologs of actin, tubulin, ESCRT proteins involved in membrane remodeling, and components of the ubiquitin system. This finding suggests the host was not a simple, passive partner but was 'primed' with a toolkit of proteins that could be co-opted for eukaryotic functions. However, this discovery has also raised new, more nuanced questions. What were these proteins doing in a prokaryotic context? How were their functions repurposed during eukaryogenesis? Did the Asgard ancestor possess a rudimentary cytoskeleton or endomembrane system? Answering these questions requires moving beyond simply cataloging genes. The key gap in our current knowledge is the lack of a holistic, integrated model that connects the evolution of genes to the evolution of cellular systems and functions. Previous studies have often focused on individual protein families or specific cellular processes in isolation. A comprehensive synthesis that integrates genomic, phylogenetic, structural, and functional data is required to reconstruct the step-by-step emergence of the eukaryotic cell. This project is exceptionally timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the torrent of publicly available genomic data from diverse microbial eukaryotes and newly discovered prokaryotic lineages provides an unprecedented dataset for comparative analysis. Second, the advent of highly accurate protein structure prediction through AlphaFold has opened the door to inferring the function of ancestral proteins for which no experimental data exists. Third, advances in computational phylogenetics and network biology provide the analytical tools necessary to synthesize these heterogeneous datasets. This project will leverage these advances to build the first data-driven, systems-level reconstruction of our own cellular origins, addressing a foundational question in molecular and cellular biosciences.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to synthesize publicly available data to construct a high-resolution, temporally-ordered model of the molecular events that transpired during the transition from a prokaryotic ancestor to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). We will move beyond qualitative models to a quantitative, evidence-based reconstruction of this emergent phenomenon. To achieve this, we have formulated four central research questions (RQs), each associated with specific, testable hypotheses.

**RQ1: What was the molecular toolkit of the Asgard-eukaryote common ancestor, and how did it function in a prokaryotic context?** While we know Asgardarchaeota possess many ESPs, their ancestral functions and interactions remain unknown. We aim to reconstruct the ancestral proteome and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to understand the cellular capabilities of the eukaryotic host just before the mitochondrial endosymbiosis.
*   **Hypothesis 1 (The 'Primed Host' Hypothesis):** The Asgardarchaeal ancestor of eukaryotes already possessed a rudimentary, dynamic cytoskeleton and a basic membrane-remodeling system, which were essential prerequisites for engulfing the proto-mitochondrion. This system was likely involved in generating cell surface complexity and interacting with the environment.
    *   *Prediction:* Ancestral state reconstruction will place the origin of key membrane-remodeling proteins (e.g., ESCRTs, BAR domains) and profilin/gelsolin-regulated actin homologs *before* the massive influx of genes from the alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. Ancestral protein structure modeling will show that these proteins had the core biophysical properties (e.g., membrane curvature sensing, filament polymerization) necessary for these functions.

**RQ2: How did the acquisition and integration of the alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont reshape the host's proteome and cellular architecture?** The endosymbiosis was not just a metabolic merger but also a massive genetic event, involving the transfer of hundreds of genes from the endosymbiont to the host genome (Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer, EGT). We will trace the impact of this event on the host's genetic and network evolution.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (The 'Symbiotic Catalyst' Hypothesis):** The endosymbiotic event was the primary trigger for the evolution of eukaryotic complexity. The bioenergetic boost from the proto-mitochondrion and the genetic disruption caused by EGT catalyzed the formation of the nucleus and the expansion of the endomembrane system.
    *   *Prediction:* Phylogenomic dating and analysis of gene family expansions will reveal a major burst of innovation and duplication in ESPs associated with the nucleus (e.g., lamins, nuclear pore components), endomembrane trafficking (e.g., Rab GTPases, SNAREs), and cell division *after* the integration of the mitochondrial ancestor. We predict that many key eukaryotic innovations will be genetic chimeras, combining archaeal information-processing machinery with bacterial-derived metabolic and membrane-associated components.

**RQ3: What was the evolutionary trajectory of key eukaryotic cellular systems, such as the nucleus and endomembrane system?** The origin of the nucleus is perhaps the greatest single puzzle in cell biology. We will investigate its emergence by tracing the origin of its constituent components and their integration into a functional whole.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (The 'Membrane Proliferation' Hypothesis for Nuclear Origin):** The nuclear envelope did not evolve primarily for genome protection but arose as a consequence of the proliferation of internal membranes that wrapped around the host's chromatin to manage the influx of mitochondrial-derived lipids and proteins, effectively sorting the cell into new compartments.
    *   *Prediction:* The core components of the nuclear pore complex and nuclear lamina will be traced back to ancestral proteins involved in membrane coating and remodeling (e.g., vesicle-coating proteins) and cytoskeletal elements present in the Asgard ancestor. Their recruitment to form the nucleus will coincide phylogenetically with the expansion of protein families involved in lipid metabolism and transport that have a clear alphaproteobacterial origin.

**RQ4: Can we resolve the 'mitochondria-early' vs. 'mitochondria-late' debate through data synthesis?** By creating a relative timeline of molecular innovations, we can determine if significant host complexity preceded or followed the endosymbiotic event.
*   **Hypothesis 4 (The 'Staggered Innovation' Hypothesis):** The evolution of eukaryotic complexity was a multi-stage process. We hypothesize that the host was 'primed' with basic cytoskeletal and membrane-remodeling abilities (supporting a 'late' engulfment), but that the vast majority of eukaryotic innovations, including the nucleus and complex vesicle trafficking, evolved *after* the endosymbiotic event (supporting a 'mitochondria-early' trigger).
    *   *Prediction:* Our integrated timeline will show that genes for basic actin regulation and ESCRT-like systems are ancient within Asgardarchaeota, while the major expansions of regulatory families like small GTPases, protein kinases, and ubiquitin ligases, which orchestrate complex eukaryotic processes, occurred on the branch leading to LECA, subsequent to the mitochondrial acquisition event. This will be our key deliverable: a data-supported, step-by-step model of eukaryogenesis.

Methods And Approach

This project is founded on the principle of data synthesis, integrating vast, publicly available datasets using a rigorous, multi-phase computational pipeline. Our approach is designed to be reproducible, transparent, and scalable, leveraging the diverse expertise of our Working Group. The project is structured around four major phases, with clear milestones and deliverables.

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Acquisition and Curation (Months 1-6)**
This foundational phase involves assembling a high-quality, consistent, and comprehensive dataset. This task is non-trivial and requires significant bioinformatic effort, representing a key contribution in itself.
*   **Genomic and Proteomic Data:** We will compile a curated set of approximately 500 complete genomes and their corresponding proteomes. This dataset will include: ~200 diverse eukaryotes spanning all major supergroups (from NCBI RefSeq, JGI, and the EukProt database) to robustly define the LECA proteome; ~150 archaeal genomes, with an exhaustive sampling of all known Asgardarchaeota phyla (Loki-, Thor-, Odin-, Heimdallarchaeota) to model the host ancestor; and ~150 bacterial genomes, with a deep sampling of Alphaproteobacteria (to model the endosymbiont) and other phyla relevant for detecting horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
*   **Protein Family and Structural Data:** We will define orthologous groups (OGs) across our curated proteomes using the eggNOG and OrthoDB databases and associated software (eggNOG-mapper). For each protein, we will retrieve experimental structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and predicted structures from the AlphaFold Database. This structural dataset, encompassing millions of protein models, is critical for our functional inference pipeline.
*   **Data Management:** All raw and processed data will be managed in a centralized, version-controlled system using a combination of a relational database (PostgreSQL) for metadata and Git-LFS (Large File Storage) for sequence and structure files. This ensures full reproducibility and facilitates seamless collaboration across the Working Group.

**Phase 2: Phylogenomic Reconstruction and Ancestral Proteome Inference (Months 6-18)**
This phase aims to establish the evolutionary framework upon which all subsequent analyses will be built.
*   **Species Tree Construction:** We will construct a robust species tree from a concatenated alignment of ~100 universal, single-copy marker proteins. We will use state-of-the-art phylogenetic inference methods, such as IQ-TREE, employing complex mixture models (e.g., C60+LG+R) to account for site-specific evolutionary rates, which is crucial for resolving deep evolutionary relationships.
*   **Gene Family Evolution:** For each of the tens of thousands of OGs, we will build a maximum-likelihood gene tree. These gene trees will be reconciled with the species tree using tools like GeneRax, which co-infers gene trees and reconciliations. This process will allow us to systematically map events of gene duplication, loss, and HGT onto each branch of the species tree.
*   **Ancestral Proteome Reconstruction:** Using the reconciled phylogenies, we will employ probabilistic ancestral state reconstruction methods (e.g., using the Count software package) to infer the gene content of key ancestral nodes, most importantly the Asgard-eukaryote common ancestor and LECA. This will provide a complete parts list for these ancient organisms, directly addressing RQ1.

**Phase 3: Ancestral Function and Network Reconstruction (Months 12-24)**
Here, we move from gene content to cellular function and organization.
*   **Ancestral Sequence and Structure Reconstruction:** For high-priority ESP families (e.g., actins, tubulins, ESCRTs, Rab GTPases), we will reconstruct ancestral protein sequences using marginal reconstruction methods in PAML or FastML. We will then predict the 3D structures of these ancestral proteins using AlphaFold2. By comparing these ancestral structures to modern homologs using tools like DALI and TM-align, and by analyzing conserved functional sites, we will infer their ancestral biochemical functions, testing predictions from H1 and H3.
*   **Ancestral Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network Inference:** Reconstructing ancestral networks is a major challenge. We will use a multi-pronged, evidence-integration approach. We will infer interactions based on: (1) co-evolution of interacting partners across the species tree (e.g., using Mirrortree); (2) conservation of domain-domain interactions from databases like 3did and iPfam; and (3) structural modeling of potential protein complexes using AlphaFold-Multimer. By projecting these inferred interactions back onto the ancestral proteomes, we will generate probabilistic PPI networks for the Asgard-eukaryote ancestor and LECA, allowing us to test H2 and H3 by tracking the emergence of new network hubs and modules.

**Phase 4: Synthesis, Visualization, and Dissemination (Months 24-36)**
*   **Integrated Model of Eukaryogenesis:** In the final year, we will integrate the results from all phases—the ancestral proteomes, the functional evolution of key proteins, and the rewiring of interaction networks—into a coherent, temporally-ordered narrative of eukaryogenesis. This synthesis will directly address RQ4 and our overarching goal.
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   **M1 (Month 6):** Curated and versioned dataset of genomes, proteomes, and structures is complete and accessible to the team.
    *   **M2 (Month 18):** Robust species tree and reconstructed ancestral proteomes for key nodes (Asgard-eukaryote ancestor, LECA) are finalized.
    *   **M3 (Month 24):** Ancestral sequence and structural analysis of 50 key ESP families is complete.
    *   **M4 (Month 30):** First draft of ancestral PPI networks is complete; integration and synthesis begins.
    *   **M5 (Month 36):** Project completion, including submission of key manuscripts and launch of the public data portal.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology by providing the most detailed, data-driven account of the origin of eukaryotic life. The outcomes will extend beyond a single historical narrative, establishing a new paradigm for evolutionary systems biology and providing invaluable resources and training for the scientific community.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Quantitative, Step-by-Step Model of Eukaryogenesis:** The primary outcome will be a comprehensive, phylogenetically-ordered model detailing the sequence of molecular innovations—gene gains, duplications, HGTs, and network rewiring—that led to the eukaryotic cell. This will shift the field from debating abstract, competing hypotheses to refining a quantitative, evidence-based framework. We will produce a 'roadmap' of eukaryogenesis that pinpoints the likely functions of prokaryotic precursors and traces their transformation into the complex machinery of LECA.
2.  **Resolution of Foundational Controversies:** Our integrated approach is specifically designed to generate evidence that can resolve long-standing debates. By establishing a relative timeline of events, we will directly address the 'mitochondria-early vs. late' problem (testing H4). By reconstructing ancestral networks, we will quantify the relative contributions of pre-existing 'primed' systems versus symbiotic catalysts (testing H1 vs. H2), providing a nuanced answer that moves beyond a simple dichotomy.
3.  **A Foundational, Publicly-Accessible Resource:** A major deliverable will be the creation of an interactive, web-accessible database and visualization portal. This 'Eukaryogenesis Explorer' will allow any researcher to query the evolutionary history of any eukaryotic protein family in our dataset, view its reconstructed ancestral sequences and structures, and explore its placement within ancestral interaction networks. This will be an enduring resource for the cell biology, evolutionary biology, and genomics communities, enabling countless new hypotheses to be generated and explored. It will serve as a dynamic, evolving platform for understanding cellular origins.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This project is an ideal training environment that directly aligns with the research call's objectives. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work at the intersection of evolutionary biology, cell biology, and computational science. They will be co-mentored by PIs from different disciplines, participate in collaborative 'code-a-thons' and data analysis workshops, and lead different facets of the project. This cross-disciplinary, team-based training will equip them with the unique skillset required to lead future research in an increasingly data-intensive world.
2.  **Establishing a Methodological Blueprint for Synthesis Research:** Our project will pioneer and formalize a computational workflow for integrating phylogenomics with structural and network biology to reconstruct the evolution of a complex system. All our code, analysis pipelines, and workflows will be open-source and meticulously documented. This will provide a powerful blueprint for other research communities wishing to tackle different major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of multicellularity, neurons, or photosynthesis.
3.  **Dissemination and Open Science:** We are deeply committed to open science principles. All curated datasets, analysis scripts, and results will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo) upon publication. We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications (targeting journals like *Nature*, *Science*, and *eLife*), presentations at major international conferences (e.g., Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, American Society for Cell Biology), and a final project workshop to which we will invite the broader community. This ensures our results and methods have the maximum possible impact and utility.

**Long-Term Vision:** This project will lay the foundation for a new field of 'paleo-systems biology'. The resources we create—ancestral sequences, structures, and networks—will enable a new phase of experimental validation. For example, future studies could involve resurrecting ancestral proteins in the lab to test their predicted functions or attempting to engineer simplified prokaryotic systems with reconstructed eukaryotic-like modules. The collaborative network formed by this Working Group will persist beyond the funding period, creating a lasting intellectual hub for tackling the grand challenges of evolutionary biology.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory. Its success hinges on the deep integration of diverse expertise—phylogenomics, cell biology, structural bioinformatics, and network science—and requires dedicated resources for personnel, collaboration, and computation that are not available through standard single-investigator grants. NCEMS support is therefore essential to catalyze this multidisciplinary team and provide the necessary infrastructure for a project of this magnitude and ambition.

**Budget Justification:**
The budget is requested for a three-year period and is designed to support the personnel and activities central to the project's success.

**1. Personnel ($390,000):** The intellectual core of the project will be driven by dedicated trainees working collaboratively across the participating labs.
*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2 positions, 3 years):** $270,000. We request support for two postdoctoral fellows who will be the main drivers of the analytical work. Postdoc 1 will specialize in phylogenomics and ancestral sequence reconstruction. Postdoc 2 will focus on structural bioinformatics and network inference. They will be co-mentored and will spend time at different partner institutions to facilitate knowledge transfer.
*   **Graduate Students (2 students, 50% support, 3 years):** $120,000. We request partial stipend and tuition support for two graduate students. They will work on specific sub-projects, such as the detailed evolutionary history of the endomembrane system or the cytoskeleton, providing them with unparalleled cross-disciplinary training.

**2. Travel ($45,000):** Collaboration is key to this synthesis project.
*   **Annual Working Group Meetings (3 meetings):** $30,000. To facilitate intensive collaboration, data integration, and strategic planning, we will hold one 3-day in-person meeting each year for all PIs and trainees. Funds will cover travel and lodging.

**3. Computational Resources ($30,000):**
*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** $25,000. The phylogenomic analyses, particularly gene tree-species tree reconciliation for tens of thousands of gene families and the structural modeling of thousands of ancestral proteins, are computationally intensive. These funds will purchase compute cycles on a national supercomputing resource (e.g., via XSEDE) or a commercial cloud platform (e.g., AWS).
*   **Data Storage and Archiving:** $5,000. For robust, long-term storage of the multi-terabyte dataset and ensuring its public availability after the project concludes.

**4. Publication Costs ($15,000):**
*   **Open Access Fees:** To adhere to our open science commitment, we request funds to cover article processing charges for an anticipated 4-5 high-impact, open-access publications.

**5. Indirect Costs (F&A):** To be calculated based on the negotiated rates of the lead institution.

**Total Direct Costs: $480,000**

**Existing Resources:** The PIs will contribute significant existing resources, including faculty time, access to local university HPC clusters for preliminary analyses, software licenses, and laboratory/office space for personnel. The project's primary cost is not in data generation but in the personnel time and computational power required for its synthesis and integration, making it an extremely cost-effective approach to answering a fundamental scientific question. The NCEMS framework, with its emphasis on supporting collaborative working groups, is the ideal mechanism to enable this research.",,
ai_single_scientist_gemini_07,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,Cracking the Cis-Regulatory Code: A Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Spatiotemporal Gene Expression from DNA Sequence,"The precise orchestration of gene expression in space and time is the emergent outcome of a complex cis-regulatory code written in our DNA. This code, composed of enhancers, promoters, and insulators, is interpreted by transcription factors to control development and cellular function. Despite decades of research, predicting gene expression patterns from DNA sequence alone remains a grand challenge. This Working Group will tackle this challenge by building a unified deep learning framework that synthesizes the wealth of public functional genomics data. We will leverage massive datasets from consortia like ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and the 4D Nucleome, including data on chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq), transcription factor binding (ChIP-seq), histone modifications, and 3D chromatin contacts (Hi-C). This will be integrated with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data from atlases like the Human Cell Atlas to provide the ground truth for gene expression. Our team, comprising experts in computational genomics, machine learning, developmental biology, and statistics, will develop novel convolutional and graph-based neural network architectures that can model not only the linear sequence but also the 3D context of the genome. The resulting model will predict cell-type-specific gene expression levels directly from the DNA sequence of a given locus. This 'virtual geneticist' will empower researchers to predict the functional consequences of non-coding variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and to understand the regulatory logic that underpins complex biological processes and disease.",,"Background And Significance

The regulation of gene expression is the fundamental process by which a single genome gives rise to a multiplicity of cell types, tissues, and developmental programs. This emergent complexity is governed by the cis-regulatory code, a vast instruction set embedded within the non-coding portion of the genome. This code, comprising elements such as promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, dictates the precise spatiotemporal expression pattern of every gene. While the genetic code for protein synthesis was deciphered decades ago, a comprehensive, predictive understanding of the cis-regulatory code remains one of biology's grand challenges. Understanding this code is not merely an academic pursuit; over 90% of disease-associated genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in non-coding regions, presumably exerting their effects by altering gene regulation. Deciphering the code is therefore paramount to translating genetic discoveries into mechanistic insights and therapeutic strategies. 

Early efforts to model cis-regulation focused on identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) using position weight matrices (PWMs). While foundational, these models suffer from low specificity and fail to capture the combinatorial and syntactic rules—the 'grammar'—that govern regulatory element function. The advent of high-throughput functional genomics, spearheaded by consortia like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project, provided a breakthrough. These projects mapped chromatin states across hundreds of cell types, revealing that specific combinations of histone modifications and chromatin accessibility are highly predictive of regulatory element activity. Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models (e.g., ChromHMM), successfully leveraged these epigenetic features to annotate the non-coding genome. However, these models are correlational; they describe the regulatory landscape but cannot predict it from the underlying DNA sequence. They require experimental data as input, limiting their predictive power for new cell types or the effects of genetic variation.

The last decade has witnessed a paradigm shift with the application of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to regulatory genomics. Models like DeepSEA and Basset demonstrated the ability to predict epigenetic features, such as TF binding and chromatin accessibility, directly from DNA sequence with remarkable accuracy. More recent, sophisticated architectures like Basenji and the state-of-the-art Enformer model have extended this capability to predict gene expression, albeit indirectly, by correlating it with predicted epigenetic signals around the gene. These models represent a significant leap forward, learning complex sequence motifs and their local arrangements from raw DNA. 

Despite this progress, critical gaps persist. First, current models primarily capture local sequence context, typically within a few hundred kilobases. They struggle to explicitly and effectively model long-range interactions between distal enhancers and their target promoters, which can span over a megabase and are fundamental to the regulation of many key developmental genes. These interactions are mediated by the three-dimensional folding of chromatin, a feature largely ignored by existing sequence-to-expression models. Second, most models are trained on bulk tissue data, which averages signals from heterogeneous cell populations, obscuring the cell-type-specific nuances of gene regulation. The explosion of single-cell transcriptomic data from initiatives like the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) offers an unprecedented opportunity to train models with cellular resolution, but this has not yet been fully realized. Finally, the ultimate goal is not just to predict an expression value, but to create a model that is interpretable, allowing us to extract the biological principles of regulatory control. This project is timely and significant because it stands at the confluence of three transformative developments: the maturation of massive public data resources (ENCODE, 4D Nucleome, HCA), the development of more powerful and flexible deep learning architectures (e.g., graph neural networks), and the urgent need to functionally interpret non-coding genetic variation. By synthesizing these disparate data types within a novel framework, this Working Group is uniquely positioned to finally crack the cis-regulatory code.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This Working Group aims to address the grand challenge of predicting cell-type-specific gene expression directly from DNA sequence. Our central goal is to develop, train, and validate a unified deep learning framework that learns the cis-regulatory code by integrating 1D sequence, 3D chromatin architecture, and cell-type-specific transcriptomic data. This endeavor is guided by a set of specific, interconnected research questions and testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: How can 3D chromatin architecture be effectively integrated into a sequence-based deep learning model to improve the prediction of gene expression?**
Current models, based on convolutional networks, implicitly learn some distance effects but lack an explicit mechanism to model physical, long-range enhancer-promoter contacts. We posit that directly incorporating this information will be critical for accurately predicting the function of distal regulatory elements.
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** A hybrid graph-convolutional neural network (G-CNN) that uses 3D contact data (from Hi-C) to define the graph structure will significantly outperform purely 1D convolutional models in predicting gene expression, particularly for genes regulated by enhancers located more than 100kb from the transcription start site (TSS).
*   **Validation:** We will conduct a rigorous head-to-head comparison between our G-CNN model and a state-of-the-art baseline (e.g., Enformer) trained on the exact same data. Performance will be assessed on held-out chromosomes using Pearson correlation and Mean Squared Error between predicted and observed expression. We will specifically stratify the analysis by enhancer-TSS distance to test the hypothesis about long-range regulation.

**Research Question 2: Can a model trained on a diverse atlas of cell types learn a generalizable regulatory code that allows for accurate expression prediction in unseen cellular contexts?**
A truly useful model should not just memorize patterns in the training data but learn fundamental principles of gene regulation that can be generalized. This is crucial for studying rare cell types or developmental states for which comprehensive functional genomics data may not be available.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** Our model, trained on a large compendium of cell types from ENCODE, Roadmap, and the Human Cell Atlas, will achieve high predictive accuracy for gene expression in held-out cell types (zero-shot learning). Furthermore, its performance will be substantially improved by fine-tuning with a minimal amount of data from the target cell type (few-shot learning).
*   **Validation:** We will design a cross-validation scheme where entire cell types are held out from the training set. We will first evaluate the model's zero-shot performance on these cell types. Then, we will fine-tune the model using only the CAGE-seq data from the held-out cell type and measure the improvement in accuracy, demonstrating its ability to rapidly adapt to new contexts.

**Research Question 3: Can the model serve as a high-throughput 'virtual geneticist' to accurately predict the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variants on gene expression?**
The ultimate utility of a regulatory model lies in its ability to predict the effect of perturbations, namely genetic variants. This would provide a powerful tool for prioritizing functional variants from the millions identified in GWAS.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** In silico saturation mutagenesis using our trained model will accurately predict the direction and relative magnitude of expression changes caused by non-coding variants, showing strong correlation with experimental readouts from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and significant enrichment for known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).
*   **Validation:** We will use the model to score the predicted effect of all variants tested in published, large-scale MPRA datasets. We will compare the predicted variant effect scores with the experimentally measured effects. Additionally, we will apply our model to fine-map GWAS loci, and test whether the variants with the highest predicted functional scores are enriched for eQTLs from the GTEx project.

**Research Question 4: What novel biological principles of cis-regulatory grammar can be extracted by interpreting the trained model?**
A deep learning model is not just a predictor; it is a repository of learned patterns. By systematically dissecting the model, we can uncover the rules of gene regulation it has discovered.
*   **Hypothesis 4 (H4):** Model interpretation techniques (e.g., SHAP, Integrated Gradients) will identify not only known TF binding motifs but also novel, cell-type-specific motif combinations, syntactic rules (spacing and orientation), and higher-order sequence features that determine enhancer-promoter specificity and activity.
*   **Validation:** We will apply feature attribution methods to identify nucleotides critical for expression predictions. We will analyze these sequences for enrichment of known motifs and perform de novo motif discovery to find novel patterns. We will then computationally test the discovered syntactic rules by creating synthetic sequences and observing the model's predicted expression changes, generating testable hypotheses for future experimental work.

Methods And Approach

Our approach is a multi-year, milestone-driven plan to synthesize a vast collection of public data into a predictive, sequence-based model of gene regulation. The project is organized into four major phases: (1) Data Curation and Harmonization, (2) Model Development and Training, (3) Model Validation and Benchmarking, and (4) Model Interpretation and Application.

**Phase 1: Data Curation, Harmonization, and Integration (Year 1, Milestone 1)**
This foundational phase requires the expertise of our computational genomics team members. We will aggregate and process data from multiple large-scale public consortia.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **DNA Sequence:** Human reference genome (GRCh38).
    *   **Gene Expression (Training Targets):** We will use Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE-seq) data from the FANTOM5 consortium and ENCODE as our primary measure of transcription initiation at TSSs. For cell-type-specific expression, we will process uniformly collected single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and other cell atlas projects. Raw scRNA-seq data will be clustered to identify cell types, and expression profiles will be aggregated to create high-quality pseudo-bulk profiles for hundreds of distinct cell types.
    *   **3D Chromatin Architecture (Graph Structure):** High-resolution in situ Hi-C and Micro-C datasets from the 4D Nucleome (4DN) consortium and other key publications (e.g., Rao et al., 2014; Krietenstein et al., 2020) will be collected for a diverse panel of cell lines. Contact matrices will be normalized using standard methods (e.g., KR normalization) to mitigate experimental biases.
    *   **Epigenomic Data (Auxiliary Training Targets):** To aid model training through multi-task learning, we will process a wide array of epigenomic data from ENCODE and Roadmap, including chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq) and key histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3).
*   **Processing Pipeline:** We will build a reproducible Snakemake pipeline to download, align, and process all datasets. All genomic coordinates will be standardized to the GRCh38 assembly. Continuous data tracks (e.g., CAGE-seq, ATAC-seq) will be binned into 128-base-pair (bp) resolution intervals across the genome, creating the target vectors for our model.

**Phase 2: Hybrid Graph-Convolutional Model Development and Training (Years 1-2, Milestone 2)**
This phase, led by our machine learning experts, focuses on building and training our novel architecture.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will implement a hybrid model in PyTorch. 
    1.  **Sequence Encoder:** A deep convolutional neural network (CNN), inspired by the Enformer architecture, will serve as the backbone. It will take a long DNA sequence (e.g., 400kb) as input and use dilated convolutions to learn a rich representation of sequence features for each 128bp bin within the input window.
    2.  **Graph Representation:** For each input window, we will construct a graph where nodes correspond to larger genomic bins (e.g., 5kb). The initial feature vector for each node will be derived from the output of the CNN for the corresponding region. Edges between nodes will be weighted by the normalized Hi-C contact frequency.
    3.  **Interaction Modeler:** A Graph Attention Network (GAT) will operate on this graph. The GAT will learn to selectively propagate information between nodes (genomic regions) based on both their sequence features and their 3D proximity. This allows the model to explicitly learn how distal enhancers influence promoter regions.
    4.  **Prediction Head:** The final, updated representation of the node corresponding to the gene's TSS will be fed into a dense neural network to predict the CAGE-seq expression level for that gene across all cell types in a multi-task learning framework.
*   **Training:** The model will be trained on ~80% of the available cell types and all autosomes except for a held-out validation set (chr8, chr9) and test set (chr10, chr11). We will use the Adam optimizer and a combined loss function (e.g., Poisson Negative Log-Likelihood for count data). Training will be performed on a distributed GPU cluster, leveraging NCEMS-provided resources.

**Phase 3: Rigorous Model Validation and Benchmarking (Year 2, Milestone 3)**
Led by our statistics expert, this phase will ensure the model's robustness and superiority.
*   **Performance Metrics:** We will evaluate model performance primarily by the Pearson correlation between predicted and observed CAGE-seq values across genes for each cell type on the held-out test chromosomes.
*   **Baseline Comparison:** We will directly compare our model's performance against the current state-of-the-art, Enformer, by training it on our curated dataset. This will provide a fair and direct test of H1.
*   **Generalization Testing:** We will perform cross-cell-type validation to test H2, evaluating the model's ability to predict expression in cell types it has never seen during training.

**Phase 4: Interpretation, Variant Effect Prediction, and Dissemination (Year 3, Milestone 4)**
*   **Variant Scoring:** To test H3, we will implement an efficient in silico mutagenesis pipeline. For a given variant, we will predict expression using both the reference and alternative alleles and compute a functional score (e.g., log-fold change). We will validate these scores against MPRA and eQTL catalogs (GTEx, eQTLGen).
*   **Feature Attribution:** To test H4, we will use methods like Integrated Gradients to compute nucleotide-level importance scores for specific gene predictions. These attribution maps will be scanned for known and de novo motifs to uncover regulatory grammar.
*   **Timeline and Deliverables:**
    *   Y1: Finalized data processing pipeline; curated, analysis-ready dataset; implementation of baseline and prototype G-CNN models.
    *   Y2: Fully trained and optimized G-CNN model; comprehensive benchmarking results; manuscript draft describing the model.
    *   Y3: Complete variant effect prediction database; results from model interpretation; open-source software package and web portal; submission of all manuscripts.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will yield transformative outcomes and exert a profound impact across the molecular and cellular biosciences, directly aligning with the mission of the NCEMS. We anticipate contributions in three key areas: the creation of a powerful new community resource, the generation of fundamental biological knowledge, and the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

**1. A Paradigm-Shifting Community Resource: The 'Virtual Geneticist'**
The primary outcome of this Working Group will be a fully validated, open-source deep learning framework and a pre-trained model capable of predicting cell-type-specific gene expression from any human DNA sequence. This represents a significant leap beyond existing tools, which are often limited to predicting intermediate epigenetic marks or lack the ability to model the 3D genome. 
*   **Deliverables:** We will deliver (i) a user-friendly, open-source software package with extensive documentation, allowing any researcher to apply our model to their sequences of interest; (ii) a web portal with a simple interface for querying the model without requiring computational expertise; and (iii) a comprehensive, pre-computed database of predicted functional effects for all common variants in the human genome. 
*   **Impact on the Field:** This resource will democratize regulatory genomics. It will empower researchers to rapidly screen non-coding variants from GWAS, prioritizing candidates for experimental validation and dramatically accelerating the pace of discovery for the genetic basis of complex diseases. For developmental biologists, it will provide a tool to explore the regulatory consequences of genomic rearrangements or to design synthetic enhancers with bespoke expression patterns, opening new avenues in synthetic biology and gene therapy.

**2. Fundamental Insights into the Cis-Regulatory Code**
Beyond its predictive utility, our model will serve as an in silico laboratory for dissecting the principles of gene regulation. By developing and applying novel interpretation techniques, we will move beyond prediction to explanation.
*   **Expected Discoveries:** We expect to uncover the complex 'grammar' of the regulatory code. This includes identifying novel, cell-type-specific transcription factor motifs, deciphering the syntactic rules of motif spacing and orientation that confer regulatory function, and understanding how the 3D context of a gene modulates the activity of its enhancers. This addresses a long-standing puzzle in molecular biology: how a finite set of transcription factors can generate an almost infinite variety of expression patterns. The emergent properties of gene regulation will be codified in the learned parameters of our model.
*   **Impact on Basic Science:** These findings will fundamentally advance our understanding of how cellular identity is encoded in the genome and maintained through development. This knowledge will provide a new conceptual framework for studying evolution, development, and disease, generating countless new, testable hypotheses for the broader experimental community.

**3. Broader Impacts: Training, Collaboration, and Open Science**
This project is intrinsically aligned with the NCEMS goals of fostering collaboration, training, and open science.
*   **Training:** The project provides an ideal cross-disciplinary training environment. Postdocs and graduate students will be co-mentored by experts in machine learning, genomics, and statistics, acquiring a rare and highly valuable skillset at the intersection of these fields. They will emerge as leaders in the data-driven future of biology, fulfilling the call's mandate to train the next-generation data-savvy workforce.
*   **Collaboration and Dissemination:** The Working Group structure is essential for this project, as no single lab possesses the full range of expertise required. Our collaborative model, with regular in-person and virtual meetings, will create a synergistic environment that transcends institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We are deeply committed to open science principles. All code, data, and models will be made immediately available to the community via platforms like GitHub and Zenodo. We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ISMB, ASHG, NIPS), and workshops designed to train other researchers in the use of our tools. This project will not only produce a valuable resource but will also serve as a model for successful, open, and collaborative team science, nucleating future collaborations among the participants and the wider community.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory. Its success hinges on the integration of diverse expertise, access to significant computational resources, and dedicated personnel time, for which support from NCEMS is essential. The project's scope—aggregating petabyte-scale data, developing novel deep learning architectures, and performing computationally intensive training and validation—requires a collaborative, well-funded structure that existing grants or institutional resources cannot provide. The NCEMS framework is uniquely suited to support this transdisciplinary Working Group, enabling the sustained focus and synergy needed to achieve our ambitious goals.

ai_single_scientist_gemini_08,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,The Viral Battleground: Emergent Network Logic of Host-Pathogen Molecular Interactions,"Viral infection is a dynamic and complex process governed by a molecular arms race between the virus and its host. The ultimate outcome of this conflict—be it viral clearance, chronic infection, or host death—is an emergent property of a vast network of host-virus interactions. This Working Group will synthesize the entirety of publicly available host-virus interaction data to uncover the conserved network principles and evolutionary strategies that determine infection outcomes across diverse viruses. We will integrate physical protein-protein interaction data (from BioGRID, VirusMentha), genetic interaction screens, and structural data of host-virus complexes (PDB). This will be contextualized with transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from infected cells (GEO, PRIDE) for hundreds of different viruses. Our collaborative team of virologists, immunologists, systems biologists, and evolutionary bioinformaticians will construct and analyze comprehensive host-virus interaction networks. Using network topology analysis, machine learning, and comparative genomics, we will identify conserved host proteins and pathways that are commonly targeted by successful viruses ('pan-viral host dependencies') as well as the diverse strategies viruses have evolved to subvert them. The project aims to move beyond a one-virus-one-host view to a systems-level understanding of the fundamental rules of engagement. This will provide a powerful resource for identifying broad-spectrum antiviral targets and predicting the pathogenic potential of emerging viruses.",,"Background And Significance

Viral pathogens represent a persistent and profound threat to global health, a fact starkly underscored by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's molecular machinery for their replication, propagation, and survival. The process of infection is therefore an intricate molecular chess match, where the virus seeks to co-opt host factors while evading cellular defense mechanisms. The outcome of this conflict is an emergent phenomenon, arising from a complex, dynamic, and multi-layered network of interactions between viral and host molecules. For decades, the field of virology has largely operated under a reductionist paradigm, focusing on the detailed characterization of individual host-virus interactions for a single pathogen at a time. This 'one-virus, one-factor' approach has been undeniably successful, yielding critical insights into viral life cycles and leading to the development of effective antiviral drugs, such as those targeting the HIV protease or influenza neuraminidase. 

The advent of high-throughput technologies over the past two decades has revolutionized our ability to map these interactions on a global scale. Techniques like affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens have generated extensive protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps for numerous viruses, including influenza, dengue, Zika, and coronaviruses (Krogan et al., Nature, 2006; Shah et al., Cell, 2018). Concurrently, functional genomics approaches, particularly genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens, have systematically identified host genes that are either essential for (dependency factors) or restrictive to (restriction factors) viral infection (Carette et al., Science, 2009; Heaton et al., Nature, 2016). These monumental efforts have populated public databases such as BioGRID, IntAct, and VirusMentha with hundreds of thousands of individual host-virus interactions. Furthermore, repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and PRIDE now archive a wealth of transcriptomic and proteomic data, providing a dynamic view of the cellular response to infection across time for hundreds of different viruses. 

Despite this explosion of data, a major gap in our understanding persists. The data remain fragmented, siloed by virus, host system, or experimental modality. We lack a unified, systems-level framework to understand the common principles that govern these complex interactions across the vast diversity of the viral world. Current knowledge is akin to having detailed street maps of a few individual cities, while lacking a global atlas that reveals the interconnected highways, common infrastructure, and universal traffic laws. We do not yet have a clear picture of the 'pan-viral host dependencies'—the core set of cellular machinery that is consistently exploited by evolutionarily divergent viruses. We cannot articulate the network-level 'signatures' that distinguish a lytic infection from a latent one, or a highly pathogenic virus from a relatively benign one. Consequently, our ability to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that would be effective against entire viral families or future emerging threats remains limited. This project is both important and timely because for the first time, the sheer volume and diversity of publicly available data make it possible to move beyond single-virus studies and perform a community-scale synthesis. By integrating these disparate datasets, we can begin to decipher the conserved 'rules of engagement' in the host-virus arms race, addressing fundamental questions about molecular emergence and providing a critical resource for pandemic preparedness.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to synthesize the vast landscape of public host-virus interaction data to uncover the conserved network principles and emergent properties that dictate the outcomes of viral infection. We will move beyond the study of individual pathogens to build a systems-level, pan-viral understanding of pathogenesis. To achieve this, we have structured our research around three central, interconnected aims, each with specific questions and testable hypotheses.

**Aim 1: Construct a Pan-Viral Host-Pathogen Interactome and Identify Conserved Cellular Hubs of Viral Dependency.**
This aim addresses the foundational need for a unified map of the host-virus molecular battleground.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** What is the comprehensive, multi-layered network topology of interactions between human proteins and proteins from all viruses with available data?
*   **Research Question 1.2:** Are there specific host proteins, protein complexes, and cellular pathways that are disproportionately targeted by a wide range of evolutionarily diverse viruses, and do these 'pan-viral dependencies' share common network properties?
*   **Hypothesis 1:** We hypothesize that the pan-viral interactome is not randomly organized but is structured around a core set of highly connected and central host proteins (network hubs and bottlenecks). These proteins will be significantly enriched for fundamental cellular processes such as mRNA translation, protein trafficking (e.g., the nuclear pore complex), energy metabolism, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. We predict these nodes represent evolutionary 'choke points' that are difficult for the host to alter without incurring a significant fitness cost, making them stable targets for viral manipulation.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will test this by constructing the integrated network and employing graph-theoretic algorithms to calculate node centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector). We will use statistical enrichment analyses (e.g., hypergeometric tests with FDR correction) against GO and KEGG pathway annotations to identify over-represented functions. The significance of these hubs will be validated against rigorously defined null models, such as networks with shuffled edges but preserved degree distributions, to ensure our findings are not mere artifacts of network structure.

**Aim 2: Elucidate the Emergent Network Signatures that Determine Viral Pathogenesis and Infection Outcome.**
This aim seeks to connect network structure to biological function and clinical phenotype.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Do viruses with distinct clinical outcomes (e.g., acute vs. chronic, lytic vs. latent, high vs. low pathogenicity) exhibit quantifiable differences in their host-interaction network strategies?
*   **Research Question 2.2:** Can a machine learning model trained on these network features accurately predict the pathogenic potential or infection strategy of a virus based solely on its host interaction profile?
*   **Hypothesis 2:** We hypothesize that distinct viral lifestyles correspond to unique network 'signatures'. For instance, chronic viruses (e.g., HIV, HCV) will show enriched targeting of host pathways involved in adaptive and innate immune evasion and cell cycle regulation, while highly lytic viruses will preferentially target central metabolic and translational machinery to maximize virion production. We predict these signatures can be captured by a vector of quantitative features, including the centrality of targeted host proteins, the modularity of the interaction sub-network, and the profile of perturbed host pathways.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will curate a training set of viruses with well-annotated clinical phenotypes. For each, we will extract its network feature vector. We will then use comparative statistical analyses to identify features that significantly differ between classes. Subsequently, we will train supervised machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to distinguish between these classes. The model's predictive power will be rigorously assessed using k-fold cross-validation and on a held-out test set of viruses not used in training.

**Aim 3: Define the Convergent and Divergent Evolutionary Strategies Viruses Use to Manipulate Host Networks.**
This aim explores the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics at the host-virus interface.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** When evolutionarily distant viruses target the same host protein, do they converge on using structurally similar interfaces, or do they evolve diverse binding solutions to achieve the same functional outcome?
*   **Research Question 3.2:** Do pan-viral host dependency factors exhibit stronger signatures of positive selection (an evolutionary arms race) compared to other host proteins, and do these signatures spatially co-locate with viral binding interfaces?
*   **Hypothesis 3:** We hypothesize that both convergent and divergent evolution shape the host-virus interface. We predict we will find numerous instances of molecular mimicry, where unrelated viral proteins evolve similar structural motifs (e.g., short linear motifs) to bind a conserved pocket on a host hub protein. We also hypothesize that the host genes encoding pan-viral dependencies will show significantly elevated dN/dS ratios, indicative of recurrent positive selection, reflecting a long-standing evolutionary conflict with a multitude of pathogens.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate structural data from the PDB to perform 3D alignment of viral proteins that bind the same host target, identifying shared or distinct interaction surfaces. For evolutionary analysis, we will use phylogenetic methods (e.g., PAML, HyPhy) to calculate selection pressures on host genes, comparing the distribution of dN/dS ratios between pan-viral targets and a control set of non-targeted host genes. We will then map sites under positive selection onto protein structures to test for overlap with viral interaction interfaces.

Methods And Approach

This project is designed as a community-scale synthesis effort, leveraging the diverse expertise of our Working Group, which includes virologists, immunologists, systems biologists, evolutionary bioinformaticians, and data scientists. Our collaborative framework will be managed through bi-weekly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops hosted by NCEMS, and a shared computational infrastructure utilizing GitHub for version control, Slack for communication, and a common cloud computing environment. The project will be executed in three integrated phases.

**Phase 1: Data Aggregation, Curation, and Integration (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase focuses on building a comprehensive, high-quality knowledge base from disparate public sources.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically mine and integrate data from a curated list of public repositories. 
    1.  **Physical Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** Data will be sourced from major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, MINT, and VirusMentha. We will parse all available evidence for interactions between viral and human proteins, capturing experimental details such as the detection method (e.g., AP-MS, Y2H, Co-IP).
    2.  **Genetic Interactions:** We will compile results from published genome-wide functional screens (CRISPR, shRNA, siRNA) that identify host dependency and restriction factors. Data will be extracted from supplementary materials of key publications and repositories like GEO and BioProjects.
    3.  **Structural Interactions:** We will retrieve all experimentally determined 3D structures of human-virus protein complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
    4.  **Functional Genomics Context:** To understand the dynamic cellular response, we will aggregate infection-specific transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and proteomic (MS) datasets from GEO, ArrayExpress, and the PRIDE archive. This will allow us to contextualize static interactions with dynamic changes in gene and protein expression.
*   **Data Harmonization and Quality Control:** A major challenge is the heterogeneity of the data. We will develop a robust bioinformatic pipeline to map all proteins and genes to stable, standardized identifiers (UniProt, Ensembl, NCBI Gene). A crucial innovation will be the development of a consolidated evidence scoring system for each interaction, integrating factors such as the number of independent publications, the reliability of the experimental methods, and conservation across related viruses. This will allow us to weight edges in our network by confidence. All curated data will be structured and loaded into a Neo4j graph database, which is optimized for complex network queries and analysis.

**Phase 2: Network Construction, Analysis, and Predictive Modeling (Months 7-20)**
This phase focuses on analyzing the integrated data to address Aims 1 and 2.
*   **Pan-Viral Network Construction:** Using the graph database, we will construct a multi-layered network where nodes represent human and viral proteins and edges represent physical, genetic, or regulatory interactions, weighted by our confidence score. 
*   **Network Topology and Pathway Analysis (Aim 1):** We will use established network analysis libraries (NetworkX in Python, igraph in R) to perform a global characterization of the network. We will compute various centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector) to identify topologically important host proteins. We will apply community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain, Infomap) to uncover functional modules of densely interconnected proteins. To identify pan-viral dependencies, we will identify host nodes targeted by the highest number of distinct viral families and test these sets for functional enrichment in GO terms and KEGG pathways using tools like g:Profiler, correcting for multiple hypothesis testing.
*   **Machine Learning for Phenotype Prediction (Aim 2):** We will first curate a ground-truth dataset of viruses, annotating each with phenotypic labels (e.g., acute/chronic, enveloped/non-enveloped, DNA/RNA). For each virus, we will generate a high-dimensional feature vector from its sub-network of host interactions. Features will include: statistics of centrality scores of targeted host proteins, enrichment scores for targeted pathways, and graphlet frequency profiles. We will then employ a suite of supervised machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Support Vector Machines, to build classifiers that predict viral phenotypes from these network features. We will use a rigorous nested cross-validation approach for hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation to avoid overfitting. Model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP values) will be used to identify the specific network features that are most predictive of pathogenicity.

**Phase 3: Structural and Evolutionary Systems Analysis (Months 15-30)**
This phase will delve into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary pressures shaping the interactome, addressing Aim 3.
*   **Structural Convergence Analysis:** For high-confidence pan-viral host targets, we will systematically analyze all available PDB structures of their complexes with different viral proteins. Using structural alignment tools (e.g., TM-align, PyMOL), we will compare the binding interfaces to identify cases of convergent evolution, where unrelated viral proteins have evolved similar structural motifs to engage the same functional hotspot on the host protein.
*   **Phylogenetic Analysis of Evolutionary Conflict:** For the list of identified pan-viral dependencies, we will retrieve orthologous gene sequences from across the primate and mammalian lineages from Ensembl. We will build multiple sequence alignments and use codon-based models of evolution implemented in PAML and HyPhy to calculate dN/dS ratios and identify specific codons under positive selection. A key test of our hypothesis will be to determine if sites under positive selection are significantly more likely to reside at the structurally-defined virus-binding interfaces than at other surface-exposed sites, which would provide strong evidence of a molecular arms race.

**Open Science and Training:** This project is fundamentally collaborative and open. All analysis scripts and workflows will be developed in version-controlled GitHub repositories and documented using Jupyter Notebooks. All curated data and results, including the final network, will be made publicly available through the Zenodo repository and a user-friendly, interactive web portal. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be central to the project, leading specific analyses, participating in cross-lab data-thons, and receiving unique interdisciplinary training at the intersection of virology and computational biology.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will generate transformative outcomes, providing profound new insights into the fundamental principles of host-pathogen interactions and creating invaluable resources for the scientific community. The impact will span basic molecular science, translational medicine, and public health preparedness.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Foundational Pan-Viral Interactome Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the most comprehensive, integrated, and quality-controlled map of the human-virus molecular interactome ever created. This network, accessible via an interactive web portal, will serve as a foundational resource for the virology, immunology, and cell biology communities. It will empower researchers to move beyond single-pathogen studies, enabling them to place their findings in a broader context, generate new hypotheses, and design more targeted experiments. This resource will be a public good, analogous to the STRING database for protein-protein interactions or the KEGG database for pathways, but specifically tailored to the landscape of viral infection.
2.  **Discovery of Universal Principles of Pathogenesis:** By analyzing this global map, we will uncover the emergent, systems-level 'rules of engagement' in the host-virus conflict. We expect to identify a core set of 'pan-viral host dependencies'—the cellular Achilles' heels that are repeatedly exploited by diverse viruses. This will fundamentally shift our understanding of which cellular processes are most critical during infection, moving beyond virus-specific factors to a universal framework. 
3.  **A New Paradigm for Predicting Viral Threat:** Our development of a predictive model for viral pathogenicity based on network signatures represents a novel paradigm. If successful, this will provide a computational framework to rapidly assess the potential threat of newly discovered or emerging viruses based on initial interaction mapping data. This moves beyond simple genomic sequence analysis to a more functional, systems-based prediction of pathogenic potential.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Accelerating Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Therapy:** The most significant translational impact will be the identification and prioritization of a list of high-confidence host proteins that serve as pan-viral dependencies. These proteins represent prime targets for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Therapeutics targeting host factors are thought to be less susceptible to the evolution of viral resistance and could be effective against entire families of viruses (e.g., all coronaviruses) or even unrelated viruses that depend on the same host pathway. This work will provide a data-driven roadmap for pharmaceutical and academic drug discovery programs, directly contributing to pandemic preparedness.
2.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This project is intrinsically interdisciplinary and will provide a unique training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in data science, network biology, machine learning, and evolutionary genomics, applied to pressing problems in infectious disease. This directly addresses the research call's goal of training a future workforce capable of tackling complex, data-intensive biological questions.
3.  **Commitment to Open and Reproducible Science:** By making all our data, code, and analysis workflows publicly available, we will promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. The resources we create will lower the barrier to entry for other researchers to perform similar large-scale data synthesis projects, fostering a culture of open science within the molecular biosciences community.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Sustainability:**
Our findings will be disseminated through multiple channels. We anticipate 3-4 high-impact publications in journals such as *Cell*, *Nature*, or *Science* for the main synthesis findings, and more focused papers in top-tier specialty journals like *Cell Host & Microbe* or *PLoS Pathogens*. We will present our work at major international conferences (e.g., American Society for Virology, ISMB). The interactive web portal will be our primary vehicle for sharing the data with the community. Beyond the funding period, the established collaborative network and the data integration framework are designed for sustainability. The portal will be maintained, and the database will be periodically updated with new public data. This Working Group will be ideally positioned to seek larger-scale, long-term funding (e.g., an NIH Center grant) to expand this 'Human Vireome' project, solidifying the foundation laid by this NCEMS-supported initiative.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale, community-level synthesis effort that is beyond the scope and resources of any single research laboratory. The project's success hinges on the integration of diverse datasets and, critically, the synergistic collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of experts. This inherent need for a collaborative, resource-intensive approach makes the NCEMS Working Group mechanism the ideal and necessary vehicle for this work. Standard single-investigator grants cannot support the dedicated personnel, computational infrastructure, and intensive coordination required to aggregate, harmonize, and analyze terabytes of heterogeneous data from hundreds of sources.

**Budget Justification:**
The total requested budget for the 30-month project period is $495,000. The funds are allocated across key categories essential for the project's execution.

    *   **Two Postdoctoral Fellows (2.5 years each):** These fellows will be the intellectual drivers of the project. One will have expertise in network biology and machine learning, leading the efforts in Aims 1 and 2. The second will be an evolutionary bioinformatician focused on the structural and phylogenetic analyses in Aim 3. Their dedicated effort is paramount. (2.5 years x 2 fellows x $60,000/year salary + 30% fringe = $390,000). *Correction: Let's adjust to fit the total. (2.5 years x 2 fellows x $55,000/year salary + 30% fringe = $357,500)*. Let's round to $360k for simplicity in the text.
    *   **Partial support for one Data Manager/Software Engineer (0.4 FTE for 2.5 years):** This role is crucial for building and maintaining the data integration pipeline and developing the public-facing web portal. This requires specialized software engineering skills not typically found in a biology postdoc. (0.4 FTE x 2.5 years x $80,000/year salary + 30% fringe = $104,000). *This is too high. Let's re-allocate.* 
    *   **Revised Personnel ($360,000):**
        *   **Two Postdoctoral Fellows (2.5 years):** As described above. ($357,500)
        *   **Graduate Student Support:** Stipend supplement for two graduate students to contribute to data curation and specific analysis modules, providing a key training opportunity. ($2,500)

*   **Travel ($45,000):** Collaboration is key. This budget supports:
    *   Two annual in-person Working Group meetings for the PIs and trainees. These meetings are indispensable for deep integration, strategic planning, and problem-solving. (2 meetings x 8 people x $1,500/person = $24,000).
    *   Travel for the two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students to present their findings at one major international conference each during the project period, facilitating dissemination and networking. (4 trainees x $2,000/conference = $8,000). *Let's adjust numbers to make sense.* (2 meetings x 8 people x $2000/person = $32,000). (4 trainees x $3,250 for 1 conference each = $13,000). Total = $45,000.

*   **Computational Resources ($40,000):**

    *   Funds for long-term data hosting and archiving on platforms like Zenodo and for maintaining the web portal domain and server for 5 years. ($10,000).

*   **Publication Costs ($15,000):**
    *   To ensure adherence to Open Science principles, we budget for open-access publication fees for an anticipated 3-4 major manuscripts in high-impact journals.

*   **Indirect Costs (F&A):** Calculated based on the collaborating institutions' federally negotiated rates on the modified total direct costs.

**Existing Resources:** The participating institutions will provide significant in-kind support, including faculty salaries, administrative support, office and laboratory space, and access to institutional high-performance computing clusters, which will supplement the requested cloud resources. This demonstrates strong institutional commitment and leverages existing infrastructure.",,
ai_single_scientist_gemini_09,ai,single_scientist,gemini-2.5-pro,The Synaptic Engram: A Multi-Scale Synthesis of the Molecular Machinery of Memory,"Learning and memory are emergent properties of the brain, rooted in the plasticity of synapses. The molecular basis of this plasticity, the 'engram,' involves the dynamic reorganization of thousands of proteins within a space less than a micron wide. Understanding how these molecular changes give rise to stable memory traces requires integrating information across vast spatial and temporal scales. This Working Group will build the first comprehensive, multi-scale computational model of a mammalian synapse by synthesizing a diverse array of public data. We will integrate atomic-resolution structures of synaptic proteins (PDB, EMDB), comprehensive synaptic proteome inventories (SynGO), cryo-electron tomography data of synaptic ultrastructure, super-resolution microscopy data of protein localization, and functional data from electrophysiology recordings (Allen Brain Atlas, NeuroMorpho.org). Our team, a partnership between neuroscientists, structural biologists, computational biophysicists, and systems modelers, will develop a novel framework to bridge these scales. We will use agent-based modeling and reaction-diffusion simulations, constrained by the structural and proteomic data, to simulate the molecular choreography during synaptic potentiation and depression. This 'virtual synapse' will allow us to test how mutations linked to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders disrupt synaptic function, providing a mechanistic link from gene to cognitive deficit. This project will create an unparalleled resource for neuroscience, enabling in silico experiments that are currently impossible at the wet bench.",,"Background And Significance

The ability to learn and form memories is arguably the most profound emergent property of the brain, enabling adaptation, survival, and consciousness. The cellular foundation of this phenomenon was famously postulated by Donald Hebb and later demonstrated by Bliss and Lømo's discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP), a persistent strengthening of synapses following high-frequency stimulation. It is now a central tenet of neuroscience that activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength, including both LTP and long-term depression (LTD), constitute the physical basis of memory storage. The enduring molecular and structural changes that encode a memory are collectively known as the 'engram.' While the concept is over a century old, identifying the precise composition and dynamics of the synaptic engram remains one of the most significant challenges in molecular and cellular biology.

The challenge is one of scale. A single excitatory synapse in the mammalian hippocampus is a marvel of molecular engineering, comprising over 1,500 distinct protein species packed into the postsynaptic density (PSD), a sub-micron domain. These proteins form a dense, dynamic network of receptors, ion channels, signaling enzymes, and scaffolds that collectively regulate synaptic transmission. Understanding how this complex machinery gives rise to stable memory requires integrating knowledge across disparate biological scales: from the atomic resolution of individual protein interactions (angstroms), to the spatial organization of protein complexes (nanometers), to the overall synaptic ultrastructure (microns), and finally to the functional output measured by electrophysiology (milliseconds to hours). 

Over the past two decades, a deluge of publicly available data has provided unprecedented, albeit fragmented, views into the synapse. Structural biology, through X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, has deposited thousands of atomic-resolution structures of key synaptic proteins like NMDA and AMPA receptors into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). Concurrently, mass spectrometry-based proteomics has generated comprehensive parts lists of the synapse, with resources like SynGO providing a consensus inventory and functional annotation of synaptic proteins. At a higher level, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offers breathtaking, near-native snapshots of synaptic ultrastructure, revealing the spatial arrangement of vesicles, membranes, and cytoskeletal elements. Super-resolution microscopy techniques like STORM and PALM have begun to map the nanoscale distribution of specific proteins within the PSD. Finally, large-scale initiatives like the Allen Brain Atlas provide vast repositories of electrophysiological recordings that characterize the functional properties of different neuron and synapse types. 

The critical gap in our knowledge is not a lack of data, but a lack of integration. These powerful datasets exist in silos, each describing the synapse from a single perspective. We have a list of parts, but no dynamic blueprint for how they are assembled. We have static images, but little understanding of the molecular choreography that drives plasticity. Current computational models are often limited to a single scale, such as molecular dynamics simulations of a single receptor, or are highly abstract, like connectionist models that treat synapses as simple scalar weights. There is no existing framework that can bridge the scales from atomic interactions to emergent synaptic function. This fundamental limitation prevents us from answering key questions: How do hundreds of proteins work in concert to stably trap AMPA receptors during LTP? How do disease-associated mutations in a single synaptic protein disrupt the function of the entire system? This project is timely and essential because the requisite data and computational power are finally available to tackle this grand challenge. By synthesizing these public datasets into a unified, multi-scale model, we can move beyond descriptive biology and build a predictive, mechanistic model of the synaptic engram, addressing a long-standing puzzle in neuroscience and providing a powerful new tool to investigate synaptic dysfunction in disease.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to construct and validate the first data-driven, multi-scale computational model of a mammalian glutamatergic synapse. This 'virtual synapse' will serve as a computational framework to investigate the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and dysfunction. By integrating structural, proteomic, imaging, and functional data, we will simulate the dynamic molecular events that underlie learning and memory at the single-synapse level. Our research is guided by four central questions, each leading to specific, testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: How do the copy number, spatial organization, and interaction networks of key synaptic proteins define the basal, resting state of a synapse and its capacity for plasticity?**
Before a synapse can change, it must have a stable baseline. The precise stoichiometry and arrangement of proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD) are thought to determine its functional properties, such as the number of available AMPA receptors and the proximity of signaling molecules. We hypothesize that the basal state is not static but a dynamic steady-state maintained by a balance of protein turnover and transient interactions.
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** The structural integrity and basal transmission properties of the synapse are emergent properties of the dense, multivalent interactions between scaffold proteins (e.g., PSD-95, Homer, SHANK) and their binding partners. The model will predict that the diffusion of key receptors like AMPARs is constrained within microdomains defined by this scaffold network. Validation will involve comparing simulated fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) curves for AMPARs against published experimental data.

**Research Question 2: What is the precise spatio-temporal choreography of protein recruitment, modification, and trafficking that underlies the induction and stabilization of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)?**
LTP induction triggers a massive influx of calcium, initiating a complex signaling cascade. While key players like CaMKII and AMPA receptor insertion are known, their coordinated dynamics within the crowded synaptic environment are poorly understood. 
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** The initial phase of LTP stabilization is a cooperative process where CaMKII activation leads to both the phosphorylation of AMPARs (increasing their channel conductance) and the phosphorylation of scaffold proteins, creating new binding sites that trap newly exocytosed AMPARs in the PSD. Our model will predict a specific time course for these events and demonstrate that blocking either pathway (e.g., by simulating a kinase-dead CaMKII) will prevent stable potentiation. The expected outcome is a quantitative, dynamic map of the molecular cascade leading to a potentiated state.

**Research Question 3: What are the distinct molecular cascades that mediate Long-Term Depression (LTD), and how do they functionally oppose LTP at the systems level?**
LTD, a weakening of synaptic strength, is also calcium-dependent but is triggered by different stimulation patterns. It is thought to involve the activation of protein phosphatases and the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. We aim to model this process with the same level of detail as LTP to understand the bidirectional control of synaptic strength.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** The switch between LTP and LTD is determined by the amplitude and dynamics of the postsynaptic calcium signal. A low, prolonged calcium signal, as occurs during LTD induction, will preferentially activate calcineurin in our model, leading to the dephosphorylation of key substrates like GluA1 and the subsequent unbinding and endocytosis of AMPARs. The model will predict a net loss of surface AMPARs and a reduction in simulated synaptic current, consistent with experimental LTD. We will test this by systematically varying the parameters of the simulated calcium influx.

**Research Question 4: How do specific genetic mutations linked to neuropsychiatric disorders alter the molecular dynamics of plasticity and lead to predictable functional deficits?**
A key application of our model is to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype for brain disorders. Many mutations associated with autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability occur in synaptic proteins.
*   **Hypothesis 4 (H4):** A haploinsufficiency of SHANK3, a major cause of Phelan-McDermid syndrome and autism, disrupts the structural integrity of the PSD scaffold, leading to an unstable synaptic state and impaired LTP. We will simulate this by reducing the copy number of SHANK3 agents by 50%. The model is predicted to show an inability to sustain potentiation following an LTP stimulus, as AMPARs fail to be stably trapped. This in silico result will provide a mechanistic explanation for the cognitive deficits observed in patients and mouse models, demonstrating the model's power as a 'disease-in-a-dish' platform.

Methods And Approach

This project is founded on the synthesis of heterogeneous public data into a cohesive, predictive model. Our approach is organized into three synergistic phases, executed by a transdisciplinary team of neuroscientists, structural biologists, computational biophysicists, and data scientists. The project's collaborative nature and reliance on large-scale data integration demonstrate a clear need for NCEMS support.

**Phase 1: Data Curation, Harmonization, and Integration (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase involves aggregating and standardizing data from multiple public repositories to build a unified knowledge base for a canonical hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron synapse.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Protein Composition & Stoichiometry:** We will use SynGO and SynDB as primary sources for a consensus list of synaptic proteins. Quantitative proteomics data from the literature will be mined to estimate the average copy number of key proteins per synapse.
    *   **Atomic Structures:** High-resolution structures of proteins and complexes (e.g., NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, CaMKII, PSD-95) will be sourced from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB).
    *   **Synaptic Ultrastructure:** We will leverage publicly available cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) datasets from repositories like the EMPIAR to generate a realistic 3D mesh of the presynaptic terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic density, defining the simulation volume and organelle placement.
    *   **Protein Localization:** Super-resolution microscopy data (STORM/PALM) from publications and repositories, along with data from the Human Protein Atlas, will be used to generate 3D probability maps for the spatial distribution of key proteins within the synaptic compartments.
    *   **Reaction Kinetics & Functional Parameters:** Databases like SABIO-RK and Brenda will be mined for kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions (e.g., phosphorylation, dephosphorylation). Electrophysiological data from the Allen Brain Atlas and NeuroMorpho.org will provide constraints for model validation, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes and decay kinetics.
*   **Integration Framework:** We will develop a graph database schema to link these disparate data types. Each protein will be a node with attributes including its UniProt ID, copy number, links to its PDB structures, its spatial probability map, and its known interactions and reaction kinetics. This creates a queryable, multi-scale representation of synaptic knowledge.

**Phase 2: Multi-Scale Model Construction and Simulation (Months 10-24)**
Using the integrated knowledge base, we will construct and simulate the 'virtual synapse' using a hybrid agent-based and reaction-diffusion modeling approach.
*   **Modeling Platform:** We will primarily use the MCell/CellBlender software suite, which is optimized for particle-based simulation of cellular microphysiology. This allows us to model individual protein molecules as 'agents' in a realistic 3D environment.
*   **Model Construction:** The 3D mesh from cryo-ET data will form the simulation environment. This volume will be populated with agents representing individual proteins, placed according to their copy numbers and spatial probability maps. Each agent will have defined properties: a 3D structure (for steric interactions), a diffusion coefficient, and specific reaction sites. Interaction rules (e.g., binding/unbinding rates, catalytic rates) will be parameterized using the curated kinetic data.
*   **Simulation Protocol:**
    1.  **Basal State:** The model will first be run without a stimulus to achieve a dynamic steady state. This baseline model will be validated by comparing simulated protein turnover and receptor mobility (e.g., simulated FRAP) with experimental data.
    2.  **Plasticity Induction:** LTP and LTD will be induced by simulating realistic calcium influx profiles through NMDA receptor agents, with parameters derived from electrophysiology data. This calcium signal will trigger the downstream reaction networks defined in our model.
    3.  **Data Analysis:** We will track key output variables over the course of the simulation, including the number and location of surface AMPA receptors, the phosphorylation state of critical proteins (CaMKII, AMPAR subunits), and the size and density of protein clusters in the PSD. These outputs provide a direct test of our hypotheses.

**Phase 3: In Silico Experiments and Hypothesis Testing (Months 25-36)**
With a validated model, we will perform systematic virtual experiments.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** We will directly test hypotheses H1-H4 by manipulating the model. For H2, we will simulate LTP with and without CaMKII activity. For H4, we will reduce the SHANK3 agent copy number by 50% and compare the LTP simulation to the wild-type model.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** We will perform a global sensitivity analysis to determine which model parameters (e.g., a specific binding affinity, a protein's concentration) have the greatest influence on functional outputs like the magnitude of potentiation. This will identify critical molecular control points and generate novel predictions for wet-lab validation.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of the integrated synaptic knowledge base (M9); Assembly of a static, structurally complete model of the synapse (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Validation of the dynamic basal state model (M18); First successful simulations of LTP and LTD induction (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Completion of systematic in silico experiments for H1-H4 (M30); Public release of the model, codebase, and a comprehensive user guide via a project web portal (M36).

**Open Science:** All curated data, models, simulation scripts, and analysis workflows will be version-controlled on a public GitHub repository and archived on Zenodo, ensuring full reproducibility and adherence to the highest standards of open science.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project will pioneer a new, synthesis-driven approach to one of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience: the molecular basis of memory. The expected outcomes will provide transformative contributions to the field, with broad impacts on basic science, translational research, and scientific training.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of the Synapse:** The primary outcome will be the first-of-its-kind, multi-scale computational model of a mammalian excitatory synapse. This 'virtual synapse' will be more than a static representation; it will be a dynamic, predictive engine capable of simulating complex biological processes. It will represent a paradigm shift from studying individual components in isolation to understanding the synapse as an integrated, emergent system. This model will be made publicly available as a community resource.
2.  **Mechanistic Insights into Synaptic Plasticity:** Our simulations will provide an unprecedented, four-dimensional view of the molecular choreography underlying LTP and LTD. We will generate dynamic maps of protein trafficking, post-translational modifications, and structural rearrangements that are currently impossible to capture experimentally. This will allow us to move beyond correlational studies and test causal relationships, for example, determining if a specific phosphorylation event is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of a memory trace.
3.  **A Framework for Understanding Synaptopathies:** The model will serve as a powerful 'in silico' platform for investigating how genetic mutations lead to synaptic dysfunction. By simulating the effects of disease-associated mutations (e.g., in SHANK3, GRIN2B, FMR1), we will provide a mechanistic bridge from a molecular defect to a predictable functional deficit (e.g., impaired LTP). This will generate novel hypotheses about the pathophysiology of disorders like autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Accelerating Neuroscience Research:** The virtual synapse will be a powerful hypothesis-generating tool. Researchers worldwide will be able to use our open-access platform to perform virtual experiments—testing the potential role of a newly discovered protein, predicting the effect of a drug, or exploring the consequences of a genetic variant—thus guiding and prioritizing costly and time-consuming wet-lab experiments.
*   **Catalyzing Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** This project, by its very nature, fosters collaboration between computational and experimental biologists. The model's predictions will spur new experimental work, while new experimental data can be used to refine and expand the model, creating a virtuous cycle of discovery. This aligns perfectly with the NCEMS mission to stimulate cross-disciplinary science.
*   **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows involved in this project will receive unique, transdisciplinary training at the intersection of neuroscience, computational biophysics, and data science. They will become fluent in data synthesis, computational modeling, and open science practices, creating the data-savvy workforce essential for 21st-century biology.
*   **Educational Resource:** The model and its visualizations will be a powerful educational tool for teaching the complexities of synaptic function to students at all levels, from undergraduate to graduate school.

**Dissemination Plan:**
Our dissemination strategy is designed for maximum impact and community engagement. We will publish our primary findings in high-impact journals such as *Cell*, *Neuron*, or *Nature Neuroscience*. Methodological advancements will be published in specialized journals like *PLoS Computational Biology*. We will present our work at major international conferences (e.g., Society for Neuroscience, FENS Forum, Biophysical Society). Crucially, all data, models, and code will be shared via a dedicated project web portal and public repositories (GitHub, Zenodo). We will host annual workshops and online tutorials to train the wider community in using our tools, ensuring the project's legacy and utility far beyond the funding period.

**Long-Term Vision:** This project lays the foundation for a comprehensive 'digital twin' of a neural circuit. In the long term, we envision expanding the model to include inhibitory synapses, glial interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. By connecting multiple virtual synapses, we can begin to simulate the emergent properties of microcircuits, providing a seamless link from molecules to cognition.

These emergent functions are critical for biogeochemical cycles and host health. However, the principles that govern how species interactions lead to stable, functional communities remain poorly understood. This Working Group will synthesize vast public metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic data to uncover the 'rules of life' for microbial consortia. We will leverage data from large-scale initiatives like the Human Microbiome Project and the Earth Microbiome Project, alongside thousands of curated genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from databases like KBase and BiGG. Our team, composed of microbial ecologists, systems biologists, bioinformaticians, and ecological modelers, will develop a novel computational pipeline. This pipeline will first reconstruct community composition and metabolic potential from metagenomes, then use metatranscriptomic data to constrain metabolic flux, and finally predict emergent metabolic outputs and cross-feeding interactions. By applying this framework across thousands of diverse microbial communities from different environments (e.g., gut, soil, ocean), we will identify conserved patterns of metabolic interdependence, competition, and niche partitioning. The goal is to derive a set of generalizable principles that can predict community stability and function from genomic data alone. This work will lay the foundation for the rational design of synthetic microbial consortia for applications in biotechnology, environmental remediation, and medicine.",,"Background And Significance

Microbial communities are the invisible engines of our planet, driving global biogeochemical cycles and fundamentally shaping the health of their hosts. The collective metabolic activity of these communities is a classic example of an emergent phenomenon, where the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts. A community can degrade complex substrates, detoxify environments, or produce essential metabolites that no single member could manage alone. This functional emergence arises from a complex web of metabolic interactions, including competition for resources, syntrophic cross-feeding of intermediates, and the partitioning of metabolic pathways across different species. Understanding the principles that govern these interactions is one of the grand challenges in modern biology. A predictive understanding would unlock the potential to engineer microbial communities for applications in personalized medicine, sustainable agriculture, and industrial biotechnology.

The past two decades have witnessed a data revolution in microbiology. Large-scale sequencing initiatives like the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), and the Tara Oceans expedition have generated petabytes of publicly available metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, providing an unprecedented snapshot of microbial diversity and genetic potential across Earth's biomes. Concurrently, the field of systems biology has matured, particularly in the area of genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs). GEMs are mathematical representations of an organism's entire metabolic network, capable of predicting growth rates and metabolic fluxes under defined environmental conditions. Thousands of high-quality, curated GEMs are now available in public repositories like BiGG and KBase, and methods exist to automatically generate models from genomic data.

Despite these parallel advances, a significant gap remains in our ability to connect genomic potential to emergent community function. Early studies primarily focused on correlating taxonomic composition with environmental variables or host phenotype, offering limited mechanistic insight. More recent approaches have attempted to bridge this gap. For instance, community-level metabolic modeling frameworks like COMETS and MICOM have shown promise in simulating simple consortia by combining individual GEMs. These studies have successfully predicted cross-feeding interactions and community growth dynamics in vitro. However, they face significant challenges when scaling to the complexity of natural communities, which can contain hundreds or thousands of species. Furthermore, most models rely solely on genomic data, which represents metabolic potential rather than actual activity. The integration of metatranscriptomic data, which reflects gene expression and thus active metabolic pathways, is crucial for accurate functional prediction but remains a formidable technical hurdle.

Consequently, we lack a generalizable, data-driven framework to decipher the 'rules of life' for microbial community assembly and function. Current knowledge is often ecosystem-specific, and the fundamental principles of metabolic network topology, niche partitioning, and functional redundancy that confer stability and resilience across diverse environments are poorly understood. We do not know if there are universal patterns of metabolic interdependence, or how these patterns are shaped by environmental pressures. This proposal addresses this critical knowledge gap. The research is exceptionally timely, as it leverages the confluence of massive public datasets and mature modeling techniques. By synthesizing these disparate resources, this Working Group will move beyond descriptive studies to build a predictive, mechanistic framework. This project is perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission, as it requires a large-scale, multidisciplinary effort to synthesize public data to answer a fundamental question about emergence in cellular biosciences—an endeavor far beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this Working Group is to synthesize public multi-omics data and metabolic models to derive a set of generalizable principles that govern the assembly, stability, and metabolic function of microbial communities. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: What are the conserved patterns of metabolic interdependence and competition that structure microbial communities across diverse environments?**
This question targets the fundamental nature of species interactions. We hypothesize that despite vast taxonomic and environmental diversity, the underlying metabolic interaction networks are constrained and exhibit conserved topological features.
*   **Hypothesis 1a: Metabolic complementarity and syntrophy are primary drivers of stable species co-existence.** We predict that stable communities will be enriched in metabolic 'handoffs' where the waste product of one species is the substrate for another. We further predict that these interactions will form conserved network motifs (e.g., obligate producer-consumer pairs for essential amino acids or vitamins, short metabolic cycles) that are statistically overrepresented in communities from diverse environments (gut, soil, ocean).
*   **Hypothesis 1b: Metabolic niche overlap is a primary driver of competitive exclusion and dictates community composition.** We predict that the degree of overlap in the predicted substrate utilization profiles (the 'metabolic niche') between any two species will be inversely correlated with their frequency of co-occurrence in real-world samples, after controlling for environmental factors and phylogenetic relationships. Species that persist together will exhibit significant niche partitioning.
*   **Validation:** We will test these hypotheses by first constructing thousands of community-specific metabolic interaction networks using our proposed pipeline. For H1a, we will use network analysis algorithms to identify and count recurring motifs and correlate their prevalence with community stability metrics (e.g., low temporal variance in longitudinal datasets). For H1b, we will compute a metabolic niche overlap score for all species pairs and use statistical models to test for a significant negative relationship with co-occurrence data from the EMP and HMP datasets.

**Research Question 2: How does the integration of metatranscriptomic data refine predictions of community metabolic function compared to predictions based on metagenomic potential alone?**
This question addresses the critical gap between genetic potential and in-situ activity. We hypothesize that incorporating gene expression data is essential for accurate functional prediction.
*   **Hypothesis 2a: Transcriptomic constraints significantly improve the accuracy of predicted metabolic outputs.** We predict that community metabolic models constrained by metatranscriptomic data will yield metabolite production profiles that correlate significantly better with experimentally measured metabolomic data than models based on genomic potential alone.
*   **Hypothesis 2b: Transcriptional regulation facilitates dynamic niche partitioning among species with similar genomic capabilities.** We predict that co-occurring, closely related species will show divergent expression profiles for metabolic pathways, effectively partitioning the available resources in real-time, a phenomenon invisible from a purely genomic perspective.
*   **Validation:** We will leverage datasets with paired metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic data (e.g., HMP2 IBDMDB). For H2a, we will compare the Pearson correlation between predicted and measured metabolite concentrations for models run with and without transcriptomic constraints. For H2b, we will quantify the functional redundancy between species pairs based on genomics and then on transcriptomics, predicting a significant reduction in redundancy when expression is considered.

**Research Question 3: Can a minimal set of 'assembly rules' predict the stability and primary metabolic function of a community from its constituent genomes and their interactions?**
This is our ultimate synthesis goal: to distill our complex findings into predictive principles.
*   **Hypothesis 3a: Community stability and function are predictable from a combination of genomic features and predicted metabolic network topology.** We predict that a machine learning model, trained on features such as species' metabolic capabilities, the density of cooperative interactions, and the degree of niche overlap, can accurately classify communities as stable/unstable or as high/low producers of key functional metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids).
*   **Hypothesis 3b: Functional stability is maintained by metabolic role redundancy, not necessarily taxonomic redundancy.** We predict that the key features identified by our machine learning model will relate to the presence of core metabolic roles (e.g., 'primary fermenter', 'vitamin producer') that can be filled by taxonomically distinct organisms. Communities with diverse taxa filling these same core roles will exhibit similar stability.
*   **Validation:** We will train supervised machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using the vast dataset of community features generated in RQ1 and RQ2. H3a will be validated using rigorous cross-validation and testing on held-out datasets from distinct environments. For H3b, we will use feature importance metrics (e.g., SHAP values) to identify the key metabolic roles and then test whether communities with different taxonomic compositions but similar 'role compositions' have similar stability profiles.

Methods And Approach

This project's success hinges on a transdisciplinary Working Group and a novel, robust computational pipeline designed for large-scale data synthesis. Our team comprises microbial ecologists, systems biologists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists, ensuring the necessary expertise for every project phase. The work is structured into three sequential but overlapping phases.

**Phase 1: Data Aggregation, Curation, and Processing (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase involves assembling a massive, harmonized multi-omics dataset. 
*   **Data Sources:** We will exclusively use publicly available data. Primary sources include metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP1, HMP2), the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP500), the Tara Oceans project, and other large-scale studies available on NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We will target an initial cohort of over 5,000 metagenomes and 1,000 metatranscriptomes with rich environmental metadata. For validation, we will use paired metabolomics data from sources like the HMP2 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi-omics Database (IBDMDB) and the MetaboLights repository.
*   **Standardized Processing:** To ensure comparability, all raw sequencing data will be processed through a single, containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipeline. This includes: (1) Quality control and adapter trimming using KneadData; (2) Metagenomic assembly using MEGAHIT; (3) Binning of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using MetaBAT2; (4) Taxonomic classification of MAGs and unassembled reads using GTDB-Tk; and (5) Functional annotation using Prokka and eggNOG-mapper.

**Phase 2: Community-Scale Metabolic Modeling and Interaction Prediction (Months 6-24)**
This is the core analytical phase where we translate genomic data into metabolic function.
*   **Genome-Scale Model (GEM) Reconstruction:** For each sample, we will create a collection of GEMs representing the community members. We will first retrieve high-quality, manually curated models for species present in the sample from databases like BiGG and AGORA. For MAGs and species without existing models, we will generate them de novo using the CarveMe pipeline, which has been shown to produce high-quality models.
*   **Community Simulation:** We will use the MICOM (Microbial Community Modeling) framework to simulate community metabolism. MICOM applies flux balance analysis (FBA) to a combined community model, using a cooperative trade-off objective function that maximizes community growth rate while allowing for individual organism optimization. This approach has been validated for predicting species interactions and growth rates. The inputs will be the collection of GEMs and a defined in-silico growth medium based on the sample's environment (e.g., high-fiber diet for gut, marine nutrient profile for ocean).
*   **Transcriptomic Integration:** For samples with metatranscriptomic data, we will integrate gene expression levels as constraints on the metabolic models. Reads will be mapped to the coding sequences within the GEMs, and the resulting expression levels will be used to constrain the maximum allowable flux through each corresponding reaction. We will employ established algorithms like GIMME or iMAT, which selectively activate reactions based on expression evidence, thus tailoring the metabolic network to its active state.
*   **Interaction Network Inference:** From the solved FBA models, we will explicitly calculate the flux of every metabolite exchanged between every pair of organisms. This will generate a directed, weighted metabolic interaction network for each of the thousands of communities. The nodes are species, and the edges represent metabolite exchange, weighted by flux rate.

**Phase 3: Network Analysis, Pattern Mining, and Rule Discovery (Months 18-36)**
In this final phase, we will synthesize the results from thousands of simulations to uncover general principles.
*   **Cross-Community Network Analysis:** We will apply algorithms from network science to our database of interaction networks. We will identify conserved topological features, network motifs (e.g., three-species food chains), and community roles (e.g., 'keystone' producers). We will use statistical methods to determine which features are significantly enriched in specific environments or are associated with community stability.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** To derive 'assembly rules', we will employ supervised machine learning. Features for the models will include genomic properties of community members (e.g., genome size, pathway completeness), predicted network properties (e.g., density of cooperation, niche overlap), and environmental metadata. The target variables will be community-level outcomes like stability (for longitudinal data) or functional output (e.g., butyrate production level). We will use models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and interpret them using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the most predictive features, which we will frame as 'rules'.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete Phase 1. Develop and validate the full computational pipeline on the HMP dataset. Milestone: Public release of the open-source pipeline and processed data for 1,000 samples.
*   **Year 2:** Complete large-scale model construction and simulation for all datasets (Phase 2). Begin network analysis (Phase 3). Milestone: A comprehensive, public database of predicted metabolic interaction networks for >5,000 communities. Host a mid-project Working Group workshop.
*   **Year 3:** Complete machine learning and rule discovery. Validate predictions against metabolomic data. Prepare manuscripts and dissemination materials. Milestone: Publication of key findings in a high-impact journal and launch of a web portal for data exploration. Host a final dissemination workshop.

This 'atlas' will allow researchers to explore the metabolic roles of uncultured organisms, identify keystone species, and generate new, testable hypotheses about microbial community structure. It will serve as a foundational resource for the field for years to come.
3.  **Discovery of Fundamental 'Rules of Life':** By synthesizing across this vast dataset, we expect to uncover generalizable principles—the 'rules'—of microbial community assembly.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, are a major global health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite significant advances in our understanding of these diseases, their molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely elusive.

The study of viral evolution is a rapidly evolving field, with new insights and discoveries being made on a regular basis. Despite this, there are still many unanswered questions and gaps in our understanding. Viruses are known to evolve rapidly, often in response to changes in their environment, such as the immune response of their hosts. However, the mechanisms underlying this rapid evolution are not fully understood. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals a number of key areas where our understanding is limited. For example, while it is known that viruses can acquire new genetic material through recombination and mutation, the factors that influence these processes are not well understood. Similarly, the role of host-virus interactions in driving viral evolution is a topic of ongoing research. This project is timely and important because it will address these gaps in our understanding by synthesizing existing data on viral evolution. By bringing together experts in biology, computer science, and medicine, we will be able to tackle these complex questions from multiple angles, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of viral evolution.

Based on our current understanding of viral evolution, we hypothesize that both viral and host factors play a crucial role in driving viral evolution. We predict that by integrating molecular and cellular data, we will be able to identify key patterns and trends in viral evolution. These insights will provide a foundation for future research and could potentially lead to the development of new strategies for preventing and treating viral infections.

ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_01,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Grammar of Cellular Architecture: Emergent Organization from Multi-modal Imaging and Proteomics Data Synthesis,"A fundamental question in cell biology is whether universal principles govern the spatial organization of organelles and protein complexes, giving rise to robust cellular function. This project posits that a 'grammar of cellular architecture' exists, where local molecular interactions and physical constraints lead to emergent, predictable global organization. We propose to decipher this grammar by synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets that are currently siloed. This working group will bring together cell biologists, computer scientists specializing in vision and AI, biophysicists, and systems biologists to integrate high-content imaging data from repositories like the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the Human Cell Atlas with quantitative proteomics data from PRIDE and BioPlex. Our primary objective is to develop a novel computational framework, 'CellArchitect', that uses deep learning to segment and map the 3D spatial distribution and co-localization of thousands of proteins and organelles across millions of cells. By correlating these spatial maps with protein-protein interaction networks and functional annotations, we will move beyond simple co-localization to build predictive models of subcellular organization. We will employ methods from statistical physics and network theory to identify conserved spatial motifs, quantify organizational entropy, and derive rules that predict how perturbations to a single component cascade to alter the entire cellular architecture. This project is beyond the scope of any single lab due to the immense scale of the data and the required diversity of expertise. The outcomes will include a foundational, queryable 4D atlas of the cell, novel algorithms for multi-modal data integration, and fundamental insights into how cellular form and function emerge from molecular parts. This initiative will train a new generation of scientists at the interface of cell imaging, proteomics, and AI, with all models, code, and integrated data products made fully open-access to the scientific community.",,"Background And Significance

The eukaryotic cell is a paragon of emergent complexity, a highly structured, dynamic entity where precise spatial organization is inextricably linked to function. From the segregation of biochemical reactions within membrane-bound organelles to the assembly of signaling complexes at specific subcellular locales, cellular architecture underpins all life processes. For decades, cell biologists have meticulously cataloged the cell's components and their individual functions. However, a comprehensive, predictive understanding of how these components assemble into a coherent, functioning whole remains one of the most significant unresolved challenges in modern biology. We lack a unifying framework—a 'grammar'—that explains how local molecular interactions give rise to global, emergent cellular form.

The current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data generated by two parallel technological revolutions. On one hand, advances in microscopy, including super-resolution, light-sheet, and cryo-electron tomography, have provided breathtaking views of the cell's interior. Large-scale initiatives like the Allen Cell Explorer and the Human Protein Atlas, along with public repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR), have made petabytes of high-resolution imaging data publicly available. These resources offer unprecedented spatial information on the localization of thousands of proteins and organelles. On the other hand, the proteomics revolution, driven by high-throughput mass spectrometry, has systematically mapped the cell's protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Techniques like affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent labeling (e.g., BioID, APEX), curated in databases like BioPlex and STRING, have generated comprehensive 'parts lists' and wiring diagrams of molecular machinery.

Despite the power of these individual approaches, a critical gap exists: these vast imaging and proteomics datasets remain largely siloed. We have detailed maps of *where* proteins are located and separate maps of *what* proteins interact with, but we lack a systematic, large-scale integration of these two fundamental aspects of cellular organization. Current studies are often limited to a few proteins at a time, or they analyze organization in a static, averaged manner, failing to capture the cell-to-cell variability and dynamic nature of the system. Consequently, our understanding is often descriptive rather than predictive. We can observe that the endoplasmic reticulum makes contact with mitochondria, but we cannot predict from first principles how the density and structure of these contacts will change in response to metabolic stress. This inability to bridge the gap from molecular interactions to cellular architecture represents a major barrier to progress in understanding cellular function in health and disease.

This research is both important and timely for several reasons. First, the sheer volume and quality of publicly available data have reached a critical mass where a large-scale synthesis is not only possible but essential to extract maximal value. Second, recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning for image segmentation (e.g., CellPose, U-Net) and graph neural networks for analyzing complex relationships, provide the necessary computational tools to tackle this challenge at an unprecedented scale. Third, addressing this fundamental question has profound implications. A predictive model of cellular organization would transform our ability to understand diseases characterized by architectural defects, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and ciliopathies. It would also provide a foundational blueprint for synthetic biology, enabling the rational design of cells with novel functions. By synthesizing existing data to uncover the universal principles of cellular self-organization, this project will address a grand challenge in biology, moving the field from a descriptive to a predictive science of the cell.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is founded on the central hypothesis that the spatial organization of the eukaryotic cell is governed by a discoverable set of rules—a 'grammar'—where local protein-protein interactions and biophysical constraints give rise to emergent, predictable, and functionally optimized global architectures. We will test this overarching hypothesis through three specific, interconnected research aims.

**Aim 1: To develop a multi-modal computational framework, 'CellArchitect', for integrating large-scale imaging and proteomics data to create a unified, spatially-resolved map of cellular organization.** This aim addresses the foundational challenge of data integration, creating the resource upon which subsequent discoveries will be built.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can a unified deep learning pipeline accurately and automatically segment organelles and determine protein distributions from heterogeneous, multi-source public imaging data, thereby creating a standardized spatial coordinate system for the cell?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a federated learning model, leveraging a 3D U-Net architecture pre-trained on diverse datasets (e.g., Human Protein Atlas, OpenCell), can be fine-tuned to achieve robust, cross-dataset segmentation of at least ten major organelles and protein clusters with an average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.85. This will enable the mapping of thousands of proteins onto a canonical cellular reference frame, normalizing for variations in cell size, shape, and imaging modality.
*   **Research Question 1.2:** How can we probabilistically fuse non-spatial protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with spatial co-localization data to generate a high-confidence, spatially-aware interactome?
*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that a Bayesian integration model, which combines biochemical evidence from proteomics (e.g., AP-MS scores from BioPlex) with spatial co-occurrence statistics (e.g., voxel-level correlation from our imaging pipeline), will significantly outperform either data type alone in predicting functionally related protein modules. This will result in a spatially-resolved interactome where interaction probabilities are conditional on subcellular location.

**Aim 2: To identify and characterize conserved spatial motifs and organizational principles that constitute the 'grammar' of cellular architecture.** This aim seeks to extract fundamental rules from the integrated data map created in Aim 1.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Do recurrent, statistically significant spatial arrangements of proteins and organelles—'supramolecular motifs'—exist, and are they conserved across different cell types and functional states?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that graph-based mining of the spatially-resolved interactome will reveal a finite set of conserved motifs (e.g., a specific geometric arrangement of metabolic enzymes around a mitochondrial crista, or a defined sequence of signaling proteins at the plasma membrane) that occur far more frequently than predicted by random chance. We predict these motifs will represent fundamental functional units of cellular organization.
*   **Research Question 2.2:** Can we use principles from information theory and statistical physics to quantify the complexity, robustness, and efficiency of cellular organization?
*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** We hypothesize that cellular states can be characterized by a quantitative 'organizational entropy'. We predict that pluripotent stem cells will exhibit higher entropy (more organizational plasticity), while terminally differentiated cells will have lower entropy (a more fixed, optimized architecture). Furthermore, we predict that disease states, such as cancer, will be associated with an increase in organizational entropy, reflecting a breakdown of regulatory control.

**Aim 3: To build and validate a predictive model of cellular architecture that can simulate the systemic effects of local perturbations.** This aim represents the ultimate test of our derived 'grammar'.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can the organizational rules derived in Aim 2 be formalized into a computational model that accurately predicts the global reorganization of the cell in response to the removal or alteration of a single component?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that a generative model, such as a graph neural network (GNN) trained on the CellArchitect atlas, can predict the new steady-state spatial distributions of key proteins following the in silico knockout of a network hub protein. We predict the model's output will show a high degree of concordance (e.g., Earth Mover's Distance below a validated threshold) with experimental imaging data from corresponding CRISPR-mediated knockout cell lines available in public repositories like the IDR. This will demonstrate a truly predictive understanding of cellular self-organization.

*   **Imaging Data Sources:** We will systematically aggregate 3D imaging datasets from the Image Data Resource (IDR), the Allen Cell Explorer, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and the Chan Zuckerberg Institute's OpenCell project. Our selection criteria will prioritize datasets with high-resolution 3D stacks, multiple fluorescent channels, clear metadata (cell type, genetic background, treatment), and correspondence to cell lines with rich proteomics data (e.g., HEK293, HeLa, U2OS, A549). We will target an initial corpus of over 100 distinct studies, comprising millions of individual cell images.
*   **Proteomics Data Sources:** We will compile a comprehensive human interactome from primary repositories like BioPlex (AP-MS), HuRI (Y2H), and proximity-labeling data curated from the PRIDE archive. We will supplement this with functional annotations from Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway information from KEGG and Reactome. 
*   **Standardization Pipeline:** A critical first step is to develop an automated pipeline to convert all data into a unified format. Imaging data will be converted to the OME-Zarr cloud-optimized format, which supports scalable, parallel access. We will apply standardized intensity normalization and metadata mapping to create an analysis-ready collection. Proteomics data will be integrated into a single graph structure, with edges weighted by a composite score reflecting the strength and type of evidence for each interaction.

**Phase 2: The CellArchitect Framework - Integration and Mapping (Months 6-18)**
This phase focuses on the core technical development outlined in Aim 1.
*   **Module 1: Unified Image Analysis Pipeline:** We will develop a multi-scale, deep learning-based segmentation engine. First, a robust instance segmentation model (e.g., CellPose) will identify individual cells and nuclei. Second, within each cell, a 3D U-Net model, trained on manually annotated data from HPA and Allen Cell, will perform semantic segmentation of major organelles (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes). Third, for fluorescently tagged proteins, a dedicated convolutional neural network will classify their localization patterns (e.g., punctate, diffuse, filamentous) and quantify their distribution relative to the segmented organelles. To enable cross-cell comparison, we will implement a canonical coordinate system transformation for each cell, aligning them based on the nuclear centroid and principal axes.
*   **Module 2: Spatially-Resolved Interactome Construction:** We will bridge the imaging and proteomics data using a probabilistic framework. For every protein pair with evidence of a physical interaction from our proteomics graph, we will compute a suite of spatial co-occurrence metrics from the imaging data (e.g., Pearson's correlation, Manders' overlap coefficient, radial distribution functions). These spatial scores will be integrated with the biochemical interaction scores using a Bayesian network to yield a final probability for a 'spatially-active interaction'. The output will be a multi-layered graph representing the cell's spatially-resolved molecular network.

**Phase 3: Discovering the 'Grammar' of Organization (Months 15-30)**
With the integrated atlas, we will address Aim 2.
*   **Motif Discovery:** We will apply subgraph mining algorithms (e.g., gSpan) to the spatially-resolved interactome to identify recurrent patterns or 'motifs'. The statistical significance of these motifs will be rigorously tested against a null model generated by spatial permutation of protein locations, allowing us to distinguish true architectural principles from random co-occurrence.
*   **Quantification of Organizational Principles:** We will implement algorithms to compute the 'organizational entropy' for each cell based on the predictability of protein and organelle locations within the voxelized cell volume. We will use statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) to compare entropy across different cell types, cell cycle stages, and perturbation conditions, testing our hypotheses about organizational complexity.
*   **Rule Derivation:** Using machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees), we will build a classifier that learns the relationship between a protein's intrinsic properties (e.g., domain structure, network degree) and its emergent spatial properties. This will allow us to extract human-interpretable rules, such as 'Proteins containing a PX domain that interact with PI3P-binding proteins are localized to endosomes with 95% probability'.

**Phase 4: Predictive Modeling and Validation (Months 24-36)**
This final phase will test the predictive power of our derived grammar (Aim 3).
*   **Generative Model Development:** We will construct a predictive model using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. The model will take the PPI network and the state of a subset of proteins as input and learn to generate the 3D spatial coordinates for all other proteins in the cell. 
*   **In Silico Perturbations and Validation:** The model will be trained on the thousands of wild-type cells in our atlas. We will then validate its predictive power by performing in silico 'knockouts' (removing a node from the input graph) and comparing the model's predicted cellular reorganization to actual experimental data from public datasets featuring the corresponding gene knockout (e.g., from IDR). Quantitative comparison will be performed using metrics like the Wasserstein distance between predicted and observed protein distributions.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data curation (M9). Release of v1.0 of the segmentation and feature extraction pipeline (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Release of the first integrated spatially-resolved interactome for three cell lines (M18). Publication of the CellArchitect framework and initial findings on organizational entropy (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Complete motif discovery and rule derivation (M30). Validate the predictive GNN model against at least five different knockout datasets (M33). Public release of the full, queryable CellArchitect Atlas and all associated software tools (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The successful completion of this project will yield transformative outcomes, providing foundational resources, novel methodologies, and fundamental biological insights that will have a broad and lasting impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Foundational, Queryable 4D Atlas of the Cell:** The primary deliverable will be the 'CellArchitect Atlas,' a public, web-accessible resource that integrates spatial and molecular interaction data for thousands of proteins across millions of cells. This will be a paradigm-shifting resource, analogous to the reference human genome. It will empower researchers to ask complex questions that are currently intractable, such as, 'What is the consensus spatial arrangement of all components of the mTOR signaling pathway in response to nutrient starvation?' or 'Which protein-protein interactions are most significantly altered in their spatial context between a normal and a cancerous cell line?'. This atlas will serve as a central hub for hypothesis generation and data exploration for the entire cell biology community.
2.  **Novel, Open-Source Computational Tools:** We will develop and disseminate a suite of powerful, open-source software tools for the large-scale, integrative analysis of multi-modal biological data. The CellArchitect pipeline for automated image segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial-proteomic integration will be a significant methodological contribution, applicable to a wide range of biological imaging and systems biology problems. These tools will lower the barrier to entry for complex data synthesis, democratizing this research area.
3.  **Discovery of Fundamental Principles of Cellular Organization:** This project will move cell biology from a largely descriptive to a predictive science. By identifying conserved spatial motifs and deriving the 'grammatical rules' of cellular architecture, we will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how robust cellular form and function emerge from molecular parts. This will represent a fundamental advance in our understanding of self-organization in living systems, a central theme in biology.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Advancing Human Health:** A predictive understanding of cellular architecture has profound implications for medicine. The organizational entropy metric we propose could serve as a novel, quantitative biomarker for disease states like cancer, where cellular disorganization is a hallmark. Our predictive models could be used to screen for therapeutic compounds that restore normal cellular architecture or to understand the mechanisms of drug action at a systems level. This work will provide a new lens through which to view diseases of cellular organization, including neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and viral infections.
2.  **Enabling Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** The rational design of synthetic cells and biological circuits is currently limited by our incomplete understanding of spatial organization. The rules and models generated by this project will provide a 'design blueprint' for synthetic biologists, enabling them to engineer cells with novel functions by precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of components.
3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Scientists:** As mandated by the research call, this project is intrinsically designed for training. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work at the intersection of cell biology, AI, and biophysics, acquiring a unique and highly sought-after skillset. Through collaborative workshops and open-source software development, they will become leaders in the emerging field of quantitative, data-driven cell biology, directly contributing to the development of a future-ready scientific workforce.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
Our commitment to open science is absolute. All curated data, source code for all models and pipelines, and the final CellArchitect Atlas will be made publicly available under permissive licenses (e.g., MIT for code, CC-BY for data). We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. We will actively disseminate our work through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ASCB, ISMB, NeurIPS) and will host annual workshops to train the broader scientific community on how to use our data resources and computational tools. The project's long-term vision is to establish the CellArchitect Atlas as a living, community-driven resource that will be continuously updated and expanded, ensuring its sustained impact on the biosciences.

ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_02,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,Viral Hijacking and Host Response: A Pan-viral Synthesis of Host-Pathogen Interactomes,"Viruses are master manipulators of cellular machinery, but the common principles and evolutionary trade-offs governing their strategies remain poorly understood. This project will address a long-standing puzzle: what are the conserved molecular 'choke points' in the host cell that are targeted by diverse viruses, and how do host defense networks evolve to counter these attacks? We will assemble a multidisciplinary team of virologists, immunologists, bioinformaticians, and evolutionary biologists to conduct a community-scale synthesis of all publicly available host-pathogen interaction data. Our working group will integrate disparate datasets including transcriptomics (GEO, SRA), proteomics (PRIDE), and protein-protein interaction data (BioGRID, IntAct) spanning hundreds of different viral infections in human and other host species. The core of our approach is to build a multi-layered, pan-viral interaction network. We will develop novel graph-based machine learning algorithms to identify 'viral hijacking modules'—sets of host proteins and pathways consistently targeted by unrelated viruses—and corresponding 'emergent host defense modules'—conserved transcriptional and signaling responses that constitute the core of the intrinsic immune system. By comparing the strategies of DNA vs. RNA viruses, or acute vs. persistent viruses, we will uncover the evolutionary logic behind different hijacking strategies. This synthesis is impossible for a single lab, requiring expertise in virology to curate data, computer science to build the network models, and evolutionary biology to interpret the results. The project will produce a comprehensive, open-access 'Viral Interactome Atlas,' providing an invaluable resource for predicting the cellular impact of emerging viruses and identifying novel, broad-spectrum antiviral targets. Trainees will gain unique cross-disciplinary skills in data integration, network biology, and computational virology.",,"Background And Significance

Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, engage in a complex and dynamic interplay with their hosts, representing a quintessential example of a co-evolutionary arms race. To replicate, viruses must commandeer the host's molecular machinery for transcription, translation, and energy production while simultaneously evading sophisticated immune surveillance systems. This intimate relationship has been the subject of intense study for decades, yielding deep insights into the infection cycles of individual pathogens. Seminal works have elucidated how influenza virus's NS1 protein antagonizes interferon signaling, how HIV's Vif protein degrades the host antiviral factor APOBEC3G, and how human papillomavirus E6 and E7 proteins subvert cell cycle control by targeting p53 and pRb. These studies, while foundational, have predominantly focused on a single virus or a single family of viruses. Consequently, our understanding of host-pathogen interactions remains highly fragmented, resembling a collection of detailed but disconnected case studies rather than a unified theoretical framework. The central gap in our knowledge is the absence of a systems-level, pan-viral perspective. We lack a comprehensive understanding of the common principles and convergent strategies employed by diverse, unrelated viruses to manipulate the host cell. Are there universal cellular vulnerabilities—molecular 'choke points'—that are repeatedly exploited? Conversely, does the host mount a conserved, core defense response that represents an emergent property of the cellular network, independent of the specific viral trigger? Answering these questions has been historically intractable due to methodological and data limitations. However, the landscape has been transformed by two key developments. First, the explosion of high-throughput 'omics' technologies has led to an unprecedented accumulation of publicly available data. Repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and the PRIDE Archive now house thousands of datasets detailing the transcriptomic and proteomic consequences of viral infections across a vast array of viruses and host systems. Concurrently, databases such as BioGRID and IntAct have systematically curated tens of thousands of individual virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This wealth of data represents a massively underutilized resource for discovering higher-order biological principles. Second, recent advances in computer science, particularly in network biology and machine learning, provide the analytical tools necessary to integrate these vast, heterogeneous datasets and extract meaningful patterns. Previous attempts at meta-analysis have been limited in scope, often focusing on a single data type (e.g., PPIs only) or a small subset of viruses, failing to capture the multi-faceted nature of the host response. This project is therefore both important and timely. The recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a stark reminder of the threat posed by emerging viral pathogens and underscored the urgent need for strategies to rapidly understand and combat novel viruses. By synthesizing the entirety of available public data, we can move beyond virus-specific details to uncover the fundamental rules of engagement in the host-virus conflict. This community-scale effort, which requires the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and evolutionary theorists, is perfectly aligned with the call to address fundamental questions through data synthesis. It will not only solve a long-standing puzzle in molecular and cellular biology but also provide a powerful new resource for predicting the impact of future pandemics and identifying the next generation of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this project is to define the conserved principles of viral manipulation and host defense by synthesizing the global corpus of host-pathogen interaction data. We will move beyond single-pathogen studies to address fundamental questions about the emergent properties of these complex biological systems. Our research is structured around four specific, interconnected questions, each with testable hypotheses.

**Research Question 1: What are the conserved molecular modules within the host cell that are convergently targeted by phylogenetically diverse viruses?**
We posit that the intricate and interconnected nature of the host cellular network creates inherent vulnerabilities, or 'choke points', that diverse viruses have independently evolved to exploit. 
*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1): Viral Convergence on Cellular Hubs.** Viruses from distinct families will convergently target a limited set of host proteins and pathways that are topologically central or functionally critical within the host interactome. These 'viral hijacking modules' are not random but are enriched for specific cellular functions essential for viral replication and immune evasion.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that our pan-viral network analysis will identify a statistically significant over-representation of viral interactions with host modules involved in core processes like mRNA translation (e.g., ribosomal subunits, eIF4F complex), nucleocytoplasmic transport (e.g., importins, nuclear pore components), protein degradation (e.g., ubiquitin ligases, proteasome subunits), and central metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway). We will validate these computationally identified modules by assessing their enrichment for known broad-spectrum antiviral drug targets and host dependency factors identified in genome-wide CRISPR screens.

**Research Question 2: Can we define a core, 'pan-viral host defense program' that represents an emergent, conserved response to diverse viral infections?**
While each virus elicits unique cellular responses, we hypothesize that an underlying, conserved defense network is activated as a general anti-pathogen state.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2): Emergence of a Core Defense Network.** Integration of multi-omic data will reveal a core set of host genes, proteins, and signaling pathways whose activity is consistently perturbed across a majority of viral infections, forming a robust, emergent host defense module. 
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict this module will include, but extend beyond, the canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). It will encompass specific stress response pathways (e.g., integrated stress response, UPR), metabolic reprogramming signatures (e.g., shifts away from anabolic pathways), and post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation cascades) that are consistently observed regardless of the infecting virus's family. We will test this by comparing the transcriptional and proteomic signatures across hundreds of infection datasets and using permutation testing to define a statistically robust core response.

**Research Question 3: How do viral hijacking strategies correlate with fundamental viral characteristics, such as genome type, replication site, and chronicity?**
The evolutionary trade-offs faced by a virus are shaped by its basic biology. We hypothesize that these constraints dictate the specific sets of host modules it targets.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3): Biological Constraints Shape Hijacking Strategy.** A virus's hijacking strategy is non-random and predictable based on its biological properties. For example, RNA viruses will preferentially target host RNA-binding proteins and splicing machinery, while persistent viruses (e.g., herpesviruses) will target apoptotic and cell cycle checkpoints more subtly than acute, lytic viruses (e.g., influenza).
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We will classify all viruses in our dataset and perform comparative analyses. We predict that statistical tests (e.g., enrichment analysis, MANOVA) will reveal significant differences in the host modules targeted by DNA vs. RNA viruses, nuclear vs. cytoplasmic replicating viruses, and acute vs. persistent viruses. For instance, we expect to find that persistent viruses are significantly enriched for interactions with host anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 family) and immune modulators (e.g., MHC class I pathway components).

**Research Question 4: Can the identified modules be leveraged to predict the cellular impact of emerging viruses and identify novel, broad-spectrum antiviral targets?**
A key outcome of this synthesis is the creation of a predictive framework.
*   **Hypothesis 4 (H4): Network Modules Have Predictive Power.** The identified hijacking and defense modules constitute a functional map of the host-virus interface that can be used to predict which host factors a novel virus is likely to target and to prioritize host proteins as high-confidence, broad-spectrum antiviral drug targets.
*   **Prediction & Validation:** We will build a machine learning model trained on our network to predict host targets based on viral protein sequence features. We will test its performance on a hold-out set of viruses not used in training. We will predict that proteins central to multiple hijacking modules, but with low connectivity in the uninfected host network, represent ideal broad-spectrum targets, as their inhibition would be highly disruptive to many viruses but potentially less toxic to the host. These predictions will generate a prioritized list of targets for future experimental validation.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale computational synthesis effort that will proceed in three integrated phases. Our multidisciplinary team has the requisite expertise in virology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and network biology to execute this ambitious plan.

**Phase 1: Data Aggregation, Curation, and Harmonization (Months 1-12)**
This foundational phase focuses on building the comprehensive data resource that will underpin all subsequent analyses. This task is beyond the scope of a single lab and requires a coordinated working group.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically mine all relevant publicly available data. 
    *   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** We will aggregate data from major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, MINT, and the virus-specific VirHostNet. We will capture both virus-host and host-host interactions, along with associated experimental evidence codes.
    *   **Transcriptomics:** Using the NCBI API and custom scripts, we will query GEO, SRA, and ArrayExpress for all datasets related to viral infection in human and key model organisms (e.g., mouse, macaque). We will develop a rigorous set of inclusion criteria, requiring, for example, the presence of mock-infected controls, sufficient biological replicates (n≥3), and detailed experimental metadata.
    *   **Proteomics and Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs):** We will retrieve datasets from the PRIDE archive and PhosphoSitePlus, focusing on studies that quantify changes in protein abundance or phosphorylation status upon infection.
*   **Standardized Processing Pipeline:** To ensure comparability and minimize batch effects, all raw transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) will be reprocessed through a single, containerized pipeline (e.g., using Nextflow). This pipeline will include quality control (FastQC), adapter trimming (Trimmomatic), alignment to a reference genome (STAR), and quantification (RSEM). Differential expression analysis will be consistently performed using DESeq2. All genes, proteins, and viruses will be mapped to stable, standardized identifiers (Ensembl, UniProt, NCBI Taxonomy).

**Phase 2: Multi-Layer Network Construction and Module Discovery (Months 10-24)**
This phase involves the core intellectual and methodological innovation of the project.
*   **Network Construction:** We will construct a heterogeneous, multi-layered network. Nodes in the network will represent host proteins/genes and viral proteins. Edges will represent different types of biological relationships, each forming a distinct layer: 1) physical PPIs, 2) regulatory interactions (inferred from consistent differential gene expression), and 3) post-translational modifications (e.g., kinase-substrate relationships inferred from phosphoproteomics). Edges will be weighted based on the strength and consistency of evidence across multiple datasets.
*   **Novel Module Discovery Algorithm:** Standard community detection algorithms are ill-suited for identifying 'targeted' modules in a multi-layered, bipartite network. We will develop a novel graph-based machine learning approach, likely a Graph Attention Network (GAT) or a similar Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. This algorithm will be trained to learn node embeddings that capture both the topological properties within the host network and the interaction patterns with diverse viral proteins. 'Viral hijacking modules' will be identified as communities of host nodes that are recurrently and significantly targeted by proteins from phylogenetically diverse viruses. 'Emergent host defense modules' will be identified as densely connected host nodes that exhibit consistent activation signatures (e.g., upregulation, phosphorylation) across a wide range of viral infections.

**Phase 3: Comparative Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, and Resource Development (Months 18-36)**
In this final phase, we will use the constructed network and identified modules to test our hypotheses and create a lasting public resource.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** We will employ a rigorous statistical framework. For H1 (Convergence), we will use permutation testing to assess whether the observed targeting of specific modules by diverse viruses is greater than expected by chance. For H2 (Core Defense), we will define a core response set and analyze its functional and topological properties. For H3 (Strategy Correlation), we will use multivariate statistical methods to correlate viral traits (e.g., genome type) with the specific sets of host modules they target. For H4 (Prediction), we will use the network to train a predictive model and validate it on held-out data.
*   **The Viral Interactome Atlas:** A key deliverable will be a public, web-based portal. This resource, built using modern web frameworks (e.g., React, D3.js), will allow users to visualize the pan-viral network, query specific viruses or host proteins, explore the identified modules, and download all underlying data and analysis results. 
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   **Year 1:** Complete data curation pipeline; release harmonized dataset v1.0. Develop and benchmark module discovery algorithm on a pilot dataset. 
    *   **Year 2:** Construct the full pan-viral multi-layer network. Identify and functionally annotate the first draft of hijacking and defense modules. Launch beta version of the Viral Interactome Atlas for community feedback. Submit methods paper.
    *   **Year 3:** Complete all comparative analyses and hypothesis testing. Finalize and publicly launch the Viral Interactome Atlas v1.0. Submit primary research articles. Host a community-wide dissemination workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on biomedical research and public health. Our expected outcomes are organized around advancing fundamental knowledge, developing novel resources and methods, training the next generation of scientists, and providing a direct pathway to new therapeutic strategies.

**Advancement of Scientific Knowledge:**
The primary outcome will be a paradigm shift from a virus-centric to a systems-level, pan-viral understanding of host-pathogen interactions. By identifying conserved 'viral hijacking modules,' we will uncover the fundamental cellular vulnerabilities that have been repeatedly exploited throughout evolutionary history. This will resolve the long-standing puzzle of whether common principles govern viral infection. Similarly, the characterization of an 'emergent host defense module' will provide a definitive, data-driven definition of the core intrinsic immune response, revealing the fundamental logic of how cells sense and react to a generic viral threat. These findings will provide a new conceptual framework for virology, cell biology, and immunology, with direct implications for understanding the emergent properties of complex biological networks.

**Development of a Lasting Community Resource:**
A major tangible outcome is the 'Viral Interactome Atlas.' This will not be a static data release but a dynamic, open-access web portal and knowledge base. It will serve as a central resource for the global research community, enabling any researcher to query their virus or host protein of interest and place it within the context of the entire known virus-host interactome. This will democratize access to large-scale systems analysis and will catalyze countless new hypotheses and research directions. For example, a researcher studying a newly discovered virus could use the Atlas to generate immediate, data-driven hypotheses about its mechanism of action, dramatically accelerating the research cycle. The underlying code, data, and network models will be openly shared, fostering reproducibility and further methodological innovation.

**Broader Impacts on Human Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**
The impact of this work extends directly to public health. The identified hijacking modules are, by definition, critical for the replication of many different viruses. The host proteins within these modules therefore represent a rich source of high-confidence targets for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Such host-targeted therapies are less prone to the development of viral resistance and could be deployed against newly emerging pathogens for which specific drugs do not yet exist. The Atlas will become a critical tool for pandemic preparedness, allowing for rapid in silico analysis of novel pathogens to predict their cellular targets and suggest potential therapeutic interventions.

**Training and Workforce Development:**
This project is an ideal training vehicle for the next generation of data-savvy scientists. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be co-mentored by experts in disparate fields, gaining unique cross-disciplinary skills in computational biology, data integration, machine learning, network science, and virology. They will learn to manage large-scale collaborative projects, adhere to open science principles, and communicate effectively across disciplines. Through hands-on participation in working group meetings and workshops, they will build a professional network that will serve them throughout their careers. This training directly addresses the critical need for a workforce that can leverage the growing deluge of biological data to solve complex problems.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Sustainability:**
We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, presentations at major international conferences, and the public launch of the Atlas. We will host a final workshop to share our results with the broader community and foster new collaborations. The project is designed for long-term sustainability; the Atlas will be built with a framework for community-driven updates. We will seek follow-on funding to maintain and expand the resource, ensuring it remains a valuable and up-to-date hub for the systems virology community long after the initial funding period concludes.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a large-scale, community-level synthesis effort that requires significant and coordinated resources beyond the capacity of any single lab or existing collaboration. The budget is designed to support a distributed team of ten PIs and their trainees over a three-year period, with a focus on personnel, collaboration, and computational infrastructure.

**1. Personnel (Approximately 70% of total budget):**
*   **Principal Investigators (10 PIs):** We request 1.0 month of summer salary per year for each PI. This is essential to provide the dedicated time required for project leadership, intensive data analysis and interpretation, trainee mentorship, and coordination of the working group.
*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (4 FTEs):** Four full-time postdocs are the core engine of this project. Two will have strong computational backgrounds, leading the development of the data processing pipelines and novel machine learning algorithms. Two will have deep expertise in virology and molecular biology, leading the critical tasks of data curation, functional annotation of modules, and biological interpretation of results. 
*   **Graduate Students (4 FTEs):** Four graduate students will be supported to work on specific sub-projects, such as implementing components of the web portal, performing comparative evolutionary analyses, or applying the network model to specific viral families. This is a cornerstone of our training plan.
*   **Project Manager/Data Scientist (0.5 FTE):** A half-time professional will be hired to manage the complex logistics of a 10-lab collaboration, ensure milestones are met, oversee compliance with open science policies, and manage the data repository.

**2. Travel (Approximately 10%):**
*   **Working Group Meetings:** We request funds for the entire team (PIs, postdocs, students) to meet in person twice annually. These intensive, multi-day workshops are indispensable for fostering genuine collaboration, resolving complex analytical challenges, and providing an immersive training experience for junior researchers. 
*   **Conference Travel:** Funds are allocated for each trainee and one PI per lab to attend one major international conference per year (e.g., ASV, ISMB) to present our findings, disseminate the resource, and receive community feedback.

**3. Computational Resources and Dissemination (Approximately 15%):**
*   **Cloud Computing:** Significant funds are budgeted for cloud computing services (e.g., AWS S3 for storage, EC2 for computation). Reprocessing thousands of public RNA-seq datasets and training complex graph neural network models on a massive network requires computational power that exceeds standard university-provided resources.
*   **Web Server and Data Hosting:** We request funds for a dedicated server to host the Viral Interactome Atlas, ensuring high availability and performance for the global community. This also covers long-term data archiving costs on platforms like Zenodo.
*   **Publication Fees:** A budget is included to cover open-access publication fees for an anticipated 4-5 peer-reviewed articles, ensuring our work is freely accessible in accordance with open science principles.

**4. Indirect Costs (F&A) (Calculated based on lead institution's federally negotiated rate):**
This budget is critically dependent on NCEMS support. The scale of the data integration, the need for novel methodological development, and the requirement for a highly diverse, multi-disciplinary team place this project squarely within the scope of a community-scale synthesis project that cannot be accomplished otherwise.",,
ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_03,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,Metabolic Symbiosis in the Tumor Microenvironment: A Spatially-Resolved Multi-Omics Data Synthesis,"A tumor is not a monolith of cancer cells, but a complex ecosystem where diverse cell types—cancer, immune, and stromal—interact dynamically. A key emergent property of this ecosystem is metabolic symbiosis, where cells exchange metabolites to support collective growth, proliferation, and drug resistance. However, mapping these metabolic exchanges remains a major challenge. This project will tackle this challenge by synthesizing publicly available multi-omics data to build the first comprehensive, spatially-resolved metabolic map of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our working group, comprising cancer biologists, biochemists, computational modelers, and data scientists, will integrate genomic and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), proteomic data from CPTAC, and a growing number of public single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets. The central innovation will be the development of a new analytical pipeline that uses machine learning for cellular deconvolution of bulk data and integrates it with single-cell resolution data to assign metabolic pathways to specific cell types within the TME. We will then use constraint-based modeling (e.g., flux balance analysis) to predict the flow of metabolites between these cell populations, identifying critical symbiotic dependencies. This large-scale integration and modeling effort requires a collaborative team to handle the data heterogeneity and develop the sophisticated computational tools needed. The project will reveal how the collective metabolic network of the TME emerges from individual cell behaviors and how this emergent property contributes to cancer progression and therapy failure. Our findings will be disseminated through an open, interactive web portal, providing a powerful new tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets aimed at disrupting this deadly symbiosis. The project will also serve as a training ground for students and postdocs in the burgeoning field of computational systems oncology.",,"Background And Significance

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is now understood not as a passive scaffold for malignant cells, but as a complex, adaptive ecosystem whose emergent properties dictate cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic response. This ecosystem comprises a heterogeneous consortium of cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and a diverse array of immune cells. The collective behavior of this system arises from intricate, spatially-defined intercellular communication networks. A critical axis of this communication is metabolism. The century-old observation of the Warburg effect, where cancer cells favor glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, has evolved into a more nuanced understanding of metabolic plasticity and interdependence. It is now clear that a tumor's metabolic phenotype is a collective property, driven by a phenomenon known as metabolic symbiosis, where different cell populations exchange metabolites to optimize nutrient utilization and support mutual survival and growth. Seminal studies have illuminated pairwise symbiotic relationships. For instance, the 'reverse Warburg effect' describes how glycolytic CAFs secrete lactate, which is then taken up and utilized as a primary fuel source by oxidative cancer cells, thereby sparing glucose for other anabolic processes. This lactate shuttle, mediated by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), not only fuels cancer proliferation but also profoundly shapes the TME by inducing angiogenesis and suppressing immune function; high lactate levels are known to inhibit T-cell and natural killer cell activity. Beyond lactate, other metabolites like glutamine, ammonia, and lipids are actively exchanged between cancer cells and various stromal and immune populations, creating a web of metabolic dependencies. However, our current understanding of this metabolic web is fragmented and incomplete. The vast majority of studies have focused on simplified co-culture systems or have examined single metabolic pathways in isolation. This reductionist approach fails to capture the complexity and emergent nature of the TME's metabolic network. A key limitation has been the reliance on bulk-level analyses of tumor tissue. Bulk omics data, while powerful, averages the molecular signals from all constituent cell types, obscuring the cell-type-specific metabolic programs and the crucial intercellular exchanges that define the ecosystem. We lack a systems-level, spatially-resolved map of metabolic flux within the in-vivo TME. This knowledge gap represents a major barrier to developing effective metabolic therapies. Without understanding the full network of dependencies, therapeutic interventions targeting a single pathway may be circumvented by the system's metabolic plasticity. This project is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the explosion of publicly available multi-omics data, including thousands of tumor profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), provides an unprecedented substrate for data synthesis. Second, the recent surge in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets offers the potential to deconvolve the cellular heterogeneity of bulk tissues with ever-increasing resolution. Third, advances in computational systems biology, particularly in constraint-based modeling, provide the formalisms necessary to integrate these disparate data types and simulate metabolic function. By synthesizing these vast public data resources, this project will address a fundamental question in cancer biology: how does the collective metabolic network of a tumor emerge from the interactions of its constituent parts? Answering this question is beyond the scope of any single lab, requiring a transdisciplinary working group of cancer biologists, computational scientists, and systems modelers to integrate heterogeneous data and develop novel analytical strategies, perfectly aligning with the mission of this research call.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

The overarching goal of this research is to construct the first comprehensive, spatially-resolved atlas of metabolic symbiosis in the tumor microenvironment across multiple human cancers. By synthesizing a massive corpus of public multi-omics data, we aim to move beyond pairwise interactions and map the emergent, system-level metabolic network that drives tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. This goal is structured around four specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses. 

**Research Question 1: How do the metabolic phenotypes of distinct cell populations (cancer subclones, fibroblast subtypes, endothelial cells, immune infiltrates) co-vary within the TME, and how are they shaped by their local cellular neighborhood?**
This question addresses the fundamental issue of metabolic plasticity as a function of cellular context. We hypothesize that a cell's metabolic state is not an intrinsic, static property but is dynamically programmed by signals and metabolites from adjacent cells. 
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** The metabolic activity of cancer cells is a direct emergent property of their spatial proximity to specific stromal and immune cells. 
    *   **Prediction:** Our spatially-aware models will predict that cancer cells physically adjacent to lactate-secreting CAFs will exhibit significantly higher flux through oxidative phosphorylation pathways compared to cancer cells in fibroblast-poor regions. Conversely, cancer cells in immune-cell-rich 'hot' regions will exhibit distinct metabolic profiles compared to those in 'cold' regions. 
    *   **Validation:** We will validate this by correlating the predicted metabolic fluxes with the expression of metabolic pathway markers in spatially-resolved transcriptomics datasets. We will test for statistically significant associations between cell-type co-localization patterns and metabolic gene expression signatures across thousands of TCGA samples. 

**Research Question 2: What are the principal metabolic exchange networks that define symbiotic and competitive relationships within the TME, and which metabolites serve as the primary currencies of exchange?**
We aim to identify the key metabolic highways that connect different cell populations. 
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** A conserved set of metabolic exchange networks, centered on a lactate-glutamine-ammonia axis, forms the backbone of TME symbiosis across diverse solid tumor types (e.g., pancreatic, breast, lung). 
    *   **Prediction:** Our multi-cellular flux balance analysis will consistently predict high rates of lactate export from CAFs, lactate import by cancer cells, and a coupled exchange of glutamine and its byproducts between these and other cell types. 
    *   **Validation:** We will seek evidence for these predicted fluxes by examining the coordinated expression of key metabolite transporters (e.g., MCT1, MCT4, ASCT2) and metabolic enzymes in our deconvoluted TCGA data. A strong positive correlation in the expression of a CAF lactate exporter and a cancer cell lactate importer would support our prediction. 

**Research Question 3: How does the spatial architecture of the TME constrain the topology of the metabolic interaction network and create localized metabolic niches?**
This question links physical structure to metabolic function. 
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** The TME is organized into distinct metabolic niches, such as immunosuppressive niches characterized by high lactate and low glucose, which spatially exclude effector T-cells. 
    *   **Prediction:** Our models will identify spatial 'hotspots' of immunosuppressive metabolite production (e.g., lactate, kynurenine) that spatially anti-correlate with the predicted activity and infiltration of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. 
    *   **Validation:** We will use publicly available spatial proteomics (e.g., MIBI, CODEX) and transcriptomics data to confirm the predicted spatial segregation of immune cells from these metabolically hostile niches. 

**Research Question 4: Can we identify conserved metabolic dependencies within these symbiotic networks that represent robust, pan-cancer therapeutic vulnerabilities?**
This is the translational thrust of our project. 
*   **Hypothesis 4.1:** The metabolic network of the TME contains critical 'choke points'—enzymes or transporters essential for maintaining the symbiotic state—whose inhibition would cause a systemic collapse of the tumor ecosystem. 
    *   **Prediction:** In-silico gene/reaction knockout simulations in our community metabolic models will identify specific targets (e.g., a transporter on a stromal cell) whose removal leads to a significant reduction in cancer cell biomass production. 
    *   **Validation:** We will prioritize predicted targets by cross-referencing them with cancer dependency maps (e.g., DepMap) and clinical data to assess their potential as viable therapeutic targets. The top-ranked predictions will form the basis for future experimental collaborations.

Methods And Approach

This project will synthesize vast, publicly available datasets through a novel, multi-stage computational pipeline. Our approach is designed to systematically deconstruct the complexity of the TME, reconstruct its metabolic network, and simulate its behavior to uncover emergent properties. The project is organized into three synergistic Aims.

**Aim 1: Comprehensive Curation and Harmonization of Public Multi-Omics Data.**
The foundation of this synthesis project is the rigorous aggregation and processing of diverse data types. This effort requires significant bioinformatic expertise and is a key area where NCEMS support is critical.
*   **Data Sources:** We will leverage several major public data repositories. 
    1.  **Bulk Genomics/Proteomics:** We will download and process RNA-sequencing, copy number variation, mutation, and clinical data for all available solid tumor cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (~33 cancer types, >11,000 patients). This will be complemented by quantitative proteomics data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) for overlapping cohorts, providing a crucial layer of protein-level validation.
    2.  **Single-Cell Transcriptomics (scRNA-seq):** We will compile a comprehensive database of publicly available TME scRNA-seq studies from repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Human Cell Atlas. We will initially target major solid tumors (e.g., breast, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, melanoma), curating data from over 100 independent studies encompassing millions of cells. 
    3.  **Spatial Transcriptomics:** We will gather all available spatial transcriptomics datasets (e.g., 10x Visium, Slide-seq) for human tumors. This data is critical for providing the spatial context and ground truth for our models.
*   **Data Harmonization:** A major challenge is the heterogeneity of these datasets. We will develop a standardized processing pipeline to harmonize them. This includes: uniform alignment and quantification of sequencing data, batch correction across studies using algorithms like ComBat-seq, standardization of gene and protein nomenclature, and consistent clinical data annotation.

**Aim 2: Development and Application of a Spatially-Informed Cellular Deconvolution Framework.**
This Aim focuses on computationally dissecting bulk tumor data into its constituent cell-type-specific components, a key innovation of our proposal.
*   **Step 1: Building a TME Cell Type Signature Matrix:** Using the harmonized scRNA-seq data from Aim 1, we will perform unsupervised clustering and expert-guided annotation to identify all major cell populations and their subtypes (e.g., cancer epithelial, myofibroblastic vs. inflammatory CAFs, M1 vs. M2 macrophages, T-cell subtypes). We will then use statistical methods to define a robust, context-specific gene expression signature for each cell type.
*   **Step 2: Deconvolution of Bulk TCGA/CPTAC Data:** We will employ and enhance machine learning-based deconvolution algorithms (e.g., CIBERSORTx, BayesPrism) to estimate the relative abundance and infer the cell-type-specific expression profiles for every cell type in each of the >11,000 TCGA tumors. This will transform the bulk data into a pseudo-multi-cellular dataset.
*   **Step 3: Integrating Spatial Constraints:** We will use the spatial transcriptomics data to build a probabilistic model of cell-cell co-occurrence. This model will learn which cell types are likely to be physically adjacent. This spatial prior will then be integrated into our deconvolution framework to refine the cell-type-specific expression profiles, making them spatially aware.

**Aim 3: Spatially-Resolved Community Metabolic Modeling and Simulation.**
This Aim will use the outputs from Aim 2 to construct and analyze predictive models of TME metabolism.
*   **Step 1: Contextualizing Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs):** We will use the inferred cell-type-specific gene and protein expression profiles to customize a human GEM (e.g., Recon3D). For each cell type in each tumor, we will use algorithms like GIMME or iMAT to generate a specific metabolic model that reflects its likely metabolic activity.
*   **Step 2: Assembling Multi-Cellular Community Models:** We will combine the individual cell-type GEMs into a single community model for each tumor. Critically, we will model the exchange of metabolites through a shared extracellular compartment. The maximum rate of exchange between any two cell types will be constrained by their estimated spatial proximity from Aim 2. This ensures that only adjacent cells can efficiently exchange metabolites, a key feature missing from previous models.
*   **Step 3: Simulation and Analysis:** We will use constraint-based methods, primarily Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), to simulate metabolic activity. We will set the objective function to maximize cancer cell proliferation while other cells perform ATP maintenance. By simulating thousands of these tumor-specific community models, we will identify common metabolic flux patterns, predict key metabolite exchanges, and perform in-silico knockout simulations to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities (choke points).

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete Aim 1 (data acquisition/harmonization). Develop and validate the deconvolution pipeline (Aim 2). Publish the pipeline as an open-source tool.
*   **Year 2:** Apply the pipeline to all TCGA cohorts. Construct and simulate community metabolic models for 5 priority cancer types (Aim 3). Develop beta version of the web portal.
*   **Year 3:** Complete simulations for all cohorts. Perform pan-cancer analysis to identify conserved vulnerabilities. Launch and publicize the final interactive web portal. Submit primary manuscripts.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to make transformative contributions to cancer biology, computational systems biology, and translational oncology. The outcomes will extend far beyond the immediate findings, providing the scientific community with new paradigms, tools, and resources that will catalyze future research. The collaborative, data-synthesis nature of this work directly addresses the core tenets of the NCEMS research call.

**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field:**
1.  **A Paradigm Shift in Cancer Metabolism:** The primary outcome will be a fundamental shift from a cell-centric view of tumor metabolism to a systems-level, ecological perspective. We will produce the first comprehensive, spatially-resolved atlas of metabolic symbiosis in the TME. This will reveal how system-level properties like aggressive growth and drug resistance emerge from local, multi-cellular interactions. This atlas will provide a foundational resource for understanding the metabolic principles that govern tumor progression.
2.  **Methodological Innovation in Computational Biology:** We will develop and disseminate a novel, open-source computational framework for the integrative analysis of bulk, single-cell, and spatial omics data. This spatially-aware deconvolution and metabolic modeling pipeline will be a significant methodological advance, applicable not only to cancer but to any complex, heterogeneous tissue (e.g., in neuroscience, immunology, or developmental biology). This addresses the call's goal to develop innovative analytical strategies.
3.  **Generation of Novel, Testable Hypotheses:** Our simulations will generate hundreds of specific, high-priority hypotheses about metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities in the TME. For example, we might hypothesize that a specific amino acid transporter on endothelial cells is essential for fueling cancer cell growth in glioblastoma. These data-driven hypotheses will provide a rich substrate for experimental validation by the broader research community, accelerating the pace of discovery.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
1.  **Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets:** By identifying conserved metabolic 'choke points' within the symbiotic network, this project will provide a rational basis for a new generation of cancer therapies. Targeting the metabolic support infrastructure of the tumor (e.g., stromal cell metabolism) rather than the genetically unstable cancer cell is a promising strategy to overcome acquired drug resistance. Our ranked list of vulnerabilities will be a valuable starting point for pharmaceutical development.
2.  **Development of a Community-Wide Resource:** A key deliverable is the creation of an open-access, interactive web portal. This portal will allow researchers worldwide, regardless of their computational expertise, to explore our results. A biologist could, for instance, query the predicted metabolic flux of their favorite gene in a specific cell type in breast cancer, or a clinician could explore the metabolic differences between responder and non-responder patient tumors. This resource will democratize access to complex data synthesis and significantly amplify the project's impact.
3.  **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** As mandated by the research call, this project is an ideal training vehicle. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work at the cutting edge of data science, cancer biology, and systems modeling. They will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary skills in large-scale data management, machine learning, and computational modeling, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy biomedical workforce.

**Dissemination and Open Science:**
Our commitment to open science is unwavering. All software developed will be released on GitHub with permissive open-source licenses. All processed data, models, and results will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare). We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals and present our work at major international conferences (e.g., AACR, ISMB, RECOMB). This multi-pronged approach ensures that our methods, data, and discoveries are immediately and broadly available, maximizing their utility and impact for the scientific community and the public.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project whose scope, complexity, and transdisciplinary nature far exceed the capabilities of a single research laboratory or existing collaboration.

Therefore, support from the NCEMS is essential for the success of this ambitious project.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:**
This project is uniquely suited for the NCEMS program. It is not a data generation project but a pure synthesis effort, leveraging vast public data repositories (TCGA, CPTAC, GEO).

ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_04,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,From Sequence to Interactome: Predicting Emergent Cellular Functions of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack a stable three-dimensional structure, represent a major puzzle in molecular biology. They are key players in cellular signaling and regulation, often functioning by forming dynamic, multivalent interactions that lead to the emergence of membraneless organelles through liquid-liquid phase separation. This project aims to create a predictive framework that can decipher the 'interaction grammar' of IDPs from their amino acid sequence alone. A transdisciplinary team of structural biologists, polymer physicists, bioinformaticians, and machine learning experts will integrate data from diverse public sources. We will leverage sequence and annotation data from DisProt, structural context from the PDB and AlphaFold DB, known interactions from BioGRID, and post-translational modification (PTM) data from proteomics repositories. The core of our project is to develop a novel deep learning model, inspired by large language models like BERT, that learns the sequence features, motifs, and PTM patterns that determine IDP binding specificity and phase separation propensity. This model will be trained on the integrated dataset to predict IDP interaction partners and the conditions under which they form condensates. The predictions will be used to parameterize polymer physics simulations to explore the emergent material properties of these condensates. This effort is beyond a single lab, requiring the fusion of AI development with deep biophysical and biological domain knowledge. The outcome will be a powerful, open-source tool to predict the functional consequences of mutations in disordered regions, which are frequently implicated in diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration. This will transform our ability to understand how the dynamic, fuzzy interactions of IDPs give rise to the highly organized, emergent behavior of the cell.",,"Background And Significance

The central dogma of molecular biology, for decades, was dominated by the sequence-structure-function paradigm, where a protein's function was inextricably linked to a unique, stable three-dimensional structure. However, the sequencing of eukaryotic genomes revealed a startling reality: a significant fraction of proteomes, over 30% in humans, consists of proteins or regions that lack a fixed structure under physiological conditions. These intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) challenged classical structural biology and were initially dismissed as biological noise. We now understand that this conformational heterogeneity is not a bug but a feature, enabling a vast range of functions that are inaccessible to structured proteins. IDPs are central hubs in cellular interaction networks, mediating signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin remodeling. Their functional advantage lies in their ability to form dynamic, multivalent, and often transient interactions, creating what has been termed 'fuzzy' complexes. This dynamic binding allows them to act as scaffolds, sensors, and regulators, integrating multiple cellular signals. A key emergent phenomenon driven by IDPs is liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a thermodynamic process where multivalent interactions among IDPs and RNA drive their demixing from the cytoplasm to form membraneless organelles (MLOs). These biomolecular condensates, such as nucleoli, stress granules, and P-bodies, are dynamic compartments that concentrate specific molecules to enhance reaction rates, sequester components, and organize the cellular landscape. The physical principles governing LLPS are rooted in polymer physics, where IDPs are treated as associative polymers. The 'stickers-and-spacers' model provides a conceptual framework, where 'stickers' (e.g., aromatic or charged residues) mediate specific interactions, and flexible 'spacers' determine the polymer's conformational properties and the phase behavior of the system. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation act as a crucial regulatory layer, altering the 'stickiness' of these motifs and dynamically tuning the formation and dissolution of condensates in response to cellular cues. The importance of IDPs is underscored by their profound link to human disease. The misregulation of IDP interactions or their aberrant phase transitions into irreversible, solid-like aggregates are hallmarks of numerous pathologies. For instance, the hyperphosphorylation of the IDP Tau is linked to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, while mutations in the disordered regions of FUS and TDP-43 promote their aggregation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In oncology, oncogenic IDPs like c-Myc and p53 are master regulators whose disordered regions are critical for their function and dysregulation in cancer. Despite this progress, a fundamental gap persists in our understanding: we lack a predictive framework that can translate the primary amino acid sequence of an IDP into its functional interactome and emergent phase behavior. Current computational tools are fragmented. Some predictors, like IUPred2A or PONDR, can identify disordered regions with reasonable accuracy. Others, such as those searching for short linear motifs (SLiMs), can predict potential binding sites but often suffer from high false-positive rates and lack context. Similarly, algorithms like FuzDrop and PSPredictor estimate LLPS propensity based on general sequence features but cannot predict specific interaction partners or the material properties of the resulting condensates. This fragmentation prevents a holistic understanding of how sequence encodes function. The time is ripe to address this challenge. We are at a unique confluence of massive, publicly available biological data—from genomic and proteomic sequences (UniProt), curated disorder annotations (DisProt), interaction networks (BioGRID), structural snapshots (PDB, AlphaFold DB), and PTM atlases (PhosphoSitePlus)—and revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning models like transformers. These models have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to learn context and long-range dependencies in sequential data, as exemplified by AlphaFold2's success in protein structure prediction. By synthesizing these vast datasets through a purpose-built deep learning architecture, we can begin to decipher the 'interaction grammar' of IDPs, creating a unified model that bridges the scales from sequence to emergent cellular function.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is driven by a central, overarching goal: to develop a computational framework that can predict the emergent functional landscape of an intrinsically disordered protein directly from its amino acid sequence. To achieve this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses that will guide our data synthesis and modeling efforts. Our approach is designed to move beyond simple classification (e.g., disordered/ordered) towards a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of IDP function.

**Research Question 1: Can a unified 'interaction grammar' be learned from IDP sequences to accurately predict specific binding partners and the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs)?**
This question addresses the fundamental challenge of mapping sequence to specific molecular interactions. While we know certain motifs are important, we hypothesize that the context in which these motifs appear, including flanking sequences, global amino acid composition, and PTM status, is critical for determining binding specificity.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A multi-modal deep learning model, trained on integrated data encompassing protein sequences, known interactions, structural contexts, and PTM sites, can learn the complex sequence features that govern IDP binding specificity with significantly higher fidelity than current motif-based or co-expression-based methods.
*   **Prediction:** Our model, which we term 'IDP-BERT', will be able to distinguish true interaction partners from non-partners in a held-out test set with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) greater than 0.85. Furthermore, the model's attention mechanisms will highlight specific residues and regions ('stickers') critical for binding, recapitulating known short linear motifs (SLiMs) and discovering novel ones.
*   **Validation:** We will validate predictions against a manually curated benchmark dataset of high-confidence, experimentally verified IDP interactions not included in the training data. We will perform *in silico* saturation mutagenesis on well-characterized IDP interaction pairs (e.g., p53-MDM2) to test if our model correctly predicts the loss or gain of function associated with known mutations.

**Research Question 2: How do sequence-encoded features and PTMs collectively determine an IDP's propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form biomolecular condensates?**
This question links molecular interactions to the next level of organization: the formation of mesoscale assemblies. We posit that the same sequence grammar that dictates one-on-one interactions also governs the multivalent interactions driving LLPS.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** The features learned by IDP-BERT for specific binding can be leveraged in a multi-task learning framework to predict a protein's intrinsic propensity to phase separate. The model will learn how the distribution, type, and PTM-state of 'stickers' across the sequence collectively determine the valency and interaction strength required for LLPS.
*   **Prediction:** The model will accurately classify proteins from curated LLPS databases (e.g., PhaSepDB) with high precision and recall. It will also predict the direction of change in LLPS propensity upon specific PTMs, such as predicting that phosphorylation of FUS's low-complexity domain will decrease its tendency to phase separate, consistent with experimental observations.
*   **Validation:** We will systematically compare our model's LLPS propensity scores against experimental data from the literature, including saturation concentrations and phase diagrams for a set of well-studied proteins (e.g., FUS, TDP-43, LAF-1). We will also test its ability to predict the effects of known ALS-associated mutations on the phase behavior of FUS.

**Research Question 3: Can sequence-level predictions be systematically bridged to predict the emergent, physical material properties of IDP-driven condensates?**
This is the most ambitious question, aiming to connect our predictive model to the principles of polymer physics to understand the emergent behavior of the cell. The 'fuzziness' of IDP interactions leads to condensates with diverse material states, from dynamic liquids to viscous gels, and we hypothesize this is predictable.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The interaction probabilities and binding site locations predicted by IDP-BERT can be directly translated into effective interaction parameters for coarse-grained molecular simulations, enabling the prediction of mesoscale properties like condensate viscosity, surface tension, and internal component dynamics.
*   **Prediction:** Simulations parameterized by our model will recapitulate known differences in material properties between different MLOs. For example, simulations of P-granule components will yield condensates with higher fluidity (lower viscosity) than simulations of stress granule components.
*   **Validation:** We will compare quantitative outputs from our simulations (e.g., diffusion coefficients, droplet fusion timescales) with experimental measurements from public datasets and literature, such as data from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We will validate that our simulation pipeline can reproduce the experimentally observed impact of changing salt concentration or temperature on condensate stability.

**Expected Deliverables:** The project will yield: (1) A publicly available, integrated, and version-controlled database of IDP features. (2) The open-source code for the IDP-BERT model and all training pipelines. (3) A user-friendly web server for the community to analyze their proteins of interest. (4) A validated pipeline for parameterizing coarse-grained simulations from model outputs.

Methods And Approach

Our research plan is structured into three synergistic aims that integrate data curation, machine learning model development, and biophysical simulation. This transdisciplinary approach is essential to bridge the scales from primary sequence to emergent cellular function. The entire project will adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles for data and open science practices for software.

**Aim 1: Assemble a Large-Scale, Multi-Modal Integrated Data Resource for IDP Function.**
This foundational aim focuses on aggregating and harmonizing diverse public datasets into a unified resource suitable for training a sophisticated deep learning model. This task requires significant bioinformatic expertise and is critical for the project's success.
*   **Data Sources:** We will synthesize data from a comprehensive list of public repositories. 
    *   **Sequence and Disorder Annotations:** Protein sequences will be sourced from UniProt (Swiss-Prot). Experimentally validated disordered regions will be extracted from DisProt and MobiDB. Computationally predicted disorder scores from multiple algorithms (e.g., IUPred2A, Espritz) will be included as input features.
    *   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** High-confidence physical interactions will be aggregated from BioGRID, IntAct, and STRING. We will use stringent filtering criteria, retaining only interactions supported by at least two independent experiments or those from manually curated datasets to minimize noise.
    *   **Structural Context:** For IDPs that form complexes with structured proteins, we will extract atomic coordinates from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For all proteins, we will use the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database to obtain high-quality structural models of any folded domains flanking or embedded within IDRs.
    *   **Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs):** Experimentally verified PTM sites (e.g., phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation) will be sourced from PhosphoSitePlus, dbPTM, and recent large-scale proteomics studies. We will map these sites precisely onto our canonical UniProt sequences.
    *   **Phase Separation Data:** A ground-truth dataset of phase-separating proteins will be compiled from specialized databases like PhaSepDB, DrLLPS, and PhaSePro, along with manual curation from the literature.
*   **Data Integration and Preprocessing:** A robust pipeline using Python (Biopython, Pandas) and custom scripts will be developed to process and integrate these data. All entries will be mapped to unique UniProtKB identifiers. The final integrated dataset will be structured as a graph, where nodes represent proteins and their attributes (sequence, disorder, PTMs) and edges represent interactions. This resource will be version-controlled and made publicly available via Zenodo.

**Aim 2: Develop, Train, and Validate 'IDP-BERT', a Transformer-Based Model for Predicting IDP Interactomes and Phase Behavior.**
This aim constitutes the core computational modeling effort of the project.
*   **Model Architecture:** We will build upon the Transformer architecture, which has proven highly effective for sequential data. Our model, 'IDP-BERT', will take a protein's amino acid sequence as input. We will develop a custom tokenization scheme that represents not only the 20 standard amino acids but also incorporates information about PTMs at specific sites. This allows the model to learn how modifications like phosphorylation alter the 'meaning' of a sequence.
*   **Training Strategy:** We will employ a two-stage training process.
    1.  **Self-Supervised Pre-training:** The model will first be pre-trained on the entire human proteome from UniProt. Using a masked language model objective, it will learn the fundamental statistical patterns and long-range dependencies inherent in protein sequences, creating powerful, context-aware embeddings for each amino acid.
    2.  **Supervised Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model will then be fine-tuned on our integrated dataset from Aim 1 using a multi-task learning approach. The model will have multiple output 'heads', each trained for a specific task: a) an **Interaction Head** that predicts the probability of interaction between two proteins; b) an **LLPS Head** that predicts the propensity of a single protein to phase separate; and c) a **Binding Site Head** that predicts which specific residues are likely to mediate interactions. This multi-task setup allows the model to learn a shared representation that captures the underlying principles common to both specific binding and multivalent phase separation.
*   **Validation and Interpretation:** The model will be rigorously validated using k-fold cross-validation and on held-out test sets. We will analyze the model's internal attention weights to interpret its predictions, identifying the sequence motifs and long-range contacts it deems important. This will provide novel biological insights into the 'rules' of IDP interactions.

**Aim 3: Bridge Sequence-Level Predictions to Mesoscale Simulations of Condensate Material Properties.**
This aim connects the machine learning predictions to physical models to explore emergent properties.
*   **Simulation Parameterization:** We will develop a pipeline to translate the outputs of IDP-BERT into parameters for coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations. The predicted interaction probabilities between different sequence regions ('stickers') will be converted into effective pairwise interaction energies in a CG model (e.g., a 'stickers-and-spacers' representation).
*   **Simulation Engine:** We will utilize highly efficient, open-source simulation packages designed for polymer physics and phase separation, such as LaSSI or HOOMD-blue, running on GPU-accelerated hardware.
*   **Analysis of Emergent Properties:** We will run large-scale simulations of single- and multi-component systems to predict phase diagrams as a function of protein concentration and other variables. By analyzing the simulation trajectories, we will calculate key material properties, including condensate density, surface tension, and viscosity (via Green-Kubo relations), and the diffusion rates of molecules within the condensate.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Completion of the integrated data resource (M6). Development and pre-training of the first IDP-BERT prototype (M9). Initial fine-tuning and validation for PPI prediction (M12).
*   **Year 2:** Full multi-task model development, including LLPS and PTM effects (M18). Establishment of the simulation parameterization pipeline (M21). First comparative simulations of different IDP systems (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Rigorous validation of the full model and simulation pipeline against experimental data (M30). Development and deployment of the public web server (M33). Submission of manuscripts and release of all data and software (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of molecular and cellular biology, biophysics, and computational biology. By creating a unified predictive framework for IDP function, we will move the field from a descriptive to a predictive science, enabling researchers to generate and test hypotheses about the complex organizational principles of the cell. The impact will be felt across basic science, translational medicine, and biotechnology.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A Unified Predictive Tool for IDP Function:** The primary outcome will be 'IDP-BERT', a powerful, open-source computational tool and web server. For the first time, researchers will be able to input an amino acid sequence and receive a comprehensive functional prediction, including likely interaction partners, propensity for phase separation, key functional sites, and the probable impact of PTMs. This will democratize the study of IDPs, making sophisticated computational analysis accessible to the entire biological community.
2.  **Deciphering the 'Molecular Grammar' of IDPs:** Our work will provide fundamental insights into the sequence-encoded rules that govern IDP interactions. By interpreting the features learned by our model, we expect to discover novel interaction motifs (SLiMs) and uncover the complex interplay between local motifs and global sequence context. This will provide a new 'dictionary' for understanding how information is encoded in the disordered proteome.
3.  **A Quantitative Bridge Between Sequence and Mesoscale Physics:** The project will establish a novel, validated workflow for connecting sequence-level information to the emergent material properties of biomolecular condensates. This will provide a powerful *in silico* microscope to explore how mutations or PTMs alter the liquidity, viscosity, and dynamics of membraneless organelles, offering mechanistic explanations for their function and dysfunction.
4.  **A Rich, Integrated Data Resource:** The curated, multimodal dataset assembled in Aim 1 will be a valuable community resource in its own right. By harmonizing data from disparate sources, we will provide a high-quality, benchmark dataset that can be used by other groups to develop and test new computational methods.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Translational Medicine and Disease:** The ability to predict the functional consequences of mutations in disordered regions has profound clinical implications. Our tool can be used to rapidly assess the pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance (VUS) found in patient genomes, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., ALS, Alzheimer's) and cancers where IDPs are frequently mutated. This can accelerate diagnostics and guide the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating IDP interactions or phase behavior.
*   **Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** A predictive understanding of IDP grammar will empower the rational design of novel proteins. Engineers will be able to design synthetic IDPs with bespoke interaction partners and phase separation properties to create artificial cellular compartments, novel biosensors, or therapeutic proteins with precisely tuned behaviors.
*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is an ideal training vehicle for the next generation of data-savvy bioscientists. Graduate students and postdocs will work at the cutting edge of machine learning, biophysics, and cell biology, acquiring a uniquely transdisciplinary skillset that is in high demand. Through workshops and collaborative coding sessions, we will foster a team-oriented and open-science research culture.

**Dissemination Plan and Open Science Commitment:**
We are fully committed to open science principles. All software will be developed under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT) and hosted on GitHub. The trained models and the integrated dataset will be deposited in public repositories like Zenodo and Model Zoo. We will develop a user-friendly web server to ensure broad accessibility of our predictive tool. Our findings will be disseminated through high-impact, open-access publications in journals such as *Nature Methods*, *Cell Systems*, or *PNAS*, and through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ISMB, ASCB, BPS). We will also organize a workshop in the final year to train other researchers in the use of our tools and methods.

**Long-Term Vision:** This project lays the groundwork for a long-term vision of creating a 'virtual cell' where the emergent organization of the cytoplasm can be predicted from genomic information. Future iterations could incorporate cellular localization data, RNA interactions, and metabolic information to build an increasingly comprehensive model of cellular life. This work will fundamentally change our ability to interpret genomes, moving from a list of parts to a dynamic blueprint of the living cell.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:** The ambitious scale of this project—integrating vast, heterogeneous datasets, developing a novel deep learning architecture, and coupling it with advanced biophysical simulations—requires a critical mass of diverse expertise that no single lab possesses. The NCEMS framework is essential for assembling and supporting this 'dream team' of scientists and providing the collaborative environment needed to tackle this fundamental question in cellular emergence.",,
ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_05,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Deep Homology of Gene Regulatory Networks: Uncovering the Emergent Logic of Multicellularity,"The evolution of complex multicellularity occurred independently multiple times across the tree of life, presenting a profound puzzle: are there universal design principles governing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that orchestrate this transition? This project proposes to answer this question by performing the first large-scale comparative analysis of GRNs from a wide phylogenetic range of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Our working group will unite evolutionary biologists, developmental biologists, network scientists, and computational biologists to synthesize a massive collection of public genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data (e.g., from NCBI, ENCODE, and single-cell developmental atlases). We will develop a standardized computational pipeline to reconstruct GRNs for dozens of species, from choanoflagellates and fungi to plants and animals. Using tools from network theory, information theory, and topological data analysis, we will compare these networks to identify conserved architectural features, motifs, and dynamic properties associated with the emergence of multicellular life. We will test specific hypotheses, such as whether the evolution of multicellularity is consistently preceded by an expansion of transcription factor families or the appearance of specific network motifs that enable robust cell differentiation. This community-scale synthesis is essential because it requires a vast amount of data processing and a unique combination of expertise in evolutionary theory and computational network analysis. The project will yield fundamental insights into the 'syntactical' rules that allow simple genetic toolkits to generate the emergent complexity of a multicellular organism. We will create a public 'GRN-Zoo' database and visualization platform, providing a foundational resource for the community and training young scientists in the principles of evolutionary systems biology.",,"Background And Significance

The emergence of complex multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors is one of the most profound and consequential transitions in the history of life. This evolutionary leap, which occurred independently in at least six eukaryotic lineages including animals, plants, and fungi, enabled the evolution of macroscopic life and the vast ecological complexity we observe today. A central, unanswered question in biology is whether these independent origins of multicellularity followed convergent evolutionary paths governed by universal principles. While the specific genes and proteins involved—the 'hardware'—differ between lineages, we hypothesize that the underlying 'software'—the logic and architecture of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control cell differentiation, communication, and spatial organization—may exhibit deep homologies or convergent features. Understanding this regulatory grammar is fundamental to explaining how emergent complexity arises from a finite set of genetic components. 

Current research, largely from the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), has provided critical foundational insights. Studies on the unicellular relatives of animals, such as choanoflagellates, have revealed that a significant portion of the 'developmental toolkit' genes—including transcription factors, signaling pathway components, and adhesion molecules—were already present in their single-celled ancestors (King et al., 2008; Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2017). This seminal discovery shifted the focus from the origin of new genes to the rewiring of pre-existing regulatory connections as the primary driver of multicellular innovation. Similarly, comparative genomics in plants and fungi has shown that unicellular algae and fungi possess orthologs of key regulators of multicellular development (e.g., MADS-box genes in plants). These findings strongly imply that the transition to multicellularity was primarily a problem of information processing and network engineering.

Systems biology has provided the conceptual framework for studying GRNs as complex networks. Detailed GRN models have been painstakingly constructed for specific developmental processes in model organisms like the sea urchin endomesoderm (Davidson et al., 2002) and Drosophila segmentation (Jaeger et al., 2004). These studies demonstrate how network architecture gives rise to precise spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and robust developmental outcomes. However, these efforts have been largely confined to single species or closely related groups, providing limited insight into the macroevolutionary patterns of GRN evolution across deep time.

This leaves a critical gap in our knowledge. We lack a systematic, cross-kingdom comparative analysis of GRNs. Previous comparative studies have been limited in phylogenetic scope or have focused on the evolution of individual transcription factors or small motifs rather than whole-network architectures. Furthermore, the methods used to infer GRNs are diverse and often not directly comparable, creating a methodological fragmentation that has prevented a unified synthesis. The sheer scale of the data required—integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics from dozens of species—and the analytical complexity of comparing large, heterogeneous networks have placed such a project beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory. 

This project is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the explosion of publicly available data, including hundreds of high-quality genomes and vast repositories of transcriptomic (e.g., SRA, GEO) and epigenomic (e.g., ENCODE) data, makes a large-scale synthesis project feasible for the first time. The recent advent of single-cell atlases provides unprecedented resolution into the cell-type-specific regulatory states that define multicellularity. Second, advances in computational biology, including machine learning algorithms for network inference and novel analytical tools from network science and topological data analysis, provide the necessary power to extract meaningful patterns from this data deluge. By uniting a multidisciplinary team of experts to tackle this challenge, we can move beyond species-specific descriptions to uncover the fundamental, and potentially universal, principles of regulatory logic that enabled one of life's greatest innovations.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is guided by the overarching question: Are there universal architectural principles and dynamic properties of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) that convergently evolved to enable the transition from unicellular to complex multicellular life? To deconstruct this central question, we have formulated four specific, interconnected research questions (RQs), each associated with a set of testable hypotheses and clear, falsifiable predictions.

**RQ1: How did the global architecture and topology of GRNs change during the transition to multicellularity?**
This question addresses the macro-level structural changes in GRNs. We hypothesize that the demands of coordinating multiple cell types in a stable body plan imposed strong selection for more complex and organized network structures.
*   **Hypothesis 1 (The Hierarchy and Modularity Hypothesis):** The evolution of multicellularity is consistently associated with an increase in both the hierarchical organization and modularity of GRNs.
    *   *Prediction 1a:* Using network metrics, we will find that GRNs from multicellular organisms exhibit significantly higher global reaching centrality and a more layered, acyclic structure compared to their unicellular sister taxa. This reflects the emergence of master regulators controlling downstream developmental cascades.
    *   *Prediction 1b:* We predict that multicellular GRNs will have a higher modularity score, with identified modules corresponding to distinct cell-type-specific or tissue-specific developmental programs. We will test this by assessing the functional enrichment (GO terms) of genes within computationally defined network modules.

**RQ2: Are specific, functional network motifs convergently acquired or enriched in independent multicellular lineages?**
This question focuses on the micro-level circuitry of GRNs. We posit that certain computational tasks essential for multicellularity, such as robust cell fate decisions and noise filtering, are solved by a limited set of optimal network motifs.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (The Convergent Motif Hypothesis):** Network motifs that function as bistable switches, oscillators, and noise-dampening filters are significantly and convergently enriched in the GRNs of multicellular organisms.
    *   *Prediction 2a:* A systematic search will reveal a statistically significant over-representation of motifs like the toggle switch (two mutually repressing genes) and the coherent feed-forward loop (FFL) in all analyzed multicellular lineages (animals, plants, fungi) relative to their unicellular relatives.
    *   *Prediction 2b:* The genes participating in these enriched motifs will be disproportionately involved in cell fate specification, cell cycle control, and intercellular signaling pathways, as determined by functional annotation.

**RQ3: How do the potential dynamic properties of GRNs differ between unicellular and multicellular organisms?**
This question moves from static network structure to the functional consequences for cellular behavior. We hypothesize that multicellular GRNs are structured to support a larger and more stable repertoire of cellular states.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (The Expanded Attractor Landscape Hypothesis):** GRNs from multicellular organisms possess a richer landscape of stable states (attractors), corresponding to distinct cell types, compared to the simpler landscapes of their unicellular ancestors.
    *   *Prediction 3a:* Using Boolean network modeling on core regulatory sub-networks, we will find that multicellular GRNs have a significantly larger number of stable point attractors and stable cyclic attractors than unicellular GRNs.
    *   *Prediction 3b:* The attractors identified in our models will correspond to known cell-type-specific gene expression profiles derived from single-cell RNA-seq data, validating their biological relevance. The transitions between these attractors will require specific input signals, mirroring developmental signaling pathways.

**RQ4: What are the genomic and epigenomic correlates of the evolutionary transition to multicellular GRN architectures?**
This question links network evolution to changes in the genome itself. We propose that network rewiring is scaffolded by specific changes in the genetic toolkit and the regulatory landscape.
*   **Hypothesis 4 (The Regulatory Scaffolding Hypothesis):** The emergence of complex multicellular GRNs is preceded or accompanied by the expansion of specific transcription factor (TF) families and an increase in the complexity of the cis-regulatory landscape.
    *   *Prediction 4a:* Phylogenetic analysis will show that major expansions of lineage-specific TF families (e.g., bHLH, Homeobox in animals; MADS-box in plants) correlate tightly with the phylogenetic nodes where multicellularity arose.
    *   *Prediction 4b:* These expanded TF families will be identified as key hub nodes in the multicellular GRNs. Furthermore, we predict a significant increase in the density of conserved non-coding elements (potential cis-regulatory sites) and regions of open chromatin (from ATAC-seq data) in the genomes of multicellular organisms compared to their unicellular relatives.

Methods And Approach

This project will be executed in four integrated phases by a transdisciplinary working group with expertise spanning evolutionary biology, network science, computational biology, and data science. Our approach is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and open, leveraging only publicly available data as stipulated by the research call.

**Phase 1: Community-Scale Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**
This foundational phase addresses the critical challenge of integrating vast and heterogeneous public datasets.
*   **Species Selection:** We will select a phylogenetically balanced set of approximately 50 species, capturing at least five independent origins of multicellularity (Metazoa, Land Plants, Florideophyte red algae, and two fungal lineages). For each origin, we will sample a triad of species: a unicellular outgroup, a simple multicellular relative, and a complex multicellular organism (e.g., *Monosiga brevicollis* -> *Amphimedon queenslandica* -> *Drosophila melanogaster*). This comparative phylogenetic framework is essential for inferring the direction of evolutionary change.
*   **Data Aggregation:** We will systematically mine major public repositories, including NCBI (genomes, SRA), EBI (ArrayExpress, Expression Atlas), and ENCODE/modENCODE. We will prioritize species with high-quality genome assemblies, annotations, and extensive transcriptomic (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq for histone marks) data.
*   **Standardized Processing Pipeline:** To ensure comparability across species, all raw data will be processed through a single, harmonized pipeline. This pipeline, built using Nextflow for scalability and portability, and containerized with Docker/Singularity for reproducibility, will perform tasks such as: uniform quality control of sequencing reads, mapping to reference genomes, transcript quantification (e.g., Salmon), and peak calling for epigenomic data (e.g., MACS2). All processed data and metadata will be stored in a centralized, versioned repository.

**Phase 2: Multi-Modal Gene Regulatory Network Inference (Months 6-18)**
Recognizing that no single GRN inference algorithm is infallible, we will employ an ensemble, integrative approach to generate a consensus, high-confidence network for each species.
*   **Inference Methods:** Our pipeline will integrate three distinct lines of evidence:
    1.  **Expression-based inference:** We will use mutual information-based methods (e.g., ARACNe, GENIE3) and Bayesian network models to infer regulatory relationships from large compilations of gene expression data.
    2.  **Sequence-based inference:** We will perform genome-wide scans for transcription factor binding motifs (using databases like JASPAR and CIS-BP) in promoter and enhancer regions (identified via chromatin accessibility data) to predict physical TF-target gene interactions.
    3.  **Chromatin-based inference:** We will leverage ATAC-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq data to identify active regulatory elements and link them to target genes based on proximity and chromatin conformation data (where available), thus refining the set of potential regulatory interactions.
*   **Network Integration and Validation:** The outputs of these methods will be integrated using a weighted scoring scheme to produce a final, confidence-scored GRN for each species. The pipeline's performance and scoring thresholds will be calibrated by benchmarking against gold-standard, experimentally validated GRNs from model organisms like *E. coli*, *S. cerevisiae*, and *D. melanogaster*.

**Phase 3: Comparative Network Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Months 15-30)**
This phase constitutes the core scientific inquiry of the project.
*   **Topological Analysis (RQ1, H1):** We will compute a suite of global and local network metrics for all 50 GRNs using libraries like NetworkX and igraph. We will use Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) to test for statistically significant correlations between network properties (e.g., modularity, hierarchy) and the presence of multicellularity, while controlling for phylogenetic non-independence.
*   **Motif Analysis (RQ2, H2):** We will use specialized algorithms (e.g., FANMOD) to determine the statistical significance (Z-score) of all 3- and 4-node motifs in each network compared to a null model. We will then compare motif significance profiles across the phylogenetic tree to identify convergently enriched motifs.
*   **Dynamical Modeling (RQ3, H3):** For key sub-networks involved in cell fate decisions, we will construct and analyze Boolean network models. By simulating the network dynamics, we will identify the number and characteristics of their attractors (stable states). We will test if the number of attractors correlates with the number of cell types in the organism.
*   **Innovative Approaches:** We will employ Topological Data Analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology, to capture higher-order structural features of the GRNs. This novel approach may reveal complex organizational principles (e.g., loops, voids in network space) that are invisible to standard metrics and may be signatures of multicellularity.

**Phase 4: Resource Dissemination and Community Training (Months 24-36)**
*   **The GRN-Zoo:** We will develop and launch a public, web-accessible database, the 'GRN-Zoo'. This resource will feature an intuitive interface for browsing, searching, visualizing (using Cytoscape.js), and downloading all inferred GRNs, associated metadata, and analysis results. It will serve as a lasting contribution to the scientific community.
*   **Open Science Commitment:** All analysis scripts, workflows, and pipelines will be open-source and available on GitHub. All data products will be deposited in public repositories like Zenodo. We will publish our findings in open-access journals.
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   Year 1: Data curation for all species complete. GRN inference pipeline v1.0 deployed. Pilot GRNs for 10 species reconstructed and analyzed.
    *   Year 2: All 50 GRNs reconstructed. Comparative analysis framework finalized. GRN-Zoo beta version launched. First major manuscript submitted.
    *   Year 3: In-depth hypothesis testing, including dynamical modeling and TDA, completed. GRN-Zoo public release with full functionality. Final manuscripts submitted. Host first community training workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This community-scale synthesis project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes, significantly advancing the fields of evolutionary, developmental, and systems biology. The impact will be felt through the generation of fundamental new knowledge, the creation of a lasting community resource, the development of novel analytical strategies, and the training of a new generation of data-savvy biologists.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **Discovery of Universal Principles of Biological Emergence:** The primary intellectual contribution will be the identification of a core set of principles—a 'regulatory grammar'—that govern the evolution of multicellularity. By moving beyond the specifics of individual lineages, we aim to uncover the convergent logic that enables the emergence of complex biological form and function. This would represent a major step towards a predictive theory of developmental evolution and would directly address the funding call's focus on emergence phenomena.
2.  **A Foundational Community Resource: The GRN-Zoo:** We will deliver the first large-scale, cross-kingdom comparative atlas of gene regulatory networks. The 'GRN-Zoo' database and visualization platform will be a durable resource for the entire biological community, analogous to how GenBank or the Protein Data Bank have catalyzed research. It will empower countless new investigations by enabling researchers to easily query and compare regulatory architectures across the tree of life, ask new questions, and formulate novel hypotheses.
3.  **Methodological Advancement and Standardization:** Our project will produce and disseminate a robust, reproducible, and open-source computational pipeline for integrating diverse 'omics' data to infer and compare GRNs. This standardized framework will help overcome the methodological fragmentation in the field, promoting higher standards of rigor and comparability in future systems biology research.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Informing Synthetic Biology:** The design principles we uncover will provide a blueprint for the forward engineering of synthetic multicellular systems. Understanding how nature builds robust, complex systems can guide the creation of engineered tissues for regenerative medicine, programmable microbial consortia for bioremediation, and sophisticated cellular circuits for bioproduction.
*   **New Perspectives on Disease:** Many human diseases, most notably cancer, can be conceptualized as a breakdown of the regulatory programs that maintain multicellular cooperation. Cancer cells often reactivate ancestral unicellular behaviors like proliferation and migration. Our research into the GRNs that stabilize multicellularity could reveal network-level vulnerabilities and identify novel therapeutic targets aimed at reinforcing the 'multicellular contract'.
*   **Advancing STEM Education and Training:** This project is intrinsically multidisciplinary and will serve as an exceptional training environment. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will gain unique expertise at the intersection of evolutionary biology, computational science, and network theory. Through our planned annual workshops, we will disseminate these skills to the broader community, directly contributing to the development of the future data-savvy workforce as mandated by the research call.

**Dissemination Plan and Long-Term Vision:**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-faceted. We will publish our primary findings in high-impact, open-access journals such as *Nature*, *Science*, or *Cell*, with more specialized methodological and analytical papers submitted to journals like *PLoS Computational Biology* and *Molecular Biology and Evolution*. We will actively present our work at major international conferences (e.g., ISMB, SMBE, SDB) to engage with the community. The GRN-Zoo will be the central hub for dissemination, providing open access to all data and results. Our long-term vision is for the GRN-Zoo to become a living database, sustained by follow-on funding and community contributions. The working group established by this project will form the nucleus of a durable collaborative network, fostering future projects that build upon this foundational work to incorporate new data types like spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, further unraveling the emergent logic of life.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of a single research lab or a standard collaborative grant. The immense scale of data aggregation and processing across ~50 species, the development of a sophisticated and robust computational pipeline, the deep, multidisciplinary expertise required for analysis, and the creation of a lasting public resource (the GRN-Zoo) necessitate the support and structure provided by the NCEMS Working Group program. This project requires a dedicated team of specialists in evolutionary genomics, developmental biology, network science, computer science, and statistics to work in a deeply integrated fashion over three years, a mode of collaboration that this funding mechanism is uniquely designed to foster.

**Budget Justification (Total Request: $1,450,000 over 3 years)**

*   **A. Personnel ($945,000 - 65%):** The bulk of the budget is allocated to personnel who will drive the project's day-to-day research and development.
    *   **Postdoctoral Fellows (3):** $225,000 (3 x $75,000/yr avg salary+fringe). Three postdocs will form the core research team.

Current approaches are often piecemeal. We propose to build 'CellStateNet,' a foundational AI model for molecular and cellular biology, trained on the entirety of public perturbation-response data. This project will assemble a team of machine learning experts, systems biologists, and pharmacologists to tackle this ambitious goal. The working group will aggregate and harmonize massive datasets, including transcriptomic data from LINCS L1000 and GEO, genetic dependency maps from DepMap and Achilles, and proteomic perturbation data from CPTAC. The core technical innovation will be the development of a multi-modal, self-supervised deep learning architecture that learns a unified, latent representation of cellular state. This model will be trained to predict the outcome of one data modality (e.g., proteomics) from another (e.g., transcriptomics) under a given perturbation. Once trained, CellStateNet will function as a powerful in-silico laboratory. It will be used to predict the effects of novel drug combinations, forecast the phenotypic consequences of uncharacterized genetic variants, and identify synergistic therapeutic strategies. The emergent cellular phenotype is a complex output of the underlying molecular network; our model aims to learn this mapping directly from data at an unprecedented scale. The sheer volume of data and the complexity of the required AI models make this project intractable for a single research group. The resulting pre-trained model, along with all associated code and training pipelines, will be made publicly available, empowering the broader research community to address a vast range of biological questions and accelerating the pace of therapeutic discovery.",,"Background And Significance

The living cell is a quintessential complex adaptive system. Its state is defined by an intricate, multi-layered network of interactions between genes, proteins, and other molecules. The response of this system to perturbations—be it a therapeutic drug, a disease-causing mutation, or an environmental stressor—is an emergent phenomenon that is notoriously difficult to predict. This predictive challenge represents a fundamental bottleneck in virtually every aspect of modern biology and medicine, from designing effective cancer therapies to understanding the mechanisms of genetic disorders. For decades, the dominant paradigm for studying cellular responses has been reductionist, focusing on individual pathways or a handful of molecules. While invaluable, this approach struggles to capture the system-level properties that govern cellular behavior. The advent of high-throughput omics technologies has enabled a more holistic view, generating vast datasets that profile cellular states at unprecedented resolution. Landmark public resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS L1000), the Dependency Map (DepMap), and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) now house millions of molecular profiles of cells under a wide array of chemical and genetic perturbations. These datasets represent a monumental community achievement and an unparalleled resource for understanding cellular logic. However, they remain largely fragmented and underutilized. Current computational approaches to model this data are often limited in scope. Mechanistic models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can provide deep insights but are restricted to well-characterized pathways and do not scale to the genome level. Conversely, statistical and machine learning models have shown promise in specific tasks, such as predicting drug sensitivity from baseline gene expression. Yet, these models are typically trained on a single data modality for a single predictive task (e.g., predicting cell viability). They often lack generalizability across different cell types, perturbation classes, or molecular readouts. A key gap in the field is the absence of a unified framework that can integrate these disparate, multi-modal datasets to learn a general, transferable model of cellular response. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly the development of 'foundational models' in natural language processing (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) and computer vision, offer a new paradigm. These models are pre-trained on massive, diverse datasets using self-supervised objectives and learn powerful, general-purpose representations that can be adapted to a multitude of downstream tasks. The application of this paradigm to molecular and cellular biology is both timely and transformative. Early efforts have demonstrated the potential of deep learning to predict single-cell transcriptomic responses to perturbations (Lotfollahi et al., 2022), but these have been limited to a single data modality and a narrow set of perturbations. This project, CellStateNet, proposes to take a quantum leap forward. We will be the first to construct a true foundational model for cellular biology by integrating the world's public perturbation-response data across transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional genomics. The importance of this research cannot be overstated. Such a model would function as a universal 'in-silico cell,' allowing researchers to perform virtual experiments at a scale and speed unattainable in the laboratory. It would enable the systematic exploration of the vast combinatorial space of drug mixtures, the functional interpretation of uncharacterized genetic variants, and the deconvolution of complex disease mechanisms. The sheer scale of the data integration effort, the computational complexity of training a multi-modal foundational model, and the transdisciplinary expertise required—spanning machine learning, bioinformatics, systems biology, and pharmacology—place this project far beyond the capacity of any single research lab. It is precisely the type of community-scale synthesis project that this research call is designed to catalyze, promising to create a public resource that will empower the entire biomedical research community and accelerate the pace of discovery for years to come.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is guided by a central, ambitious question: Can a single, unified computational model learn the fundamental 'rules' of cellular response by integrating the full breadth of public, multi-modal perturbation data? To address this, we have formulated three specific research questions (RQs), each with testable hypotheses that will structure our investigation. 

**RQ1: Can a multi-modal deep learning architecture learn a shared, biologically meaningful latent representation of cellular state that is predictive across diverse omics layers and perturbation types?**
The central premise of CellStateNet is that a unified representation of cellular state exists and can be learned from data. This latent space should capture the underlying biological processes that are perturbed, regardless of whether the perturbation is chemical or genetic, or whether the readout is transcriptomic or proteomic.
*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A self-supervised model, trained on the cross-modal task of predicting the proteomic state of a cell from its transcriptomic state (and vice versa) under a given perturbation, will learn a latent space whose dimensions are significantly enriched for canonical biological pathways and gene ontology terms. 
*   **Hypothesis 1b:** The latent embeddings of perturbations learned by the model will cluster according to their known mechanism of action (MoA), demonstrating that the model captures functional similarities between distinct chemical and genetic interventions.
*   **Hypothesis 1c:** A multi-modal model will outperform single-modality autoencoders in downstream predictive tasks, as the integration of multiple data types provides a more constrained and robust representation of cellular state.
*   **Validation:** We will test H1a by performing systematic enrichment analyses (e.g., GSEA) on genes highly weighted in each latent dimension. For H1b, we will use clustering metrics (e.g., silhouette score) to quantify the separation of perturbations by MoA in the learned embedding space. For H1c, we will establish a suite of benchmark tasks (e.g., predicting cell viability) and compare the performance of CellStateNet's representations against those from models trained on transcriptomics or proteomics alone.

**RQ2: Can the trained CellStateNet model accurately predict the molecular and phenotypic outcomes of unseen perturbations, including novel drug combinations and uncharacterized genetic variants?**
A truly foundational model must possess predictive power beyond its training data, demonstrating true generalization. We will rigorously test the model's ability to make *de novo* predictions for perturbations it has not seen during training.
*   **Hypothesis 2a:** CellStateNet can predict the full transcriptomic profile of a cell's response to a combination of two drugs, given only data on the effects of each drug individually. The model's predictions will accurately classify the interaction as synergistic, additive, or antagonistic when compared to experimental ground truth.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The model can predict the phenotypic consequences (e.g., cell fitness score from DepMap) of introducing an uncharacterized, non-coding genetic variant by first predicting its impact on the expression of nearby genes and then propagating this molecular change through the model to a final phenotype.
*   **Validation:** For H2a, we will employ a temporal hold-out strategy, training the model on public data up to a specific year and testing its ability to predict the results of combination screens published subsequently. We will compare predicted gene expression vectors using cosine similarity and correlation, and synergy scores using established metrics. For H2b, we will leverage data from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and variant effect mapping studies (e.g., MaveDB) as ground truth, assessing the correlation between our model's predicted fitness effects and experimentally measured ones for held-out variants.

**RQ3: Can CellStateNet function as an *in silico* discovery engine to generate novel, testable hypotheses about synergistic therapeutic strategies and key drivers of cellular state transitions?**
The ultimate utility of CellStateNet lies in its application as a tool for scientific discovery. We will use the trained model to probe complex biological systems and generate high-priority hypotheses for experimental validation.
*   **Hypothesis 3a:** An *in silico* screen using CellStateNet across millions of virtual compound pairs against a specific cancer cell line model will identify novel synergistic combinations at a rate significantly higher than random chance.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** Model interpretability techniques (e.g., integrated gradients, attention analysis) applied to the model's prediction of a transition from a healthy to a diseased cellular state can identify key genes and pathways that act as critical drivers of the transition.
*   **Validation:** For H3a, we will generate a ranked list of predicted synergistic pairs for a well-studied cancer model (e.g., MCF-7 breast cancer) and assess the enrichment of known synergies and plausible biological mechanisms in the top predictions by cross-referencing literature and pathway databases. For H3b, we will simulate a disease transition (e.g., oncogenic transformation) and compare the model-identified driver genes with known oncogenes and tumor suppressors from databases like COSMIC, testing for significant overlap.

**Expected Deliverables:** This research will produce: (1) A comprehensive, harmonized, and analysis-ready database of public perturbation-response data. (2) The open-source code for the CellStateNet model architecture and training pipeline. (3) The pre-trained CellStateNet model weights. (4) A user-friendly web portal and API for querying the model. (5) A series of high-impact publications detailing the model and its applications.

Methods And Approach

Our methodology is structured into three synergistic aims, designed to create a robust, validated, and accessible foundational model. This project is exclusively computational and will synthesize existing public data, aligning perfectly with the research call.

**Aim 1: Community-Scale Data Aggregation, Harmonization, and Curation.**
This foundational aim addresses the critical challenge of data fragmentation. Our working group will develop a scalable, reproducible pipeline to process and unify the world's major cellular perturbation datasets.
*   **Data Sources:** We will integrate data from multiple modalities: 
    *   **Transcriptomics:** The LINCS L1000 dataset (~1.3M profiles of ~20,000 small molecules and ~20,000 genetic perturbations across ~100 cell lines) will form the core. We will supplement this with curated, large-scale perturbation studies from GEO and ArrayExpress, including single-cell datasets (e.g., sci-Plex, Perturb-seq) to capture cell-to-cell heterogeneity.
    *   **Functional Genomics:** Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens from the DepMap and Achilles projects, providing fitness data for ~18,000 gene knockouts across >1000 cancer cell lines.
    *   **Proteomics & Phosphoproteomics:** Datasets from CPTAC detailing proteomic changes in response to drugs in cancer cell lines, and relevant studies from the PRIDE repository.
    *   **Epigenomics:** We will incorporate ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE and GEO that profile chromatin accessibility and histone modifications following specific perturbations, providing another layer of cellular state information.
*   **Harmonization and Curation Pipeline:** This is a major undertaking requiring diverse expertise. (1) **Standardized Metadata:** We will develop a unified schema to capture critical metadata, mapping cell lines to Cellosaurus IDs, chemical compounds to PubChem/ChEMBL IDs, and genes/proteins to Ensembl/HGNC/UniProt IDs. (2) **Standardized Data Processing:** We will create and publish containerized (e.g., Docker/Singularity) workflows for processing each data type from its raw form to an analysis-ready matrix, ensuring reproducibility. For example, RNA-seq data will be uniformly processed through a Kallisto/STAR pipeline. (3) **Quality Control:** Automated QC metrics will be implemented to flag and potentially exclude low-quality samples, and computational methods like ComBat will be used to mitigate batch effects where appropriate. (4) **Unified Data Structure:** The final output will be a single, cohesive data object (e.g., stored in HDF5 or Zarr format) containing all data modalities and metadata, ready for model training.

**Aim 2: Development and Training of the CellStateNet Foundational Model.**
This aim constitutes the core technical innovation of the project.
*   **Model Architecture:** CellStateNet will be a multi-modal, deep generative model. Its architecture will consist of three main components:
    1.  **Modality-Specific Encoders:** Each data type (transcriptome, proteome, etc.) will be fed into a dedicated encoder (e.g., a Transformer or a Residual Network) that learns to project the high-dimensional input into a common, lower-dimensional latent space.
    2.  **Perturbation Encoder:** Perturbations will be encoded into the same latent space. Small molecules will be represented by their graph structure using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), while genetic perturbations will be represented by learned embeddings for each gene.
    3.  **Integration Core:** A central cross-attention-based Transformer will form the core of the model. It will take the latent representation of the baseline cellular state and the perturbation embedding as input and predict the latent representation of the post-perturbation state. This predicted latent state is then passed to modality-specific decoders to generate the final molecular profiles.
*   **Self-Supervised Training:** The model will be trained on a multi-faceted, self-supervised objective function without requiring labeled data. The primary task will be **cross-modal prediction**: given a cell's baseline state and a perturbation, the model will be trained to predict the post-perturbation state in one modality (e.g., proteomics) using the post-perturbation state from another modality (e.g., transcriptomics) as input. This forces the model to learn the intricate relationships between different molecular layers. We will supplement this with a contrastive loss to ensure that similar perturbations result in similar latent space trajectories.
*   **Computational Scale:** Training a model of this complexity on terabytes of data is computationally intensive and requires resources beyond a single lab. We will leverage national HPC resources or cloud computing platforms, requiring an estimated 500,000 GPU-hours on NVIDIA A100 or equivalent hardware. This demonstrates a clear need for NCEMS support.

**Aim 3: Rigorous Model Validation and Application for Hypothesis Generation.**
*   **Validation Strategy:** We will employ a multi-pronged validation approach. **Intrinsic validation** will assess the model's accuracy on its self-supervised training objectives using a held-out test set of perturbations and cell lines. **Extrinsic validation** will evaluate the model's performance on a series of predefined downstream tasks that it was not explicitly trained on, as detailed in RQ2. This includes predicting drug synergy, forecasting variant effects, and classifying drug mechanism-of-action.
*   **Application Case Studies:** To demonstrate the model's utility, we will conduct two in-depth case studies: (1) **Oncology:** We will perform a large-scale *in silico* screen for synergistic drug combinations to overcome resistance to KRAS inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma models. (2) **Genetic Disease:** We will predict the molecular consequences of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) in the CFTR gene, aiming to stratify them by their likely functional impact and identify potential patient-specific therapeutic avenues.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Finalize data sources; build and execute the data harmonization pipeline (Deliverable: Harmonized dataset v1.0). Develop and benchmark prototype model architectures.
*   **Year 2:** Complete the first full-scale training of CellStateNet v1.0. Perform intrinsic validation and begin extrinsic validation benchmarks. Develop the prototype web portal. (Deliverable: Pre-trained model v1.0 and associated open-source code).
*   **Year 3:** Refine model architecture and retrain (v2.0) based on validation results. Complete all extrinsic validation and application case studies. Finalize and launch the public web portal. Disseminate results through publications and conference presentations. (Deliverable: Final model, web portal, and primary manuscript).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

The CellStateNet project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes and exert a profound impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences, directly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS program to catalyze synthesis-driven discovery.

**Intended Contributions to the Field:**
Our primary contribution will be a paradigm shift in how cellular systems are modeled computationally. We will move the field from a collection of bespoke, task-specific models to a single, general-purpose foundational model. This is analogous to the impact of models like AlphaFold and GPT-3 in their respective domains. 
1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of the Cell:** CellStateNet will be the first computational model to learn the relationships between diverse molecular layers (transcriptome, proteome, etc.) and perturbation types (chemical, genetic) from the ground up, using the entirety of the world's relevant public data. It will provide a quantitative, system-level framework for understanding how cellular networks process information and respond to stimuli.
2.  **A Powerful Engine for Hypothesis Generation:** By enabling rapid, large-scale *in silico* experimentation, CellStateNet will dramatically accelerate the scientific discovery cycle. Biologists will be able to prioritize experiments, screen vast combinatorial spaces of perturbations that are experimentally intractable, and generate novel, data-driven hypotheses about disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.
3.  **A Community-Wide Resource:** We are not just building a model; we are building an ecosystem. The project will deliver a meticulously harmonized database, a pre-trained model, open-source software, and an accessible web portal. This comprehensive suite of resources will empower researchers globally, regardless of their computational expertise, to leverage petabytes of public data to answer their own specific biological questions.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The impact of CellStateNet will extend far beyond basic science, with significant potential for translational and clinical applications.
*   **Accelerating Therapeutic Development:** In pharmacology and drug discovery, CellStateNet can be used to predict the efficacy and off-target effects of novel compounds, identify synergistic drug combinations to combat drug resistance, and rationally design polypharmacology strategies. This could significantly reduce the cost and failure rate of preclinical drug development.
*   **Enabling Precision Medicine:** The model can be conditioned on specific genetic backgrounds, allowing for personalized predictions of a patient's response to various therapies based on their tumor's mutational profile or their personal genome. This is a critical step towards true data-driven precision medicine.
*   **Deciphering Complex Diseases:** For complex genetic diseases, CellStateNet can help elucidate the functional consequences of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), providing a powerful tool for genetic diagnosis and for understanding the molecular etiology of disease.

**Dissemination, Data Sharing, and Open Science:**
Our working group is deeply committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science. All products of this research will be made promptly and freely available to the public.
*   **Publications:** We will target high-impact journals like *Nature*, *Science*, or *Cell* for the primary manuscript describing the model and its validation. Methodological advancements and specific applications will be published in leading specialized journals (*Nature Methods*, *Nature Biotechnology*).
*   **Open-Source Software:** All code for data processing, model training, and analysis will be version-controlled and hosted on GitHub under a permissive license (e.g., MIT).
*   **Open Data and Models:** The complete, harmonized dataset will be deposited in a permanent public repository (e.g., Zenodo). The final pre-trained model weights and an easy-to-use Python API will be released to facilitate fine-tuning and downstream applications by the community.
*   **Training and Outreach:** We will develop tutorials, documentation, and run workshops at major computational biology conferences (e.g., ISMB, RECOMB) to train the next generation of scientists in using CellStateNet. The creation of a public web portal is a key part of our strategy to ensure the model's accessibility to the entire biomedical community.

**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**
CellStateNet is envisioned not as a static, one-time product, but as a living resource for the community. The open-source framework we develop will be extensible, allowing for the future incorporation of new data modalities (e.g., metabolomics, spatial omics, high-content imaging) as they become widely available. The success of this project will establish a new standard for data synthesis in biology and will seed a vibrant ecosystem of follow-up research, where scientists around the world use, extend, and build upon our foundational model to probe countless biological questions.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research is a large-scale, computationally intensive effort that requires a diverse, collaborative team and significant resources beyond the capacity of a single institution. The budget reflects the personnel, computational power, and collaborative infrastructure necessary to achieve our ambitious goals over a three-year period. The total requested budget is $2,450,000.

**1. Personnel ($1,500,000):**

NCEMS support is critical to provide the necessary computational infrastructure, personnel coordination, and collaborative environment to build a truly foundational resource for the entire biosciences community.",,
ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_07,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,The Living Material: A Data-Driven Framework for Understanding the Emergent Mechanics of the Cytoskeleton,"The cell's ability to maintain its shape, move, and divide is an emergent property of the cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of protein polymers, motors, and cross-linkers. While we understand the individual components, how they collectively generate robust, cell-scale mechanical behavior remains a key question. This project will bridge the gap between molecular components and cellular mechanics by creating a multi-scale, data-driven modeling framework. We will form a working group of biophysicists, materials scientists, cell biologists, and computer vision experts to synthesize diverse public data types. We will integrate 3D ultrastructural data of cytoskeletal networks from cryo-electron tomography (EMPIAR), dynamic live-cell imaging data of cytoskeletal components (IDR), quantitative proteomics of cytoskeleton-associated proteins (PRIDE), and cell mechanics measurements from atomic force microscopy (AFM) repositories. Our innovative approach involves using AI-powered segmentation to extract detailed architectural parameters (e.g., filament length, orientation, cross-link density) from tomograms. These structural 'ground truths' will be correlated with protein composition from proteomics data. This integrated information will then be used to parameterize and validate a new generation of agent-based and continuum mechanics models that predict emergent properties like cell stiffness, viscosity, and force generation. This multi-modal data integration and multi-scale modeling is far beyond the capabilities of a single lab. The project will deliver a powerful, predictive model of the cell as a 'living material,' enabling us to understand how molecular-level mutations found in diseases like cancer and muscular dystrophy lead to defects in emergent cellular mechanics. All models and integrated datasets will be shared openly, providing a foundational resource for the mechanobiology community.",,"Background And Significance

The cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of protein filaments—actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments—that permeates the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. This intricate scaffold is not static; it is an active, living material, constantly remodeled by a host of associated proteins, including molecular motors that generate force and cross-linkers that modulate network architecture. The emergent mechanical properties of this network govern fundamental cellular processes, from cell division and migration to mechanotransduction and tissue morphogenesis. A central challenge in cell biology is to understand how the collective interactions of these molecular components give rise to the robust, adaptable mechanical behavior observed at the cellular scale. For decades, research has largely followed two parallel tracks. On one hand, cell biologists have used fluorescence microscopy to visualize the dynamics of specific proteins, providing crucial insights into their localization and function. On the other hand, biophysicists have employed techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical tweezers to probe the mechanical properties of cells and reconstituted cytoskeletal networks. Seminal work on reconstituted actin networks, for example, has revealed how cross-linker density and filament length control the viscoelastic properties of the material, establishing the cytoskeleton as a prime example of soft condensed matter. Similarly, theoretical frameworks such as active gel theory have provided powerful phenomenological models that capture the behavior of the cytoskeleton as a fluid-like material driven by internal stresses generated by motor proteins. However, a significant gap persists between our understanding of individual components and the integrated, emergent mechanics of the cell. Models are often parameterized using data from simplified in vitro systems, which lack the molecular crowding, spatial confinement, and compositional complexity of the native cellular environment. While techniques like super-resolution microscopy have improved our view of the cytoskeleton, they often lack the 3D isotropic resolution and molecular identification needed to map the complete network architecture. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a transformative technology, providing nanometer-resolution 3D snapshots of the cytoskeleton within vitrified, near-native state cells. These tomograms contain a wealth of architectural information—filament lengths, orientations, branching angles, and cross-linker distributions—that has been largely untapped due to the immense challenge of manual segmentation and analysis. The recent explosion of publicly available data presents an unprecedented opportunity to bridge this gap. Large-scale repositories like the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR), the Image Data Resource (IDR), and the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database now house a critical mass of ultrastructural, dynamic, and compositional data from a wide range of cell types and conditions. This project is timely because recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning-based image segmentation, provide the necessary tools to automate the extraction of quantitative architectural information from cryo-ET data at scale. By synthesizing these disparate data modalities—ultrastructure, composition, dynamics, and mechanics—we can construct a new generation of data-driven, multi-scale models. Such a framework is essential for addressing fundamental questions in mechanobiology and disease. For instance, in cancer, altered cell mechanics are a hallmark of metastasis, but the underlying changes in cytoskeletal architecture and composition are poorly understood. Similarly, many congenital myopathies and cardiomyopathies are caused by mutations in cytoskeletal proteins, but how these molecular defects propagate to cause tissue-level mechanical failure remains unclear. This proposal outlines a collaborative, transdisciplinary effort to build a predictive framework of the cell as a living material, directly linking molecular-level details to emergent cellular function and dysfunction.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is guided by the overarching question: How do the specific 3D architecture, molecular composition, and dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton collectively determine the emergent mechanical properties of the cell? To deconstruct this complex problem, we have formulated four specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) and their corresponding testable hypotheses (H). 

RQ1: What are the fundamental quantitative principles governing the 3D architecture of distinct cytoskeletal assemblies (e.g., lamellipodial actin networks, stress fibers, cortical actin) in their native cellular context? 
H1: We hypothesize that different functional assemblies of the cytoskeleton are characterized by unique and quantifiable architectural signatures. Specifically, we predict that lamellipodial networks will exhibit a high density of short, branched filaments with a narrow orientation distribution, consistent with dendritic nucleation, whereas stress fibers will be defined by long, aligned filaments with a high density of bundling cross-linkers. We further hypothesize that these architectural parameters are not random but follow specific statistical distributions (e.g., exponential length distributions) that reflect the underlying polymerization and severing dynamics. This hypothesis will be tested by applying our AI-powered segmentation pipeline to public cryo-ET tomograms of various cell types and subcellular regions, extracting a multi-dimensional vector of architectural features (filament density, length distribution, orientation tensor, cross-link density, mesh size) for each region. 

RQ2: How does the local proteomic composition of the cytoskeleton correlate with, and potentially determine, its local 3D architecture? 
H2: We hypothesize that a direct, predictive relationship exists between the relative abundance of key cytoskeleton-associated proteins and the observed network architecture. For example, we predict that the local ratio of Arp2/3 complex to formins, inferred from whole-cell proteomics data, will strongly correlate with the degree of filament branching versus alignment observed in cryo-ET. Similarly, the ratio of bundling proteins (e.g., fascin, alpha-actinin) to cross-linking proteins (e.g., filamin) will correlate with the prevalence of filament bundles versus isotropic networks. We will test this by integrating quantitative proteomics data (from PRIDE) with our architectural measurements from cryo-ET for matched cell types. We will build a statistical correlation model to identify key protein determinants of specific architectural motifs. 

RQ3: Can a multi-scale computational model, parameterized directly with integrated architectural and proteomic data, accurately predict the emergent, cell-scale mechanical properties measured experimentally? 
H3: We hypothesize that an agent-based model (ABM) of the cytoskeleton, whose parameters (e.g., filament lengths, cross-linker densities, motor protein concentrations) are directly sampled from the distributions derived from cryo-ET and proteomics data, will quantitatively reproduce the bulk mechanical responses (e.g., Young's modulus, viscoelastic loss and storage moduli) of cells as measured by AFM. We predict that our data-driven model will outperform models parameterized with generic or in vitro-derived values. Validation will be achieved by simulating AFM indentation on our virtual cytoskeletons and comparing the resulting force-displacement curves with publicly available experimental data for the same cell types. The model's success will be quantified by the root-mean-square error between simulated and experimental results. 

RQ4: How do disease-associated perturbations in cytoskeletal proteins alter network architecture and, consequently, the emergent cellular mechanics? 
H4: We hypothesize that our validated framework can predict the mechanical consequences of molecular perturbations. Specifically, we predict that simulating a cancer-associated upregulation of the severing protein cofilin (by decreasing the average filament length in the ABM's parameter set) will result in a significant decrease in predicted cell stiffness, consistent with the known phenotype of increased deformability in metastatic cells. Conversely, simulating a mutation that impairs the function of a cross-linking protein implicated in muscular dystrophy will lead to a predicted decrease in the network's ability to bear sustained loads. These predictions will be tested against public AFM datasets from cell lines expressing these specific mutations, providing a powerful validation of our model's predictive capability. 

Expected Deliverables: The primary deliverables will be: (1) A comprehensive, integrated database linking quantitative cytoskeletal architectures with proteomic profiles and mechanical properties for multiple cell types. (2) A suite of open-source, AI-driven software tools for segmenting and analyzing cytoskeletal networks in cryo-ET data. (3) A validated, multi-scale, and open-source computational model of the cytoskeleton that serves as a community resource. (4) A set of predictive 'phase diagrams' that map molecular composition and architecture to emergent mechanical phenotypes.

Methods And Approach

This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that requires a transdisciplinary working group and is organized into three synergistic phases. Our team comprises experts in cell biology (Dr. Lena Weber, microscopy data interpretation), biophysics (Dr. David Chen, modeling lead), computer science (Dr. Aisha Khan, AI/ML lead), materials science (Dr. Samuel Jones, continuum mechanics), proteomics (Dr. Maria Garcia), cryo-electron tomography (Dr. Ben Carter), and data science (Dr. Emily Sato), ensuring comprehensive expertise.

**Phase 1: Multi-Modal Data Curation, Integration, and Feature Extraction (Months 1-15)**
This foundational phase focuses on aggregating and harmonizing diverse public datasets. 
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically mine major public repositories. 
    *   **Ultrastructure (Cryo-ET):** We will source tomograms from EMPIAR, targeting high-resolution datasets of intact lamellipodia, stress fibers, and cortical regions from cell types like HeLa (e.g., EMPIAR-10491), U2OS, and primary neurons (e.g., EMPIAR-10164). We will select a minimum of 20 high-quality tomograms per cell type/condition to ensure statistical power.
    *   **Proteomics (Composition):** We will query the PRIDE archive for deep, quantitative mass spectrometry datasets from matching cell lines (e.g., PXD028842 for U2OS cells). We will focus on datasets that provide absolute or relative quantification of cytoskeletal and associated proteins.
    *   **Mechanics (Properties):** We will collate AFM indentation data from repositories like BioStudies, Dryad, and the AFM Data Bank. We will target datasets that provide force-indentation curves or reported Young's moduli for our chosen cell types under comparable culture conditions.
    *   **Dynamics (Live-cell Imaging):** We will use data from the Image Data Resource (IDR) (e.g., idr0075) showing dynamics of fluorescently-tagged cytoskeletal components. This data will not be used for initial parameterization but will be crucial for validating the dynamic aspects of our models in Phase 3 (e.g., turnover rates, filament growth speeds).
*   **Data Harmonization:** A critical task will be to develop a unified metadata schema to link these disparate datasets. We will create a relational database that maps datasets by cell line, genotype, and experimental conditions, enabling robust cross-modal analysis.
*   **AI-Powered Segmentation and Analysis:** This is the core innovation of Phase 1. We will develop a deep learning pipeline for automated segmentation of cytoskeletal elements from cryo-ET volumes. We will employ a 3D U-Net architecture, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) adept at biomedical image segmentation. The model will be trained on a 'ground truth' dataset of ~5-10 tomograms manually segmented by our cryo-ET expert. The trained model will then be applied to the full dataset to segment filaments (actin, microtubules), cross-links, and other structures. From these segmented volumes, a custom Python-based analysis toolkit will extract a rich set of quantitative architectural parameters: filament length and tortuosity distributions, orientation tensors, branching densities and angles, cross-linker/bundler densities, and network mesh size distributions.

**Phase 2: Multi-Scale Computational Modeling (Months 12-27)**
Using the quantitative data from Phase 1, we will develop a hierarchical modeling framework.
*   **Agent-Based Model (ABM):** At the microscale, we will use the open-source platform CytoSim to build a detailed ABM. Individual filaments will be modeled as semi-flexible polymers. Cross-linkers and motors will be modeled as two-headed spring-like elements with stochastic binding/unbinding kinetics. Crucially, instead of using generic parameters, the model will be instantiated by directly sampling from the statistical distributions of architectural parameters extracted in Phase 1. For example, the initial filament lengths in the simulation will be drawn from the experimentally measured length distribution. The concentrations of different agents (e.g., fascin vs. filamin) will be set by the relative abundances measured in the proteomics data.
*   **Continuum Mechanics Model:** To bridge to the cellular scale, we will develop a coarse-grained continuum model based on active gel theory. This model describes the cytoskeleton as a viscoelastic material with internal stresses. The key innovation is that the phenomenological parameters of this continuum model (e.g., elastic modulus, viscosity, active stress coefficient) will not be arbitrarily fitted. Instead, they will be systematically derived by performing numerical homogenization on large-scale simulations of the ABM. This creates a direct, mechanistic link between the microscale architecture and the macroscale material properties.

**Phase 3: Model Validation, Prediction, and Dissemination (Months 24-36)**
*   **Validation:** The framework's predictive power will be rigorously tested. We will simulate AFM indentation in both the ABM and continuum models. The resulting force-indentation curves and calculated Young's moduli will be compared directly against the experimental AFM data curated in Phase 1. We will also validate dynamic aspects by simulating processes like fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and comparing the recovery timescales to experimental data from the IDR.
*   **Predictive Simulations:** Once validated, the model will be used to test hypotheses about disease states (as outlined in RQ4). We will systematically alter specific model parameters to mimic known mutations (e.g., change cross-linker binding affinity, alter motor protein velocity) and predict the resulting changes in network architecture and bulk mechanics.
*   **Timeline and Milestones:**
    *   M6: Curation and harmonization of initial 20 datasets across four modalities.
    *   M12: Version 1.0 of the AI segmentation pipeline released on GitHub.
    *   M18: Complete architectural parameter database for three cell types.
    *   M24: First validated ABM for a single cell type, linking architecture to mechanics.
    *   M30: Continuum model parameterized and validated; predictive simulations of disease mutations initiated.
    *   M36: Final integrated database, all models, and analysis tools publicly released with comprehensive documentation and tutorials.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
1.  **A First-of-its-Kind Integrated Data Resource:** The primary outcome will be a publicly accessible, cross-modal database that quantitatively links 3D cytoskeletal ultrastructure, proteomic composition, and cell mechanical properties. This resource will be unique in its scope and level of detail, moving beyond qualitative descriptions to provide a quantitative, multi-scale view of the cell's mechanical machinery. It will serve as a gold-standard benchmark for the community, enabling researchers to formulate and test new hypotheses without the need for new data generation.
2.  **Novel, Open-Source Analytical Tools:** We will develop and disseminate a powerful, AI-driven software pipeline for the automated segmentation and quantitative analysis of cryo-ET data. This will break a major bottleneck in the field, democratizing the ability to extract rich architectural information from complex 3D imaging data. By making this tool open-source and providing extensive documentation, we will empower other researchers to apply it to their own data, vastly accelerating discovery in structural cell biology.
3.  **A Predictive, Multi-Scale Model of Cellular Mechanics:** Our core scientific contribution will be the creation of a validated, data-driven modeling framework that mechanistically connects molecular-level details to emergent, cell-scale mechanical behavior. This moves the field beyond correlative studies and phenomenological models, providing a truly predictive tool. This 'virtual cytoskeleton' will allow researchers to perform in silico experiments that are difficult or impossible to conduct in living cells, such as systematically titrating the concentration of a specific protein or altering its biophysical properties to observe the impact on cell stiffness or force generation.
4.  **Fundamental Insights into Cytoskeletal Design Principles:** By analyzing the relationships between composition, architecture, and mechanics across different cell types and functional assemblies, our project will uncover fundamental 'design principles' of the cytoskeleton. We expect to reveal how cells robustly tune their mechanical properties by modulating specific architectural features, providing deep insights into the evolution and function of this essential cellular system.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
*   **Biomedical Relevance:** The framework will have direct implications for understanding human disease. By modeling how mutations found in cancers, muscular dystrophies, or cardiomyopathies alter the cytoskeleton's mechanical properties, our work will provide a mechanistic basis for disease pathology. This could ultimately inform the development of novel diagnostics based on cell mechanics or therapeutics that target the cytoskeleton.
*   **Training the Next Generation:** This project is intrinsically designed to train graduate students and postdocs at the interface of biology, physics, and computer science. Trainees will gain invaluable hands-on experience in data synthesis, machine learning, computational modeling, and collaborative, open-team science. We will host an annual virtual 'data-thon' for the broader community, providing training on our tools and fostering a data-savvy workforce, directly aligning with the research call's goals.
*   **Advancing Open Science:** We are fully committed to open science principles. All curated data, analysis code, simulation models, and results will be made immediately and freely available through established repositories (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo, EMPIAR-S). This commitment ensures our outputs are a lasting community resource that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).
*   **Dissemination and Community Engagement:** We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, presentations at international conferences (e.g., ASCB, Biophysical Society), and a dedicated project website with tutorials and documentation. We will organize workshops at conferences to train researchers in the use of our tools, ensuring broad adoption and maximizing the project's impact.

**Long-Term Vision:** This project will establish a durable, collaborative network and a foundational framework that is extensible. In the future, this 'living material' model can be expanded to incorporate other cellular components, such as the cell membrane and nucleus, and other physical phenomena, like mechanochemical signaling. It will serve as a cornerstone for a future 'whole-cell' mechanical model, transforming our ability to understand and engineer cellular behavior.

ai_groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists_gemini_08,ai,groups_of_interdisciplinary_scientists,gemini-2.5-pro,Decoding the Chemical Lexicon of the Gut Microbiome: Emergent Host-Microbe Communication,"The gut microbiome profoundly influences host health and disease through a complex chemical dialogue, yet the 'words' of this language—the specific microbial molecules and their effects on host cells—are largely unknown. This project aims to systematically decode this chemical lexicon by integrating public metagenomic, metabolomic, and host transcriptomic data. Our multidisciplinary working group will include microbial ecologists, chemists, bioinformaticians, and immunologists. We will synthesize three key data types: 1) metagenomic data from SRA and MG-RAST to identify biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within microbial genomes, predicting their chemical products; 2) untargeted metabolomics data from MetaboLights and GNPS to identify the actual small molecules present in the gut; and 3) host transcriptomic and proteomic data (GEO, TCGA) from relevant clinical and gnotobiotic animal studies. The central innovation is a novel computational pipeline that probabilistically links BGCs to observed metabolites and correlates the presence of these microbe-derived molecules with specific host gene expression signatures in intestinal and immune cells. Using network inference and machine learning, we will construct a 'Microbe-Metabolite-Host Gene' atlas. This will allow us to understand how community-level changes in the microbiome's genetic potential lead to an emergent chemical environment that, in turn, orchestrates host physiology. The scale of data integration and the need for expertise spanning from microbial genetics to host immunology make this a quintessential community-scale project. The resulting 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas' will be a publicly accessible resource to generate hypotheses about how microbial metabolites drive emergent states of health and diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, paving the way for next-generation microbiome-based therapeutics.",,"Background And Significance

The community of microorganisms residing in the human gut, collectively known as the microbiome, functions as a complex, adaptive ecosystem that is integral to host physiology. This intricate relationship is not merely commensal; it is a deeply symbiotic partnership where host health emerges from a dynamic interplay of microbial community structure, metabolic function, and host response. The primary language of this host-microbe dialogue is chemical. Microbes produce a vast and diverse arsenal of small molecules—from simple short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) to complex polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides—that directly interact with host cells, shaping mucosal immunity, metabolic regulation, and even neurobehavioral development. Landmark studies have identified key examples of this chemical communication. For instance, the SCFA butyrate, produced by Firmicutes bacteria, serves as a primary energy source for colonocytes and acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, epigenetically regulating host gene expression to promote anti-inflammatory responses and fortify the gut barrier. Similarly, secondary bile acids, produced through multi-step microbial transformations, act as signaling molecules for nuclear receptors like FXR, influencing lipid metabolism and innate immunity. Despite these foundational discoveries, our understanding of this chemical lexicon remains rudimentary. The known microbial metabolites represent a tiny fraction of the chemical space within the gut. Untargeted metabolomics studies consistently reveal thousands of molecular features in fecal and intestinal samples, the vast majority of which are of unknown structure and origin—the 'dark matter' of the gut metabolome. Concurrently, advances in genomics have unveiled the immense biosynthetic potential encoded within microbial genomes. Computational tools like antiSMASH can predict tens of thousands of unique biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from public metagenomic data, each potentially producing a novel bioactive molecule. This creates two major knowledge gaps that impede progress in the field. The first is the 'gene-to-metabolite' gap: we cannot systematically link the predicted BGCs to the molecules they produce in the complex in vivo environment. The second is the 'metabolite-to-function' gap: for the thousands of unknown molecules we can detect, we lack any knowledge of their biological effects on the host. Current research efforts typically focus on one aspect of this triad—microbial composition, metabolomic profiles, or host gene expression—in isolation. While multi-omics studies are becoming more common, they often rely on simple correlation analyses between a few data types and are limited to the scale of a single lab or cohort. A systematic, integrative approach to connect all three layers—microbial genetic potential, the resulting chemical environment, and the host's cellular response—has not been undertaken at a community-wide scale. This project is both important and timely because we are at a unique inflection point. The exponential growth of publicly available data in repositories like NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the MetaboLights database, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has created an unprecedented, yet underutilized, resource. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning, network theory, and computational chemistry provide the necessary tools to synthesize these disparate datasets. By framing host physiology as an emergent property of the microbiome's collective chemical output, we can move beyond descriptive cataloging of microbes. This research will establish a new paradigm for understanding host-microbe symbiosis, treating it as a complex system where community-level microbial genetics gives rise to a chemical milieu that orchestrates host cellular behavior. Decoding this lexicon is critical for translating microbiome science into predictable, mechanism-based therapeutics for a wide range of human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune disorders.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is organized around three central aims, each designed to bridge a critical gap in our understanding of host-microbe chemical communication. By systematically integrating public multi-omics data, we will construct a comprehensive atlas that maps the flow of information from microbial genes to microbial chemicals to host cellular responses, thereby elucidating the emergent properties of this complex system.

**Aim 1: To construct a probabilistic linkage map between microbial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and observed gut metabolites.**
This aim addresses the fundamental 'gene-to-metabolite' gap. While we can predict the biosynthetic potential of the microbiome, we lack a systematic method to identify the actual molecular products in vivo.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can we statistically associate the presence and abundance patterns of specific BGCs across thousands of public metagenomes with the presence and abundance of specific metabolite features in corresponding public metabolomes?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** The co-occurrence patterns of a BGC and its true metabolic product across diverse human cohorts will exhibit a significantly stronger statistical dependency than random BGC-metabolite pairs. We hypothesize that a multi-modal machine learning framework, integrating correlation metrics, mutual information, and probabilistic graphical models, can identify these true pairings with a quantifiable confidence score.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will test this hypothesis by first applying our pipeline to a 'gold standard' set of known BGC-metabolite pairs (e.g., those for butyrate synthesis, secondary bile acid conversion, salinomycin). Our model must recover these known links with high probability. For novel predictions, we will perform in silico validation by comparing the predicted elemental formula from the BGC's biosynthetic pathway with the formula derived from high-resolution mass spectrometry data of the linked metabolite. The expected outcome is a comprehensive, weighted BGC-Metabolite map, representing the first large-scale dictionary linking microbial genetic potential to chemical output.

**Aim 2: To identify host cellular pathways that are significantly modulated by specific microbe-derived metabolites.**
This aim tackles the 'metabolite-to-function' gap by connecting the chemical environment of the gut to the host's physiological response at the molecular level.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Which host gene expression signatures in intestinal epithelial cells and gut-resident immune cells consistently co-vary with the abundance of specific microbial metabolites across diverse health and disease states (e.g., IBD vs. healthy, CRC vs. healthy)?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** Specific microbial metabolites, or structurally related families of metabolites, will be significantly and reproducibly correlated with the coordinated up- or down-regulation of distinct host biological pathways. For example, we predict that a class of unidentified polyketides will correlate with the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, while certain bacterially-modified lipids will correlate with inflammasome activation signatures in host immune cells.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We will leverage public datasets from gnotobiotic mouse experiments, where the host is colonized with defined microbial communities, as a validation cohort. In these controlled systems, the links between specific microbes, their metabolites, and host response are less confounded. We will test if the metabolite-pathway associations discovered in human data can predict host gene expression changes in these gnotobiotic models. Furthermore, we will cross-reference our findings with pharmacological databases (e.g., STITCH, DrugBank) to see if our predicted bioactive metabolites are structurally similar to known drugs that target the implicated host pathways.

**Aim 3: To build and query an integrated 'Microbe-Metabolite-Host Gene' atlas to model emergent host phenotypes.**
This aim synthesizes the findings from Aims 1 and 2 into a unified, multi-layered network model to understand the system-level properties of host-microbe communication.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can a multi-scale network model, representing the flow of information from microbial community genetics to the chemical environment and ultimately to the host's transcriptional state, reveal principles of emergent host-microbe homeostasis and dysbiosis?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** The topology of the integrated network will reveal 'keystone' metabolites and 'communication hubs'—molecules that are central to mediating the microbiome's influence on the host. We hypothesize that the state of this integrated network, captured using graph-based machine learning features, will be more predictive of host phenotype (e.g., IBD diagnosis or treatment response) than any single data modality alone.
*   **Testing and Validation:** The predictive power of our integrated atlas will be rigorously tested on held-out datasets not used in model construction. We will build machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Graph Convolutional Networks) to predict disease status using features derived from: (1) metagenomics only, (2) metabolomics only, (3) host transcriptomics only, and (4) our integrated network. Our hypothesis will be supported if the integrated model demonstrates significantly superior performance (e.g., higher AUROC and AUPRC). The primary deliverable will be the 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas,' an open-access, interactive web portal for the scientific community to explore these multi-omic relationships.

Methods And Approach

**Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonization**
This project exclusively utilizes publicly available data. Our first task is to build a comprehensive, curated, and harmonized data repository. 
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically query major public repositories including NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and MG-RAST for metagenomic data; MetaboLights, GNPS, and Metabolomics Workbench for untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data; and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for host transcriptomic data (RNA-seq). We will prioritize studies with multiple data types from the same subjects, such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database.
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** We will select datasets based on rigorous criteria: (1) availability of raw data (e.g., FASTQ, mzML); (2) sufficient sequencing depth or instrument resolution; (3) comprehensive and standardized metadata (e.g., diagnosis, sample type, age, sex); (4) studies focusing on human gut samples or relevant gnotobiotic mouse models. We anticipate aggregating over 10,000 metagenomes, 5,000 metabolomes, and 5,000 transcriptomes.
*   **Standardized Re-processing:** To mitigate batch effects and ensure comparability, all raw data will be re-processed through standardized, containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipelines. Metagenomic reads will be quality-controlled with FastQC/Trimmomatic and assembled with MEGAHIT. Metabolomic data will be processed using a uniform MZmine 2 workflow for feature detection and alignment. RNA-seq data will be processed via a STAR/RSEM pipeline for alignment and quantification.

**Aim 1: BGC-Metabolite Linkage Pipeline**
1.  **BGC Prediction and Grouping:** Assembled metagenomic contigs will be analyzed with antiSMASH (v6.0) to identify BGCs. The predicted BGCs will then be grouped into Gene Cluster Families (GCFs) using BiG-SCAPE, which compares BGCs based on domain architecture and sequence similarity. This reduces the complexity from millions of individual BGCs to tens of thousands of GCFs. The output will be a sample-by-GCF abundance matrix.
2.  **Metabolite Feature Networking:** Processed metabolomic features will be organized using molecular networking on the GNPS platform. This method groups ions with similar fragmentation spectra (MS/MS), which often correspond to structurally related molecules. This creates a sample-by-metabolite feature/family abundance matrix.
3.  **Probabilistic Association:** We will employ a multi-pronged statistical approach to link the GCF and metabolite matrices. We will first use Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) to identify latent variables that explain the maximum shared variance between the two datasets. In parallel, we will use tools like MIMOSA2, which models the conditional probability of a metabolic pathway's (or GCF's) activity given the community composition. Finally, we will construct a probabilistic graphical model to infer direct dependencies. The consensus from these methods will generate a high-confidence list of BGC-metabolite links, each with a quantitative confidence score.

**Aim 2: Metabolite-Host Pathway Correlation Pipeline**
1.  **Host Transcriptome Analysis:** For samples with paired metabolomics and host transcriptomics, we will perform differential expression analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify host pathways that are active in specific conditions. 
2.  **Multi-Omic Correlation:** We will use the WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) R package to identify modules of highly co-expressed host genes. The eigengene (first principal component) of each module, which represents the module's overall expression pattern, will then be correlated with the abundance of every microbial metabolite feature. This powerful approach reduces multiple testing burdens and identifies metabolites associated with entire biological processes rather than single genes. We will use linear mixed-effects models to account for covariates and repeated measures where applicable.

**Aim 3: Atlas Construction and Predictive Modeling**
1.  **Network Integration:** The results from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated into a multi-partite graph using network analysis libraries (e.g., NetworkX in Python). The graph will contain three types of nodes (GCFs, Metabolites, Host Genes/Pathways). Edges will connect nodes based on the analyses above, weighted by the statistical significance (e.g., correlation coefficient, probability score) of the association.
2.  **Topological Analysis and Hypothesis Generation:** We will analyze the network's structure to identify key features. Centrality algorithms (e.g., betweenness, degree) will pinpoint 'keystone' metabolites that bridge many microbes to many host functions. Community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain modularity) will reveal functional modules, such as a group of microbes producing a class of metabolites that collectively modulate a specific immune pathway.
3.  **Graph-Based Machine Learning:** To test the predictive power of the atlas, we will use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). A GCN is a type of neural network that operates directly on graphs, learning to classify nodes or entire graphs. We will train a GCN to classify samples as 'healthy' or 'diseased' (e.g., IBD) using the integrated network structure and node abundances as input. The model's performance will be evaluated on a held-out test set and compared against baseline models using single data types.

**Timeline and Milestones**
*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition, curation, and establishment of standardized processing pipelines. Development and benchmarking of the BGC-Metabolite linkage pipeline. Milestone: A fully operational, containerized workflow for processing all three data types; processing of 50% of target datasets.
*   **Year 2:** Full-scale execution of Aim 1 and Aim 2 analyses. Milestone: Generation of the first draft of the BGC-Metabolite map and a prioritized list of metabolite-host pathway associations. First manuscript in preparation.
*   **Year 3:** Integration of results into the network atlas (Aim 3). Development of the predictive GCN model. Design and implementation of the public-facing interactive web portal. Milestone: A functional beta version of the 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas' web portal.
*   **Year 4:** Model refinement, validation on independent cohorts, and finalization of the Atlas. Dissemination activities, including manuscript submissions, conference presentations, and community training workshops. Milestone: Public release of the Atlas and all associated code; submission of two major manuscripts.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field**
This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by fundamentally shifting how we study host-microbiome interactions. 
1.  **A New Paradigm for Microbiome Research:** Our primary outcome will be a paradigm shift from descriptive, census-based studies ('who is there?') to a mechanistic, function-centric understanding ('what are they doing and how does it matter?'). By decoding the chemical language of the microbiome, we will provide a framework for understanding how emergent host phenotypes, such as immune homeostasis or disease susceptibility, arise from the collective metabolic output of a complex microbial community. This directly addresses the research call's focus on emergence phenomena.
2.  **A Foundational, Community-Wide Resource:** The principal deliverable, the 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas,' will be a first-of-its-kind, publicly accessible resource. Analogous to foundational databases like KEGG for metabolic pathways or the Gene Ontology for gene function, our Atlas will provide a comprehensive, queryable map of microbe-metabolite-host interactions. This will empower researchers, even those without deep computational expertise, to generate novel, data-driven hypotheses. For example, an immunologist studying a specific cytokine could query the Atlas to identify candidate microbial metabolites that regulate its expression, along with the microbes and genes responsible for their production.
3.  **Methodological Innovation in Multi-omics Integration:** The computational pipeline we develop will be a significant methodological advancement. Integrating three distinct and high-dimensional data types (genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics) poses immense statistical and computational challenges. Our novel framework, combining network science, probabilistic modeling, and graph-based machine learning, will provide a robust and adaptable blueprint for data synthesis that can be applied to other complex biological systems beyond the gut microbiome.

**Broader Impacts and Applications**
Beyond its fundamental scientific contributions, this project will have far-reaching impacts on therapeutic development, workforce training, and the practice of open science.
1.  **Accelerating Therapeutic and Diagnostic Development:** The Atlas will serve as a powerful engine for hypothesis generation, directly informing the development of next-generation microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. Identifying specific anti-inflammatory metabolites could lead to the development of 'postbiotic' drugs for IBD. Conversely, discovering microbial metabolites that promote cell proliferation could yield new non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer. Our work will provide a mechanistic rationale for the targeted manipulation of the microbiome, moving beyond the trial-and-error approach of fecal microbiota transplantation.
2.  **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment for the 'future data-savvy workforce' envisioned by the research call. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work in a deeply collaborative, transdisciplinary team, gaining hands-on expertise at the cutting edge of computational biology, bioinformatics, microbiology, and immunology. We will host an annual open-to-the-public workshop to disseminate our methods and train the broader community, thereby amplifying our educational impact.
3.  **Championing Open and Reproducible Science:** Our commitment to open science is unwavering. All computational pipelines will be developed as open-source software with comprehensive documentation and distributed via platforms like GitHub. All processed data and results, including the final Atlas, will be deposited in public repositories and made accessible through our web portal, adhering to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. This ensures our work is transparent, reproducible, and serves as a lasting resource for the entire scientific community.

**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision**
Our dissemination strategy is multi-faceted, designed to maximize reach and impact. We will publish our primary findings in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Nature Biotechnology, Cell Host & Microbe). We will present our work at key international conferences (e.g., Keystone Symposia on the Microbiome, ISMB). The interactive web portal will be our primary tool for broad dissemination to the research community. Our long-term vision is for the Chemical Lexicon Atlas to become a living resource, continuously updated with new public data and analytical tools, sustained through future funding and community collaboration. This project will lay the foundation for a new era of predictive, systems-level understanding of the microbiome's role in health and disease.

Communication breakdown, altered cellular composition, and microenvironmental changes collectively drive organ dysfunction. This project will create a comprehensive, cross-tissue atlas of aging at single-cell resolution to dissect these emergent phenomena. We will assemble a team of gerontologists, computational biologists, and single-cell genomics experts to synthesize the rapidly growing body of public single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from multiple tissues and organisms (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis, Human Cell Atlas, GTEx). The primary challenge, which requires a collaborative, community-scale effort, is the development of novel computational methods to harmonize and integrate these heterogeneous datasets, correcting for technical batch effects while preserving true biological variation related to age, tissue, and species. Using this integrated atlas, we will first define robust, consensus 'aging signatures' for every major cell type, moving beyond tissue-specific markers. Second, we will apply advanced algorithms for inferring cell-cell communication networks to map how signaling pathways between different cell populations (e.g., immune-stromal, epithelial-fibroblast) are systematically rewired during aging. This will allow us to identify the key intercellular communication failures that precede functional decline. The project will produce a foundational, open-access 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' providing unprecedented insights into how tissue-level senescence emerges from changes in the composition and interaction of its constituent cells. This resource will be invaluable for identifying novel, pan-tissue targets for pro-longevity interventions and will train a cohort of researchers in the complex analysis of large-scale single-cell data.",,"Background And Significance

Aging is a complex, multifactorial process and the primary risk factor for most chronic human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. For decades, research has focused on cell-intrinsic mechanisms, elegantly summarized in the 'Hallmarks of Aging' framework (López-Otín et al., 2013, 2023). These hallmarks, such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, and epigenetic alterations, describe molecular damage accumulating within individual cells. While this paradigm has been incredibly fruitful, it provides an incomplete picture. It largely overlooks the fact that tissues are not mere collections of independent cells, but complex, dynamic ecosystems. Organismal aging, we posit, is an emergent property arising from the progressive deterioration of these ecosystems, driven by altered cellular composition and a systemic breakdown in intercellular communication. This project reframes aging from a cell-centric problem to a systems-level challenge in cellular ecology. Evidence for this ecological view is mounting. The concept of 'inflammaging' describes a chronic, low-grade, sterile inflammation that characterizes aged tissues, driven by dysfunctional communication between immune cells and stromal cells (Franceschi et al., 2018). Similarly, the accumulation of senescent cells, which secrete a potent mix of inflammatory factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), profoundly remodels the local tissue microenvironment, disrupting homeostasis and promoting age-related pathologies (Coppé et al., 2010). These phenomena highlight that the context and communication between cells are as critical as their individual internal states. The recent explosion in single-cell genomics, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), provides an unprecedented opportunity to deconstruct these complex tissue ecosystems at high resolution. Large-scale public consortia like the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, and Tabula Muris Senis have generated vast repositories of single-cell data from diverse tissues across the lifespan of multiple organisms. These datasets represent a monumental, yet largely untapped, resource for understanding aging as a systemic process. The primary bottleneck preventing a holistic synthesis is a formidable computational and logistical challenge. These datasets were generated by hundreds of different laboratories using varied protocols, platforms, and processing pipelines. This heterogeneity introduces profound technical batch effects that can easily mask the subtle biological signals of aging. While numerous computational methods for data integration exist (e.g., Seurat v4, Harmony, Scanpy), they were primarily designed for smaller-scale projects and often struggle to harmonize data across different technologies, species, and tissues without erasing crucial biological variance. A community-scale effort, uniting experts in gerontology, computational biology, and systems biology, is required to overcome this barrier. This research is therefore critically important and timely. The data exists, but the collaborative framework and advanced analytical strategies to synthesize it into a coherent whole are missing. By creating a unified, pan-tissue 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' this project will address a fundamental gap in our knowledge: how do cell-intrinsic changes translate into the emergent, system-wide functional decline of an organism? Answering this question will not only provide a new conceptual framework for aging research but also reveal novel, high-priority targets for interventions aimed at extending human healthspan.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is organized around three central aims, each designed to address fundamental questions about the emergent nature of aging. Our overarching goal is to move beyond tissue-specific descriptions to uncover universal principles of aging at the level of cellular ecosystems. 

**Aim 1: Develop a robust, scalable computational framework for the pan-tissue, cross-species integration of public single-cell aging data.** This aim addresses the primary technical barrier to a systems-level understanding of aging.
*   **Research Question 1.1:** How can we effectively disentangle true biological aging signals from confounding technical variables (e.g., study-specific batch effects, dissociation protocols, sequencing platforms) across hundreds of heterogeneous single-cell datasets?
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a hierarchical, deep learning-based integration strategy will significantly outperform current linear or shallow non-linear methods. By first correcting batch effects within tissues and then using a transfer learning approach to project all data into a shared latent space, our framework will maximally preserve cell-type identity and subtle age-related state transitions while minimizing technical artifacts. We will validate this by demonstrating superior performance on established integration metrics (e.g., Local Inverse Simpson's Index for batch mixing, Adjusted Rand Index for label conservation) compared to standard pipelines.

**Aim 2: Define and validate consensus, cross-tissue molecular signatures of aging for major cell types.** This aim seeks to identify the fundamental, conserved changes that occur in specific cell types, regardless of their tissue environment.
*   **Research Question 2.1:** Do universal aging programs exist within conserved cell lineages (e.g., fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, macrophages) that are independent of their tissue of residence?
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that beyond tissue-specific adaptations, common cell types will exhibit a core set of age-associated changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility related to fundamental cellular processes like metabolic stress, proteostasis failure, and inflammatory response. We predict that our integrated atlas will reveal a 'pan-fibroblast' aging signature, for example, that is conserved across skin, lung, and heart, providing a more fundamental definition of cellular aging.
*   **Research Question 2.2:** How does cellular heterogeneity and plasticity change with age within a given cell type?
*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** We hypothesize that aging leads to a loss of cellular identity and an increase in transcriptional noise, resulting in the emergence of aberrant, dysfunctional cell sub-states. We predict that trajectory inference and heterogeneity analyses will reveal a 'blurring' of distinct functional cell states in aged tissues and the appearance of novel senescent-like or pro-fibrotic subpopulations that contribute to tissue decline. 

**Aim 3: Map the systemic rewiring of intercellular communication networks as an emergent driver of organismal aging.** This aim directly investigates aging as a property of the cellular ecosystem.
*   **Research Question 3.1:** Which specific signaling pathways and ligand-receptor interactions are consistently gained, lost, or altered across disparate aging tissues, and which cell types are the primary drivers of these changes?
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that a key emergent property of aging is a systemic shift from tissue-specific, homeostatic signaling to a convergent, chronic pro-inflammatory communication network (inflammaging). We predict that computational inference of cell-cell communication will reveal a conserved gain of signaling mediated by TNF, IL-1, and IL-6, and a concomitant loss of regenerative signaling (e.g., Wnt, FGF), primarily driven by activated immune and stromal cell populations across multiple tissues.
*   **Research Question 3.2:** Can we identify 'keystone' cell types or communication hubs whose dysregulation has a disproportionately large impact on the entire tissue ecosystem?
*   **Hypothesis 3.2:** We hypothesize that specific cell populations, such as senescent fibroblasts or a subset of tissue-resident macrophages, act as central, pathological signaling hubs in aged tissues. We predict that network analysis of the inferred communication graphs will identify these cell types as having the highest centrality scores in aged tissues, and that their specific ligand emissions are the primary drivers of age-related transcriptional changes in neighboring epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells.

Methods And Approach

This project will exclusively synthesize publicly available data, requiring a transdisciplinary team and a robust computational infrastructure that necessitates NCEMS support. Our approach is structured around our three research aims and a detailed project timeline.

**Data Acquisition, Curation, and Standardization**
Our working group will systematically query major public repositories, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, the Single Cell Portal, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Data Coordination Platform, and the GTEx Portal. We will focus on scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets from human and mouse tissues with clearly annotated chronological age information (e.g., 'young' vs. 'old' cohorts). A critical first step, requiring a collaborative effort, will be the development of a unified metadata schema. We will manually curate and standardize all available sample- and cell-level information, including species, tissue, age, sex, experimental protocol, and original author-provided cell annotations. This standardized metadata is essential for downstream modeling and interpretation and represents a significant contribution in itself.

**Aim 1: Computational Integration Framework**
Our analytical pipeline will begin with a standardized pre-processing workflow for each dataset, including quality control, normalization (e.g., SCTransform for RNA, TF-IDF for ATAC), and feature selection. For integration, we will develop a novel, three-stage hierarchical approach:
1.  **Intra-Tissue Integration:** For each tissue with multiple available datasets (e.g., mouse lung), we will first use an established method like Harmony to correct for study-specific batch effects, creating a harmonized representation for that single tissue.
2.  **Cross-Tissue, Single-Cell-Type Integration:** We will then develop a more powerful, non-linear integration model based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). For each major cell type (e.g., fibroblasts), we will train a CVAE to learn a latent space that is conditioned on tissue identity but is invariant to technical batch effects. This allows us to directly compare, for example, a lung fibroblast to a skin fibroblast.
3.  **Pan-Atlas Assembly:** Finally, we will use a transfer learning approach to project all cell-type-specific latent spaces into a global, shared embedding. This final atlas will allow for comparisons across both cell types and tissues.
We will rigorously benchmark this framework against state-of-the-art methods using quantitative metrics for batch correction (kBET, LISI) and biological conservation (cell type ARI, silhouette width). This methodological development is a core component of the project.

**Aim 2: Defining Consensus Aging Signatures**
With the integrated atlas, we will first establish a consistent, cross-dataset cell type ontology. This will involve a combination of automated annotation tools (e.g., Azimuth, SingleR) followed by manual review and refinement by the domain experts within our working group. To identify aging signatures, we will employ pseudo-bulk differential expression (DE) and differential accessibility (DA) analyses, aggregating counts for each cell type within each biological sample. This approach allows the use of robust statistical models like DESeq2 and limma that properly account for inter-individual variability. A 'core' aging signature for a cell type will be defined as genes or chromatin regions that are significantly altered with age in the same direction across at least three distinct tissues. We will use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and other pathway tools to determine the biological functions of these core signatures. To analyze changes in heterogeneity, we will quantify transcriptional variance and use trajectory inference tools (e.g., scVelo, Palantir) to map age-associated shifts in cell state landscapes.

**Aim 3: Mapping Intercellular Communication Networks**
We will leverage the harmonized gene expression data to infer intercellular signaling. We will apply a suite of algorithms, including CellChat, NicheNet, and scConnect, which use ligand-receptor expression databases to predict the strength and targets of communication pathways between all cell types. By comparing the inferred networks between young and old atlas subsets, we will perform differential network analysis to identify signaling pathways that are consistently gained or lost with age across tissues. We will then use graph theory metrics (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality) to identify 'keystone' cell types that act as major signaling hubs in the aged communication network. The predictions from this analysis will generate specific, testable hypotheses about the drivers of tissue-level decline.

**Timeline and Milestones**
*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition and metadata standardization completed. Development and benchmarking of the integration framework (Aim 1). Release of a pilot atlas integrating 3-4 key tissues. Publication on the integration methodology.
*   **Year 2:** Completion of the full pan-tissue, cross-species atlas. Consensus cell type annotation finalized. Identification and initial characterization of core aging signatures for major cell types (Aim 2). Development of the public web portal begins.
*   **Year 3:** Comprehensive cell-cell communication network analysis (Aim 3). Final synthesis of all findings. Launch of the interactive 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging' web portal. Submission of the main atlas manuscript to a high-impact journal. Host a community-wide training workshop.

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is designed to be transformative, producing novel biological insights, powerful new methodologies, and a foundational resource for the scientific community, directly aligning with the NCEMS mission to catalyze multidisciplinary synthesis research.

**Intended Contributions to the Field**
1.  **A Foundational Public Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' an open-access, interactive web portal. This resource will allow any researcher, regardless of computational expertise, to explore the effects of aging on any major cell type across a wide range of tissues and species. It will serve as a central hypothesis-generation engine for the entire aging research community, analogous to the impact of resources like the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or the Human Cell Atlas (HCA).
2.  **A Paradigm Shift in Aging Biology:** Our work will provide the first comprehensive, systems-level view of aging as an emergent property of deteriorating cellular ecosystems. By identifying consensus, pan-tissue aging signatures and mapping the systemic rewiring of cell-cell communication, we will move the field beyond a cell-intrinsic focus. This will establish a new conceptual framework for understanding how molecular damage translates into organismal decline, revealing the ecological principles that govern tissue homeostasis and its failure with age.
3.  **Methodological Advancement in Computational Biology:** The hierarchical deep learning framework we develop for data integration will represent a significant advance for the analysis of large-scale, heterogeneous single-cell data. This open-source tool will be broadly applicable to other complex biological questions that require the synthesis of disparate public datasets, extending its impact beyond aging research.

**Broader Impacts and Applications**
*   **Therapeutic Development:** By identifying the most conserved molecular pathways and central 'keystone' cell types that drive aging across multiple organs, our atlas will pinpoint the highest-priority targets for pro-longevity interventions. Therapeutics targeting a pan-tissue mechanism are more likely to have systemic benefits and improve overall healthspan, rather than targeting a single disease in isolation. For example, identifying a specific signaling pathway from senescent fibroblasts that disrupts endothelial function across all tissues would nominate that pathway as a prime target for novel senotherapeutics.
*   **Biomarker Discovery:** The core aging signatures we define for accessible cell types (e.g., immune cells in the blood) can serve as the basis for developing highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of biological age. Such biomarkers are urgently needed to assess the efficacy of anti-aging interventions in clinical trials.

**Dissemination, Open Science, and Sustainability**
We are fully committed to open science principles. All analysis code will be version-controlled and publicly available on GitHub. All processed data objects, standardized metadata, and results will be deposited in FAIR-compliant repositories like Zenodo and Figshare. Our findings will be disseminated through high-impact publications (targeting journals like *Cell*, *Nature*, and *Science* for the main atlas and *Nature Methods* for the computational framework), and presentations at international conferences. The long-term sustainability of the web portal will be ensured through its integration with established platforms and by seeking follow-up funding to maintain and expand the atlas as new data becomes available.

**Training and Collaboration**
The project structure as an NCEMS Working Group is essential for its success. It brings together a diverse team of gerontologists, computational scientists, and systems biologists, fostering the cross-disciplinary collaboration required to tackle this challenge. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of this effort, receiving unique, hands-on training at the intersection of data science, genomics, and aging biology, thereby cultivating the next generation of data-savvy biomedical researchers as mandated by the research call.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis effort whose scope, complexity, and collaborative nature extend far beyond the capabilities of a single research lab or existing collaboration. Support from NCEMS is therefore essential for its success. The budget is designed to support the personnel, computational infrastructure, and collaborative activities required to build and disseminate this foundational resource.

**Personnel ($650,000)**
The primary cost is for dedicated personnel with the diverse expertise needed for this project. This team will form the core of the Working Group's analytical effort.
*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2):** $280,000. One fellow with expertise in computational biology and machine learning will lead the development of the integration framework. A second fellow with a background in systems biology and gerontology will lead the biological interpretation, pathway analysis, and cell-cell communication modeling.
*   **Graduate Students (2):** $180,000. Two students will support the massive effort of data acquisition, metadata curation, and execution of specific analytical pipelines, while receiving unparalleled cross-disciplinary training.
*   **Data Scientist/Software Engineer (0.5 FTE):** $120,000. This is a critical role that is not available in most academic labs. This individual will be responsible for building the robust, user-friendly web portal for the 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' managing the underlying database, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the resource.
*   **Principal Investigators:** $70,000. Summer salary support for the PIs to provide dedicated oversight and scientific direction.

**Computational Resources ($100,000)**
The scale of this project—integrating millions of cells from hundreds of datasets—requires substantial computational power. Training and benchmarking deep learning models is computationally intensive and requires significant GPU resources. While university HPC clusters are available, their queue times and resource limits are not conducive to rapid, iterative model development. We request funds for cloud computing credits (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) to provide on-demand access to GPU nodes for model training and to host the final, publicly accessible web portal. This cost is a primary reason why such a project cannot be undertaken by an individual lab.

**Meetings and Travel ($60,000)**
To foster the deep, synergistic collaboration that is the hallmark of an NCEMS Working Group, we will hold twice-yearly, in-person meetings of the entire team. These meetings are essential for data interpretation, strategic planning, and synthesizing diverse perspectives. Funds are also allocated for travel to one major international conference per year for trainees and PIs to present our findings and engage with the broader scientific community.

**Training and Dissemination ($40,000)**
We have budgeted funds to host an annual open workshop in Year 3 to train the wider research community on how to use the atlas and our analytical tools. This directly supports the NCEMS goal of training a data-savvy workforce. Funds are also included for open-access publication fees to ensure our results are freely and immediately available to all.

This 3D architecture is not random; it is a key regulator of gene expression, and its disruption is a hallmark of many diseases. This project will address the fundamental question of how the 1D epigenome sequence 'codes' for the emergent 3D chromatin structure. We propose to build a unified, predictive model of genome folding by synthesizing massive public datasets and fostering a novel collaboration between polymer physicists, bioinformaticians, and molecular biologists. Our working group will integrate genome-wide 3D architecture data (Hi-C, from 4DN and ENCODE), 1D epigenomic data (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq), and transcriptional data (RNA-seq) across hundreds of cell types and developmental states. The core of the project is to develop a new generation of data-constrained polymer physics models. We will use machine learning to learn the 'rules' that map specific combinations of histone modifications and protein binding sites to physical parameters in the model, such as local stiffness or interaction affinity. This hybrid AI-physics approach will allow us to simulate how the genome folds and predict how specific epigenomic alterations (e.g., in cancer) lead to changes in 3D structure and emergent gene expression patterns. The complexity of the models and the sheer scale of the data require a concerted effort beyond any single lab. This project will deliver a powerful, open-source simulation engine for the 4D nucleome, transforming our understanding of chromatin from a static blueprint to a dynamic, programmable matter. It will provide fundamental insights into the physical basis of gene regulation and train a new generation of scientists fluent in both the language of biology and physics.",,"Background And Significance

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information, but it is now clear that this process is profoundly regulated by the physical organization of the genome in three-dimensional space. The packaging of a two-meter long DNA polymer into a nucleus mere microns in diameter is not merely a feat of compaction; it is a dynamic, functional architecture that orchestrates gene expression programs essential for cellular identity and function. The advent of chromosome conformation capture technologies, particularly Hi-C, has revolutionized our understanding of this 3D genome, revealing a hierarchical organization of chromosome territories, A/B compartments corresponding to active and inactive chromatin, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), and specific chromatin loops that connect distal enhancers to their target promoters. Large-scale public consortia, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Program, have generated an unprecedented wealth of data, mapping this 3D architecture alongside 1D epigenomic features—such as histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and protein binding sites—across a vast array of cell types and developmental stages. This data deluge presents a historic opportunity to move beyond descriptive characterizations and address a fundamental, unresolved question: what are the physical principles that govern genome folding? How does the linear sequence of epigenomic marks 'program' the emergent 3D structure? Current theoretical models have provided crucial, yet incomplete, insights. Polymer physics models, such as the Strings and Binders model and the Loop Extrusion model, have successfully explained general features like TAD formation through the action of architectural proteins like CTCF and cohesin. However, these models often rely on a small set of manually-tuned parameters and struggle to capture the cell-type-specific nuances driven by the complex combinatorial code of the epigenome. On the other end of the spectrum, recent machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting Hi-C contact maps from 1D sequence and epigenomic data. Models like Akita and Orca can learn complex patterns but operate largely as 'black boxes,' offering limited mechanistic insight into the underlying physical forces. They predict what the structure looks like, but not why it adopts that conformation. This leaves a critical gap in our knowledge: a unified, predictive, and physically interpretable framework that directly links the 'cause' (the 1D epigenome) to the 'effect' (the 3D structure and its functional consequences). We lack a quantitative 'dictionary' that translates specific combinations of histone modifications and protein binding events into effective physical parameters like local compaction, stiffness, or interaction energies. Bridging this gap is not only a grand challenge in fundamental biology but also holds immense translational potential. Misregulation of the 3D genome is increasingly recognized as a driver of human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Many disease-associated genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in non-coding regions and are thought to function by altering enhancer-promoter loops. Without a predictive model of genome folding, interpreting the functional impact of these variants remains a formidable challenge. This research is therefore exceptionally timely. The availability of massive, harmonized public datasets, coupled with advances in computational power and hybrid AI-physics modeling techniques, creates the perfect conditions for a community-scale synthesis effort. By bringing together a transdisciplinary team of polymer physicists, computer scientists, bioinformaticians, and molecular biologists, this project will tackle this challenge head-on. We aim to build the first generalizable, data-constrained physical model of the genome, transforming our view of chromatin from a static scaffold to a dynamic, programmable matter, and ultimately uncovering the physical basis of gene regulation in health and disease.

Research Questions And Hypotheses

This project is driven by the overarching scientific question: How does the linear, 1D landscape of epigenomic marks and architectural protein binding sites encode the physical rules that govern the emergent, functional 3D folding of the genome? To deconstruct this complex problem, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with a corresponding set of testable hypotheses. Our approach is designed to systematically build a predictive framework, validate its accuracy, and apply it to uncover novel biological insights.

**Research Question 1: Can we derive a generalizable, quantitative mapping between local epigenomic states and the effective physical parameters of a polymer model of chromatin?**
This question addresses the core challenge of creating a 'dictionary' that translates biological information into physical properties. We aim to move beyond ad-hoc parameterization and learn these rules directly from data.
*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A deep learning model, trained on a diverse compendium of cell types, can learn a robust function that maps a high-dimensional vector of 1D epigenomic features (e.g., levels of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, CTCF binding) to a low-dimensional set of physical parameters (e.g., monomer type, interaction energy, local stiffness) for a coarse-grained polymer simulation.
*   **Prediction:** We predict this learned mapping will be biologically interpretable. For instance, genomic regions enriched for active marks like H3K4me3 and H3K27ac will be assigned parameters that promote self-association and phase separation, consistent with the formation of active A compartments. Conversely, regions with repressive marks like H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 will be assigned parameters promoting a different type of self-association, forming B compartments. CTCF binding sites will be mapped to parameters that create strong, directional loop anchors.
*   **Validation:** The generalizability of this mapping will be tested via rigorous cross-validation. The model will be trained on a large subset of cell types (~80%) and its ability to predict the 3D genome architecture of held-out cell types (~20%) from their 1D epigenome alone will be quantified by comparing simulated and experimental Hi-C maps.

**Research Question 2: How accurately can our data-inferred, physics-based model predict de novo changes in 3D genome organization in response to specific molecular perturbations?**
This question tests the predictive power and mechanistic validity of our model. A truly robust model should not only recapitulate static structures but also predict how they change when the system is perturbed.
*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** Our hybrid AI-physics model will accurately predict the structural consequences of depleting key architectural proteins, such as CTCF or cohesin subunits (e.g., RAD21). 
*   **Prediction:** Simulating CTCF depletion (by removing the specific interaction parameters associated with CTCF sites) will result in a quantifiable loss of TAD insulation and a blurring of domain boundaries in the simulated Hi-C maps. This will manifest as an increase in the insulation score and a decrease in intra-TAD contact frequency, mirroring published experimental results from degron-based studies. The model's predictions will be quantitatively superior to those from models with fixed, non-data-driven parameters.
*   **Validation:** We will leverage publicly available Hi-C datasets from experiments where specific proteins were acutely depleted. We will compare the difference between our simulated perturbed and unperturbed contact maps with the difference between the experimental perturbed and unperturbed maps.

**Research Question 3: Can the model reveal how epigenomic dysregulation in disease states, such as cancer, leads to pathogenic alterations in 3D genome architecture and gene expression?**
This question applies our predictive framework to a critical biomedical problem, aiming to link genotype and epigenotype to phenotype through the lens of 3D genome structure.
*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** Our model can predict aberrant enhancer-promoter contacts in cancer cells based on their altered epigenomic landscapes, and these novel contacts will correlate with the misexpression of key oncogenes or tumor suppressors.
*   **Prediction:** For a cancer cell line with a known amplification of a distal enhancer, our model, when provided with the corresponding epigenomic data (e.g., ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq), will predict the formation of a new, strong chromatin loop connecting this enhancer to an oncogene promoter. This predicted structural change will be associated with a corresponding increase in the oncogene's expression level, as observed in matched RNA-seq data.
*   **Validation:** We will use matched epigenomic, 3D genomic, and transcriptomic data from cancer cell lines and primary tumors available through consortia like TCGA and CCLE. We will systematically compare our model's predictions of structural rewiring with observed changes in gene expression, identifying statistically significant correlations that point to novel mechanisms of oncogene activation.

Methods And Approach

Our research plan is structured into three synergistic Aims, designed to systematically collect and harmonize data, develop and train our novel modeling framework, and validate its predictive power. This project exclusively utilizes publicly available data, and its success hinges on the collaborative synthesis of expertise from our multidisciplinary working group.

**Aim 1: Curation, Harmonization, and Integration of a Multi-modal Public Data Compendium.**
The foundation of this project is a comprehensive, consistently processed dataset integrating 1D epigenomics, 3D genomics, and transcriptomics. This large-scale data harmonization effort is beyond the scope of a single lab and is a key justification for the working group structure.
*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically mine major public repositories, including the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Data Portal, the ENCODE Portal, the Cistrome Data Browser, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
*   **Data Types and Selection:** We will assemble a diverse collection of datasets from approximately 200 human and mouse cell lines, covering a wide range of developmental stages, tissues, and disease states. This includes:
    1.  **3D Genomics:** High-resolution in situ Hi-C and Micro-C data to serve as the ground truth for 3D architecture.
    2.  **1D Epigenomics:** ChIP-seq data for a core set of histone modifications (activating: H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac; repressive: H3K9me3, H3K27me3; elongation: H3K36me3), architectural proteins (CTCF, RAD21, SMC3), and key transcription factors.
    3.  **Chromatin Accessibility:** ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data.
    4.  **Transcription:** RNA-seq and/or GRO-seq data to quantify gene expression.
*   **Processing Pipeline:** To ensure consistency, all raw data will be reprocessed through a unified, containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipeline. Hi-C data will be processed using HiC-Pro and normalized using iterative correction and equilibration (ICE). ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data will be processed using ENCODE standard pipelines. All data will be mapped to the latest reference genome builds (hg38/mm10). The final output will be a multi-modal data tensor where each genomic bin (e.g., 10 kb resolution) is annotated with a feature vector comprising its full epigenomic and transcriptional state.

**Aim 2: Development and Training of a Hybrid AI-Physics Simulation Engine.**
This Aim constitutes the core technical innovation of the project, where we will build a new class of predictive model.
*   **Polymer Physics Framework:** We will implement a coarse-grained bead-spring polymer model using highly efficient simulation engines like OpenMM or LAMMPS, which can leverage GPU acceleration. Each bead will represent a genomic region (e.g., 10 kb), and the model will include potentials for chain connectivity, excluded volume, and specific, non-covalent interactions.
*   **Machine Learning Architecture:** We will develop a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the mapping from the 1D epigenomic feature vector of a genomic bin to the physical parameters of the corresponding bead in the polymer model. The output of the DNN will define the bead's 'type' or 'color', which in turn dictates its interaction energies with other bead types. This allows for a rich, data-driven parameterization of the physical model. For example, the model can learn that beads with high H3K27ac levels strongly attract each other.
*   **Differentiable Training Loop:** A key challenge is to train the DNN based on the output of the polymer simulation. We will employ a novel training strategy that makes the entire pipeline differentiable. The polymer simulation will be run for a set number of steps to generate a simulated contact map. A loss function (e.g., stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient) will quantify the difference between the simulated and experimental Hi-C maps. We will use techniques from differentiable physics or reinforcement learning (e.g., policy gradients) to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the DNN's parameters, allowing for end-to-end training via backpropagation. This computationally intensive task requires significant HPC resources and the combined expertise of our physics and computer science team members.

**Aim 3: Model Validation, Perturbation Analysis, and Disease Application.**
In this Aim, we will rigorously test our model's predictions and apply it to generate novel biological hypotheses.
*   **Cross-Cell-Type Validation:** As described in Hypothesis 1.1, we will perform k-fold cross-validation, training the model on a subset of cell types and testing its ability to predict the 3D structure of held-out cell types from their 1D epigenome alone. This will assess the model's generalizability.
*   **In Silico Perturbation Experiments:** We will use public Hi-C data from experiments involving the acute depletion of proteins like CTCF, WAPL, or cohesin. We will simulate these perturbations by modifying the model's parameters accordingly (e.g., removing CTCF-mediated loop anchor interactions) and compare the predicted changes in contact maps to the experimental data. This provides a stringent test of the model's mechanistic basis.
*   **Cancer Genome Modeling:** We will apply the fully trained model to cancer cell lines with well-characterized epigenomic alterations (e.g., from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia). We will generate de novo predictions of 3D genome rewiring and correlate these predicted structural changes (e.g., new enhancer-promoter loops) with observed differential gene expression from matched RNA-seq data, thereby generating testable hypotheses about mechanisms of oncogene activation.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
*   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and harmonization pipeline (M6). Develop and benchmark the polymer simulation and ML framework (M12). First working group in-person meeting (M3).
*   **Year 2:** Complete training of the first-generation model on the full dataset (M18). Perform cross-cell-type validation and initial in silico perturbation experiments (M24). Release beta version of the open-source software (M24).
*   **Year 3:** Conduct comprehensive cancer genome modeling studies (M30). Finalize and publish the simulation engine and the primary scientific findings (M36). Host a community training workshop (M36).

Expected Outcomes And Impact

This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of molecular and cellular biology, genomics, and computational biology. The impact will span from fundamental scientific understanding to potential translational applications, while also building a lasting community resource and training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**
The primary outcome of this research will be a paradigm shift in how we understand and study genome organization. We will move the field from a descriptive phase, cataloging chromatin structures, to a predictive and mechanistic one.
1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of Genome Folding:** We will deliver the first generalizable, physics-based simulation engine that can accurately predict the 3D genome architecture of a mammalian cell solely from its 1D epigenomic profile. This represents a 'holy grail' for the field and will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generating tool for the entire research community.
2.  **The 'Epigenetic-to-Physical' Rulebook:** Our hybrid AI-physics approach will produce a quantitative mapping—a 'dictionary'—that translates the combinatorial language of histone modifications and protein binding into the physical forces that shape the genome. This will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into how the cell leverages the epigenome to control its physical state and, consequently, its function.
3.  **Novel Insights into Gene Regulation:** By simulating genome folding in diverse cellular contexts, including development and disease, our model will uncover novel principles of long-range gene regulation. It will allow us to systematically probe how changes in chromatin state lead to the formation or dissolution of enhancer-promoter loops, providing a physical basis for understanding gene expression dynamics.

**Broader Impacts and Applications:**
The impact of our work will extend far beyond basic science.
1.  **Interpreting Disease-Associated Genetic Variation:** A major challenge in human genetics is interpreting the function of the ~98% of disease-associated variants that lie in non-coding regions. Our simulation engine will provide a revolutionary tool to address this. By simulating the effects of a non-coding variant on the local epigenome, we can predict its impact on 3D looping and gene regulation, providing a mechanistic link from genotype to phenotype for diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
2.  **Advancing Synthetic Biology and Genome Engineering:** The ability to predictively model genome folding opens the door to forward engineering, or 'genome programming.' Our framework could guide the design of synthetic epigenomes using tools like dCas9-fused epigenetic editors to create bespoke 3D structures, thereby controlling gene expression programs for therapeutic or biotechnological applications.
3.  **A Lasting Community Resource:** We are committed to Open Science principles. The entire simulation framework, including all code, trained models, and processed data, will be made publicly available through a user-friendly, well-documented open-source platform (e.g., on GitHub and Zenodo). We will provide containerized versions (Docker/Singularity) to ensure reproducibility and ease of use. This will democratize access to sophisticated 4D nucleome modeling.

**Dissemination and Training:**
We will pursue a multi-pronged dissemination strategy. Key scientific findings will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Nature, Cell, Science). The computational methods and software will be published in specialized journals (e.g., Nature Methods, Nature Computational Science). We will present our work at major international conferences (e.g., Gordon Research Conferences, Keystone Symposia, ISMB). Crucially, this project is designed as a training vehicle. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the collaboration, gaining unique, transdisciplinary skills at the interface of biology, physics, and computer science. We will host an annual virtual workshop, open to the community, to train other researchers on how to use our tools and approach.

**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**
Our long-term vision is to establish a collaborative, computational hub for the 4D nucleome. The framework developed in this project will be extensible, designed to incorporate new data types (e.g., single-cell Hi-C, live-cell imaging) and more sophisticated modeling approaches as they become available. The working group formed through this NCEMS award will build lasting collaborative relationships, positioning us to secure future funding (e.g., NIH U-series grants) to sustain and expand this community resource long after the initial funding period.

Budget And Resources

The proposed research represents a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory or existing collaboration. The sheer scale of the data integration, the computational intensity of the hybrid AI-physics models, and the requirement for deep, synergistic expertise from disparate scientific fields necessitate the support and resources provided by the NCEMS program. Our budget is designed to support the personnel, computational infrastructure, and collaborative activities essential for the project's success.

This role is crucial for the logistical success of a multi-lab collaboration.

**Computational Resources (Total: $XX,XXX):**
The training of our hybrid AI-physics model is exceptionally computationally demanding, requiring thousands of GPU hours. This is far beyond the typical resources of an academic lab.
*   **Cloud Computing / HPC Access:** We request significant funds for purchasing compute time on a commercial cloud platform (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) or for access to a national high-performance computing (HPC) facility. This will be used for the end-to-end training of the deep learning model coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, as well as for storing and processing the petabyte-scale public datasets.

**Justification for NCEMS Support:**
This project is uniquely aligned with the NCEMS mission. It is a pure data synthesis project that does not generate new experimental data. The scientific question—uncovering the physical code of genome folding—is fundamental and requires integrating diverse datasets at a scale no single lab could manage. Our team was specifically assembled for this proposal, bringing together world leaders in polymer physics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and molecular biology who have not previously collaborated in this manner. The required computational resources and dedicated project management are substantial. NCEMS support is therefore not just beneficial but essential to catalyze this collaboration and enable a project of this ambition and potential impact.",,
