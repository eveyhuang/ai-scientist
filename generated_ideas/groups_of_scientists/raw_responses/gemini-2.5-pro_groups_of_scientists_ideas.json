This identity is encoded not in the DNA sequence itself, but in the dynamic, multi-layered epigenome. We propose to form a working group to address the hypothesis that a 'chromatin grammar'—a set of combinatorial rules governing the interplay of DNA accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding—dictates cellular identity as an emergent property. This project will synthesize a vast repository of publicly available single-cell and bulk functional genomics data, including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, and RNA-seq from consortia like ENCODE, the Human Cell Atlas, and Roadmap Epigenomics. Our multidisciplinary team, comprising computational biologists, chromatin experts, developmental biologists, and machine learning specialists, will develop a novel integrative framework. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including graph neural networks and transformers, we will move beyond simple correlations to build predictive models that can infer cell type from chromatin state alone and simulate cell fate transitions. The project will deliver a publicly accessible 'Chromatin State Atlas' and a computational model of the emergent logic of cell identity. This work will provide profound insights into development, disease (like cancer, where identity is lost), and regenerative medicine, while training a new generation of scientists in large-scale data synthesis and modeling.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Deconstructing Allostery: Mapping the Emergent Communication Networks of Macromolecular Machines\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Allostery, the process by which a binding event at one site of a protein or complex affects a distant functional site, is a quintessential emergent property that underpins cellular regulation. However, the pathways of allosteric communication through large, dynamic macromolecular machines like the ribosome, proteasome, or spliceosome remain poorly understood. This working group will pioneer a community-scale effort to create a unified 'Allosteric Atlas' by systematically mapping these communication networks. We will not generate new experimental data, but instead integrate and synthesize three major public data types: 1) thousands of static structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) to build structural ensembles; 2) deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to identify functionally coupled residues; and 3) molecular dynamics simulation trajectories to capture conformational dynamics. Our team, uniting structural biologists, biophysicists, computer scientists, and biochemists, will develop novel computational methods based on network theory and information theory to trace the flow of information through these complexes. The goal is to build predictive models that can identify cryptic allosteric sites, forecast the functional consequences of mutations (including those associated with disease), and guide the rational design of allosteric drugs. This project will transform our understanding of molecular regulation from a one-site-at-a-time view to a holistic, network-based perspective.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"In Silico Origins: The Emergence of Autocatalytic Metabolic Networks from Prebiotic Chemistry\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The transition from a non-living chemical environment to the first self-sustaining, metabolizing life form is one of the greatest unsolved puzzles in science. This emergence of life was likely predicated on the formation of autocatalytic chemical networks capable of self-replication and evolution. This working group proposes a novel, purely computational approach to explore the plausible pathways for the emergence of primordial metabolism. We will synthesize and integrate disparate public data sources into a unified 'Prebiotic Chemical Universe' knowledge base. This includes: 1) comprehensive chemical reaction data from databases like KEGG and Rhea; 2) quantum chemistry calculations on the feasibility of prebiotic reactions; and 3) metabolomics data from diverse extant organisms to identify conserved core metabolic motifs. Our transdisciplinary team of systems biologists, computational chemists, evolutionary theorists, and astrobiologists will employ network expansion algorithms and principles from chemical engineering to simulate the growth of chemical networks from simple precursor molecules. We will search for the spontaneous emergence of autocatalytic cycles, identify key molecular 'scaffolds' that enable network complexity, and determine the minimal conditions required for a self-propagating metabolic system. This project will provide a principled, data-driven framework for generating testable hypotheses about the origin of life and the fundamental principles governing the emergence of biological complexity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Cancer Kinome's Emergent Logic: Predicting Therapeutic Resistance and Plasticity through Network Synthesis\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The ability of cancer cells to resist targeted therapies and adapt to treatment is an emergent property of their rewired signaling networks. The protein kinome, a network of over 500 kinases, is a central hub for this rewiring, yet its complexity makes therapeutic responses difficult to predict. This working group will address this challenge by building dynamic, context-specific models of the cancer kinome. We will synthesize a massive collection of public data, including phosphoproteomics, genomics, and transcriptomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), alongside drug sensitivity data from the GDSC and CTRP databases for thousands of cancer cell lines. Our team, composed of cancer biologists, systems biologists, bioinformaticians, and clinical pharmacologists, will develop a machine learning framework to learn the rules of kinome rewiring in different cancer subtypes and in response to specific kinase inhibitors. The primary goal is to create predictive models that can identify emergent feedback loops and bypass pathways that lead to drug resistance before they arise. These models will be used to systematically predict synergistic drug combinations that can exploit network vulnerabilities and overcome the emergent robustness of the cancer kinome. This project will produce a powerful open-source platform for in silico drug screening and hypothesis generation, accelerating the development of more durable cancer therapies.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Sociomicrobiology: Modeling the Emergence of Gut Ecosystem Function from Community-Scale Metabolic Interactions\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem whose collective metabolic activities profoundly impact host health. These activities are not the sum of individual microbes but are emergent properties arising from a dense web of metabolic competition, cross-feeding, and collaboration. This working group aims to decipher the principles governing the emergence of community-level function in the gut microbiome. We will integrate and synthesize multi-omic data from the world's largest public microbiome repositories, including the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the American Gut Project. This includes metagenomic data to identify community composition, metatranscriptomic data to assess gene activity, and metabolomic data to measure metabolic outputs. Our diverse team, including microbial ecologists, systems biologists, computer scientists, and nutritionists, will go beyond simple taxonomic cataloging. We will employ novel computational pipelines to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models for thousands of microbial species and assemble them into community-scale models. Using ecological theory and flux balance analysis, we will simulate nutrient flow, identify keystone species and metabolic handoffs, and predict how the system responds to perturbations like diet shifts or antibiotic administration. The project will deliver a dynamic, predictive model of the gut ecosystem, providing a framework for understanding dysbiosis and designing precision interventions (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics) to rationally engineer this critical emergent system.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Cracking the Splicing Code: A Deep Learning Approach to the Emergence of Proteomic Diversity\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA allows a limited number of genes to produce a vast repertoire of protein isoforms, a key source of biological complexity. The 'splicing code' that governs this process—the set of rules by which cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) guide the spliceosome to generate tissue-specific isoform patterns—remains elusive. This working group will tackle this grand challenge by treating the splicing code as a language to be learned from data. We will synthesize petabytes of public data, including: 1) RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and single-cell atlases to quantify isoform expression across thousands of samples; 2) eCLIP-seq data from ENCODE to map RBP binding sites; and 3) RNA structure probing data to understand the role of local RNA conformation. Our team, bringing together RNA biologists, computational linguists, and machine learning experts, will develop and train a novel deep learning architecture, inspired by large language models like transformers. This model will learn the complex, combinatorial grammar of splicing directly from DNA/RNA sequence and the cellular context of RBP expression. The ultimate goal is a predictive tool that, given a gene sequence and a cell type, can accurately predict the resulting mRNA isoforms. This would revolutionize our ability to interpret genetic variants affecting splicing in disease and understand the emergence of proteomic diversity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Phase-Separation Atlas: Predicting the Emergence of Membraneless Organelles from Proteome-wide Features\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Cells organize their cytoplasm using not only membrane-bound organelles but also membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates, which form via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The composition, regulation, and material properties of these condensates are emergent phenomena driven by multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids. This working group will develop a predictive framework to map the 'phase-separation potential' of the entire human proteome. We will synthesize diverse public datasets, including protein sequences from UniProt, structural disorder predictions, post-translational modification sites, and protein-protein interaction networks from STRING and BioGRID. These data will be used to train machine learning models, benchmarked against curated experimental databases of phase-separating proteins (e.g., PhaSepDB, PhaSePro). Our multidisciplinary team of cell biologists, polymer physicists, biophysicists, and data scientists will develop a multi-scale model that predicts not only the intrinsic LLPS propensity of individual proteins but also the combinatorial logic of how these proteins assemble into specific, compositionally distinct condensates. The project will deliver a publicly accessible, interactive 'Phase-Separation Atlas' that predicts which proteins form condensates, with whom they interact, and how disease-associated mutations or post-translational modifications might alter these emergent cellular structures. This will provide a powerful resource for understanding cellular organization and the molecular basis of diseases like neurodegeneration and cancer.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Digital Cell: Unifying Image and Omics Data to Model the Emergence of Cellular Morphology\",\n      \"abstract\": \"A cell's shape and internal organization are fundamental to its function, yet they are emergent properties arising from staggeringly complex interactions between the cytoskeleton, membranes, and organelles. Understanding how morphology is robustly encoded and dynamically regulated requires a holistic, quantitative approach. This working group proposes to build a 'digital twin' of a human cell by integrating public data from two powerful but often disconnected domains: imaging and omics. We will synthesize 3D live-cell imaging data from resources like the Allen Cell Explorer and the Image Data Resource, which contain terabytes of high-resolution movies of fluorescently-tagged structures. We will combine this with proteomics, transcriptomics, and protein-protein interaction data that define the molecular parts list and their connections. Our team, uniting cell biologists, computer vision experts, biophysicists, and applied mathematicians, will develop novel deep learning algorithms to automatically extract a 'morphological feature space' from thousands of images. We will then build an integrated computational model that links these morphological features to the underlying molecular networks. The goal is to create a predictive model that can simulate how cellular morphology emerges from molecular-level rules and how it changes in response to genetic perturbations cataloged in resources like the DepMap. This will provide an unprecedented platform for understanding the principles of cellular self-organization.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"A Pan-Viral Synthesis of the Host-Pathogen Arms Race: Uncovering the Emergent Rules of Molecular Conflict\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The perpetual conflict between viruses and their hosts is a primary driver of molecular evolution, leading to the emergence of sophisticated host immune defenses and viral countermeasures. While individual examples are well-studied, the universal principles governing these molecular arms races remain poorly defined. This working group will perform the first comprehensive, pan-viral synthesis of host-virus evolution. We will integrate massive public datasets, including all available viral genomes from NCBI, hundreds of host genomes, and comprehensive databases of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions. Our team of virologists, evolutionary biologists, immunologists, and computational biologists will develop a powerful phylogenomic pipeline to systematically identify genes under positive selection—the molecular signatures of genetic conflict—across thousands of host-virus pairs. By mapping these rapidly evolving sites onto protein structures and interaction networks, we will uncover the emergent strategies of this conflict. We will identify conserved functional hotspots on host restriction factors targeted by diverse viral families and discover novel viral protein families dedicated to immune evasion. This project will produce a 'Molecular Conflict Atlas' that charts the evolutionary history and predicts future trajectories of host-virus interactions, providing a powerful framework for understanding viral emergence, pathogenesis, and the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Cellular Phenotype Project: Predicting Emergent Cellular Behavior by Integrating the Functional Genomics Universe\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The ultimate goal of cellular biology is to predict phenotype from genotype. Achieving this requires a systems-level understanding of how molecular components interact to produce emergent cellular behaviors. This working group proposes an audacious 'grand challenge' project: to build a single, unified computational model of a human cell by synthesizing the entirety of public functional genomics data. We will create a multi-layered knowledge graph integrating data from dozens of major consortia, including ENCODE (regulatory elements), GTEx (tissue-specific expression), the Human Protein Atlas (protein localization), DepMap (CRISPR-based gene dependencies), STRING/BioGRID (protein interactions), Reactome (pathways), and ChEMBL (drug-target data). This graph will represent the most comprehensive in silico model of a cell ever constructed. Our team, comprising world leaders in systems biology, large-scale data integration, and artificial intelligence, will then deploy cutting-edge graph neural networks and other AI methodologies to learn the emergent rules of cellular function from this integrated network. The model will be trained to predict the phenotypic consequences of perturbations, such as the system-wide effects of knocking out a gene or introducing a drug.
