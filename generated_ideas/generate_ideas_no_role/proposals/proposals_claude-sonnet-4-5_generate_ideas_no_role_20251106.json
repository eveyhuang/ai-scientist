        "background_and_significance": "Biomolecular condensates have revolutionized our understanding of cellular organization, revealing that cells utilize liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to create membraneless compartments that concentrate biomolecules and regulate biochemical reactions. Since the seminal discoveries linking intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to phase separation behavior in P granules and stress granules, the field has exploded with observations of hundreds of condensate-forming proteins involved in diverse cellular processes including transcription, RNA processing, signal transduction, and stress response. Despite this rapid progress, fundamental questions remain unanswered: What are the universal sequence features that encode phase separation propensity? How do post-translational modifications tune condensate properties? Why do certain proteins phase separate while closely related sequences do not? These questions are critical because aberrant phase transitions are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and aging.\n\nCurrent understanding of LLPS drivers has been largely derived from detailed studies of individual proteins such as FUS, hnRNPA1, and DDX4. These studies have identified key features including low-complexity domains enriched in specific amino acids (particularly glycine, serine, and aromatic residues), prion-like domains, and multivalent interaction motifs. However, this protein-by-protein approach has limitations. First, it provides limited predictive power for identifying novel phase-separating proteins across proteomes. Second, it obscures potential universal principles that govern LLPS across evolutionary timescales. Third, it fails to capture the complex interplay between sequence features, structural context, and cellular environment that determines phase behavior in vivo.\n\nRecent technological advances have generated unprecedented datasets that remain underutilized. High-throughput screens have identified hundreds of phase-separating proteins in human cells and model organisms. Proteome-wide studies using turbidity assays, optogenetic systems, and imaging approaches have mapped condensate composition under various cellular conditions. Structural biology has provided atomic-resolution insights into condensate-relevant interactions, while AlphaFold has predicted structures for millions of proteins, including disordered regions previously inaccessible to experimental methods. Simultaneously, databases like DisProt, PhaSePro, LLPSDB, and DrLLPS have catalogued experimentally validated phase-separating proteins and their properties. However, these datasets exist in isolation, analyzed within narrow disciplinary boundaries, preventing synthesis that could reveal emergent principles.\n\nThe significance of this synthesis project lies in its potential to transform LLPS research from descriptive to predictive science. By integrating diverse data types—sequences, structures, modifications, interaction networks, and experimental phase behavior—across thousands of proteins and multiple organisms, we can identify conserved \"grammatical rules\" that cells use to encode phase separation behavior. This is analogous to how comparative genomics revealed universal principles of gene regulation by analyzing regulatory sequences across species. Such a framework would enable prediction of disease-causing mutations, rational design of synthetic condensates for biotechnology, and understanding of how phase separation evolved as a regulatory mechanism.\n\nThis project is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exists in public repositories, having accumulated over the past five years of intensive LLPS research. Second, machine learning methods have matured to handle complex, multi-modal biological data, as demonstrated by successes in protein structure prediction and variant effect prediction. Third, the field has reached a critical juncture where descriptive studies are giving way to mechanistic and predictive frameworks, creating demand for comprehensive synthesis. Finally, the biomedical importance of understanding condensate dysfunction in disease provides urgent motivation for developing predictive tools that can identify pathogenic variants and therapeutic targets.\n\nThe collaborative, multidisciplinary nature of this project is essential and exceeds the capacity of individual laboratories. It requires expertise in biophysics to understand phase transition thermodynamics, computational biology to handle large-scale data integration, machine learning to develop predictive models, structural biology to interpret molecular interactions, cell biology to contextualize findings, and evolutionary biology to trace LLPS mechanisms across species. No single laboratory possesses this breadth of expertise or the computational infrastructure needed to process and integrate terabytes of structural, proteomic, and genomic data. This synthesis project exemplifies the community-scale approach needed to address fundamental questions in modern molecular biology.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to decode the universal principles governing protein phase separation.\n\nResearch Question 1: What are the conserved sequence features and compositional biases that predict phase separation propensity across the tree of life? We hypothesize that phase-separating proteins share quantifiable sequence signatures beyond simple amino acid composition, including specific k-mer patterns, charge distribution architectures, and spacing of interaction motifs. We predict that machine learning models trained on multi-species datasets will identify universal features present in organisms from bacteria to humans, as well as lineage-specific adaptations. Testing this hypothesis requires comprehensive analysis of experimentally validated phase-separating proteins from LLPSDB, PhaSePro, and DrLLPS databases, encompassing over 3,000 proteins across diverse taxa. We will extract hundreds of sequence features including amino acid composition, disorder propensity, charge patterning (using metrics like kappa and Omega), aromatic residue spacing, prion-like domain scores, and higher-order sequence motifs. Comparative analysis across phylogenetic groups will reveal conserved versus lineage-specific features. We expect to identify a core set of 20-30 features that are universally predictive, with additional organism-specific features reflecting evolutionary adaptations to different cellular environments.\n\nResearch Question 2: How do post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate phase separation behavior, and can we predict modification-dependent changes in condensate properties? We hypothesize that PTMs act as molecular switches that tune phase separation by altering charge distribution, introducing steric constraints, or creating/disrupting interaction sites. Specifically, we predict that phosphorylation sites cluster in regions flanking low-complexity domains, that arginine methylation preferentially occurs in RG-rich regions to modulate cation-pi interactions, and that ubiquitination sites correlate with condensate disassembly signals. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate PTM data from PhosphoSitePlus, UniProt, and iPTMnet with phase separation databases, analyzing over 50,000 modification sites on known phase-separating proteins. We will map PTM positions relative to sequence features identified in Question 1, assess enrichment patterns, and correlate modification states with experimentally measured changes in phase behavior from published datasets. Expected outcomes include PTM-aware predictive models that can forecast how specific modifications alter LLPS propensity, with validation against experimental studies showing modification-dependent condensate assembly/disassembly.\n\nResearch Question 3: What structural features and interaction modes drive phase separation, and how do predicted structures from AlphaFold inform our understanding of condensate formation? We hypothesize that phase separation depends not only on sequence but on conformational ensembles and transient structural elements that mediate multivalent interactions. We predict that AlphaFold confidence scores in disordered regions correlate with phase separation propensity, that predicted local structural elements (helices, beta-strands) in IDRs serve as interaction interfaces, and that spatial arrangement of folded domains relative to disordered regions influences condensate architecture. Testing requires integrating experimental structures from PDB with AlphaFold predictions for all known phase-separating proteins, analyzing over 200,000 structural models. We will extract features including secondary structure propensity in disordered regions, domain architecture, inter-domain linker properties, surface properties of folded domains, and predicted protein-protein interaction interfaces. Correlation with experimental phase behavior data will reveal structure-function relationships. We expect to demonstrate that structural context significantly improves prediction accuracy beyond sequence-only models, particularly for proteins with complex domain architectures.\n\nResearch Question 4: How has phase separation evolved as a regulatory mechanism, and what evolutionary pressures shaped the distribution of LLPS-prone proteins across cellular functions and organisms? We hypothesize that phase separation emerged early in evolution as a mechanism for spatial organization, with subsequent elaboration in eukaryotes coinciding with increased cellular complexity. We predict that prokaryotic phase-separating proteins are enriched in stress response functions, that eukaryotic innovations include nuclear condensates and signaling assemblies, and that LLPS-prone proteins show accelerated evolution in disordered regions while maintaining conserved interaction motifs. Testing requires phylogenetic analysis of phase-separating protein families across 100+ species spanning all domains of life, integrating data from OrthoDB, KEGG, and GO databases. We will trace the evolutionary origins of condensate-forming proteins, analyze functional enrichment patterns across taxa, assess sequence conservation and divergence rates, and correlate LLPS protein abundance with organismal complexity metrics. Expected outcomes include an evolutionary atlas showing when and how different classes of phase-separating proteins emerged, revealing principles of how cells evolved to exploit phase transitions for regulation.\n\nCollectively, these questions will be addressed through an iterative cycle of data integration, feature extraction, model development, and validation against held-out experimental datasets. Success will be measured by predictive accuracy (AUROC > 0.85 for binary LLPS classification), biological interpretability of identified features, and consistency of findings across independent datasets and organisms.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our synthesis approach integrates multiple data types through a systematic workflow organized into five interconnected phases over a 36-month timeline.\n\nPhase 1: Data Acquisition and Harmonization (Months 1-6). We will compile comprehensive datasets from public repositories: (1) Phase separation databases: LLPSDB (>500 experimentally validated proteins), PhaSePro (>1,000 entries with quantitative data), DrLLPS (>300 RNA-binding proteins), and literature-curated datasets from recent proteome-wide screens totaling 3,000+ phase-separating proteins across 50+ species.

Statistical analysis will identify feature correlations and reduce dimensionality using PCA and UMAP.\n\nPhase 3: Machine Learning Model Development (Months 10-24). We will develop multiple complementary models: (1) Binary classification models to predict LLPS propensity using gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), random forests, and deep neural networks. Training will use 80% of data with 5-fold cross-validation, testing on held-out 20%. (2) Multi-class models to predict condensate types (nuclear bodies, stress granules, P-bodies, etc.) using the same algorithms. (3) Regression models to predict quantitative properties (critical concentration, saturation concentration) where data exists. (4) Sequence-to-function models using transformer architectures (ProtBERT, ESM-2) fine-tuned on LLPS data to capture long-range sequence dependencies. (5) Ensemble models combining predictions from multiple algorithms. Model interpretation will use SHAP values to identify important features, attention visualization for transformers, and ablation studies. We will specifically test whether models trained on one organism generalize to others, assessing cross-species transferability. PTM-aware models will incorporate modification states as conditional inputs. Validation will use multiple metrics: AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, precision, recall, and Matthews correlation coefficient. We will benchmark against existing tools (catGRANULE, PSPredictor, FuzDrop) using identical test sets.\n\nPhase 4: Evolutionary and Comparative Analysis (Months 18-30). Phylogenetic analysis will trace LLPS protein evolution across 100+ species spanning bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We will construct phylogenetic trees for condensate-forming protein families using MAFFT alignment and RAxML/IQ-TREE. Ancestral sequence reconstruction using PAML will infer evolutionary trajectories of LLPS-relevant features. Functional enrichment analysis using GO and KEGG will identify lineage-specific adaptations. We will calculate dN/dS ratios to assess selection pressures on disordered versus ordered regions. Correlation analysis will test relationships between organismal complexity (genome size, cell type number, proteome size) and LLPS protein abundance. Network analysis will examine how phase-separating proteins integrate into cellular pathways across species. This analysis will generate an evolutionary atlas visualizing the emergence and diversification of phase separation mechanisms.\n\nPhase 5: Tool Development and Validation (Months 24-36). We will develop user-friendly tools: (1) Web server for LLPS prediction accepting protein sequences, providing propensity scores, confidence intervals, and feature importance visualizations. (2) PTM effect predictor for assessing how modifications alter phase behavior. (3) Mutation effect predictor for disease variant interpretation.

This represents a conceptual advance from descriptive to predictive understanding, analogous to how the genetic code unified molecular biology. (4) An evolutionary framework revealing how phase separation emerged and diversified across life, identifying ancient versus derived mechanisms and correlating LLPS evolution with cellular complexity. This addresses fundamental questions about the origins of cellular organization.\n\nMethodological Innovations: The project will establish new standards for multi-omics data integration in molecular biology. Our workflows for harmonizing heterogeneous datasets, extracting multi-scale features, and validating predictions across independent data sources will serve as templates for other synthesis efforts.

The success will encourage similar synthesis efforts in other areas of molecular biology, advancing the field toward more integrative, predictive science. Ultimately, this work will transform how we understand cellular organization and provide practical tools for addressing human disease.",

        "background_and_significance": "The origin of metabolism represents one of the most profound unsolved questions in biology, bridging chemistry, biology, and Earth sciences. Modern cellular metabolism comprises thousands of interconnected biochemical reactions catalyzed by highly specific enzymes, yet this complexity must have emerged from simpler prebiotic chemistry operating on the early Earth approximately 3.8-4.0 billion years ago. Understanding this transition is critical not only for reconstructing life's origins but also for comprehending fundamental principles governing biochemical organization, evolutionary innovation, and the chemical constraints that shape biological systems.\n\nCurrent research on metabolic origins remains fragmented across multiple disciplines. Geochemists have characterized the chemical composition of early Earth environments, identifying plausible prebiotic reaction conditions including hydrothermal vents, alkaline springs, and atmospheric chemistry. Prebiotic chemists have demonstrated that many metabolic intermediates can form abiotically under these conditions, with notable examples including the non-enzymatic synthesis of components of the reverse citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. However, these experimental studies typically focus on isolated reactions rather than integrated networks. Meanwhile, comparative genomics has revealed the distribution of metabolic genes across the tree of life, enabling inference of ancestral metabolic capabilities through phylogenetic reconstruction. Systems biology has developed sophisticated network analysis tools to understand metabolic organization, identifying modules, hubs, and hierarchical structures. Yet these approaches have rarely been integrated to address the fundamental question of how metabolism evolved.\n\nSeveral competing hypotheses attempt to explain metabolic origins. The metabolism-first hypothesis proposes that self-sustaining networks of chemical reactions preceded genetic information systems, with early metabolism driven by mineral catalysts or simple organic catalysts. The RNA world hypothesis suggests that ribozymes catalyzed early metabolism before protein enzymes evolved. The iron-sulfur world theory emphasizes the role of metal sulfide minerals in catalyzing primordial carbon fixation reactions. Each hypothesis makes distinct predictions about which metabolic pathways are most ancient, the chemical environments that supported early metabolism, and the sequence of pathway assembly. However, rigorous testing of these hypotheses requires synthesis of diverse data types that no single laboratory possesses the expertise or resources to integrate.\n\nRecent advances make this synthesis project timely and feasible. First, the explosion of genomic sequencing has provided metabolic gene data from over 200,000 organisms spanning all domains of life, including representatives from deep-branching lineages that retain signatures of ancient metabolism. Second, comprehensive metabolic databases (KEGG, MetaCyc, BRENDA, HMDB) now catalog thousands of characterized reactions, enzymes, and pathways with standardized annotations. Third, experimental studies have systematically characterized enzyme promiscuity—the ability of enzymes to catalyze alternative reactions—revealing how new metabolic functions can emerge. Fourth, computational advances in network analysis, phylogenetic reconstruction, and constraint-based modeling enable sophisticated analysis of metabolic evolution at unprecedented scales. Fifth, geochemical databases now provide detailed constraints on early Earth chemistry, including ocean composition, atmospheric gases, and hydrothermal fluid chemistry.\n\nDespite these resources, critical gaps remain. We lack systematic integration of phylogenetic distributions of metabolic pathways with geochemical constraints and prebiotic chemistry data. The relative antiquity of major metabolic modules remains contentious, with conflicting phylogenetic signals complicated by horizontal gene transfer, gene loss, and convergent evolution. The chemical feasibility of proposed ancestral pathways under realistic prebiotic conditions has not been systematically evaluated. Network-level principles governing metabolic expansion—whether through gradual elaboration or punctuated innovation—remain unclear. Most critically, no comprehensive framework exists for synthesizing geological, chemical, genomic, and systems-level data to reconstruct metabolic evolution.\n\nThis project addresses these gaps through unprecedented data synthesis and methodological innovation. By integrating multiple data types and analytical approaches, we will reconstruct plausible evolutionary trajectories of metabolic network assembly, test competing origin hypotheses, and identify fundamental principles of biochemical evolution. This work is significant because it will provide the first comprehensive, data-driven reconstruction of metabolic origins, establish new frameworks for evolutionary systems biology, and train a new generation of scientists capable of bridging chemistry, biology, and computational sciences. The insights gained will inform synthetic biology efforts to design minimal metabolic systems, astrobiology searches for biosignatures on other worlds, and fundamental understanding of how complex biological organization emerges from chemical principles.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes.\n\nResearch Question 1: Which metabolic pathways and reactions represent the ancient core of metabolism that was present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and potentially earlier protocells? We hypothesize that ancient core metabolism comprises a relatively small set of reactions (100-300) that are: (a) universally or nearly universally distributed across phylogenetically diverse organisms, (b) catalyzed by enzymes with deep phylogenetic roots and simple structural folds, (c) chemically feasible under plausible prebiotic conditions, and (d) organized into autocatalytic or self-amplifying network motifs. We predict that this ancient core will be enriched for reactions involving small molecules (C1-C6 compounds), simple cofactors (metal ions, thioesters), and central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, reverse citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA pathway). To test this hypothesis, we will integrate phylogenetic distribution data from genomic databases with enzyme age estimates from molecular clock analyses and structural biology data on protein fold antiquity. We will cross-validate candidates for ancient reactions by assessing their chemical feasibility using thermodynamic databases and published prebiotic chemistry experiments. Expected outcomes include a curated catalog of 100-300 high-confidence ancient reactions with supporting evidence scores, phylogenetic trees for ancient enzyme families, and network maps showing their interconnections.\n\nResearch Question 2: What were the dominant mechanisms of metabolic network expansion from the ancient core to modern complexity? We hypothesize that metabolic expansion occurred through distinct, identifiable mechanisms including: (a) gene duplication followed by functional divergence (neofunctionalization), (b) horizontal gene transfer enabling acquisition of novel pathways, (c) enzyme promiscuity providing substrate for selection of new functions, (d) pathway fusion creating new metabolic routes, and (e) recruitment of enzymes from non-metabolic functions. We predict that different metabolic subsystems expanded through different dominant mechanisms, with central metabolism showing more gene duplication and peripheral metabolism showing more horizontal transfer. We will test this by analyzing phylogenetic patterns of enzyme families, identifying duplication events and transfer events using reconciliation methods, and correlating expansion patterns with network topology metrics. We will quantify the relative contribution of each mechanism across different metabolic domains (amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, lipid metabolism, etc.) and across different lineages. Expected outcomes include quantitative estimates of mechanism contributions, identification of key innovation events in metabolic history, and network growth models parameterized by empirical data.\n\nResearch Question 3: Does metabolic evolution exhibit continuous gradual elaboration or punctuated episodes of rapid innovation? We hypothesize that metabolic evolution shows punctuated dynamics, with rapid expansion periods corresponding to: (a) major evolutionary transitions (origin of life, origin of photosynthesis, origin of eukaryotes), (b) environmental changes (Great Oxidation Event, Snowball Earth episodes), and (c) ecological innovations (colonization of new niches). We predict that network analysis will reveal distinct metabolic layers corresponding to different evolutionary epochs, with ancient core reactions showing high centrality and connectivity, and peripheral reactions showing signatures of recent innovation. To test this, we will perform temporal stratification of metabolic networks using molecular clock dating of enzyme families, correlate expansion events with geological and environmental data, and analyze network topology evolution over time. We will employ graph theory metrics (betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients, modularity) to characterize network structure at different evolutionary time points. Expected outcomes include a temporal atlas of metabolic network assembly, identification of major innovation episodes with geological correlates, and quantitative models of network growth dynamics.\n\nResearch Question 4: What chemical and physical constraints shaped the evolutionary trajectory of metabolism? We hypothesize that metabolic evolution was constrained by: (a) thermodynamic favorability of reactions under prevailing environmental conditions, (b) availability of chemical elements and cofactors, (c) catalytic mechanisms accessible to simple catalysts (minerals, small molecules, early peptides), and (d) network-level requirements for autocatalysis and robustness. We predict that ancient reactions will show greater thermodynamic favorability under early Earth conditions (anoxic, reduced, metal-rich environments) compared to modern conditions, and that pathway architectures will reflect optimization for robustness against environmental perturbations. To test this, we will integrate geochemical data on early Earth conditions with thermodynamic calculations for metabolic reactions, assess cofactor requirements against availability constraints, and perform computational simulations of proto-metabolic networks under varying environmental conditions. We will use constraint-based modeling (flux balance analysis) to evaluate which combinations of reactions could support cellular functions under different chemical scenarios. Expected outcomes include thermodynamic feasibility maps for ancient reactions, identification of critical chemical constraints that channeled metabolic evolution, and computational models of minimal viable proto-metabolic networks.\n\nAcross all research questions, we will validate findings through multiple independent lines of evidence, assess robustness to methodological choices and parameter values, and quantify uncertainty in inferences. All hypotheses generate specific, testable predictions that can be evaluated against synthesized data, and all analyses will be conducted with transparent, reproducible workflows following open science principles.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This synthesis project will integrate diverse data sources through a multi-phase analytical workflow, employing cutting-edge computational methods and fostering intensive collaboration among team members with complementary expertise.\n\nData Sources and Integration: We will compile and integrate five major data categories. (1) Metabolic pathway databases: KEGG (11,000+ organisms, 500+ pathways), MetaCyc (3,000+ pathways from 3,000+ organisms), BRENDA (enzyme kinetics and specificity), HMDB (human metabolites), and Reactome (pathway annotations). (2) Genomic and phylogenetic data: Complete genomes from NCBI RefSeq (200,000+ organisms), focusing on phylogenetically diverse representatives including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes with emphasis on deep-branching lineages. We will extract metabolic gene annotations using KEGG Orthology, COG, and Pfam databases. (3) Protein structural data: Protein Data Bank structures for metabolic enzymes, SCOP/CATH fold classifications, and AlphaFold predictions for ancient enzyme families to assess structural antiquity. (4) Geochemical data: Early Earth environmental parameters from published compilations including ocean chemistry, atmospheric composition, hydrothermal vent fluid chemistry, and mineral availability across geological time. (5) Prebiotic chemistry literature: Systematic literature mining (5,000+ papers) documenting abiotic synthesis of metabolic compounds and non-enzymatic catalysis of metabolic reactions. All data will be standardized using common identifiers (InChI for compounds, EC numbers for reactions, UniProt for proteins) and stored in a unified graph database enabling complex queries across data types.\n\nPhase 1 (Months 1-8): Ancient Core Metabolism Identification. We will employ phylogenetic profiling to identify metabolic reactions present across phylogenetically diverse organisms, calculating phylogenetic distribution scores for each reaction in KEGG/MetaCyc. For enzymes catalyzing candidate ancient reactions, we will reconstruct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood methods (IQ-TREE, RAxML) with rigorous model selection and bootstrap support assessment. We will perform molecular clock dating using RelTime and BEAST2 to estimate enzyme family ages, calibrating with established divergence times. Protein structural analysis will assess fold antiquity using established criteria (small size, high stability, simple topology). We will calculate thermodynamic feasibility for candidate ancient reactions using group contribution methods and published thermodynamic databases (eQuilibrator), evaluating ΔG values under plausible early Earth conditions (pH 5-9, temperature 25-100°C, varying redox potentials). Network analysis will identify autocatalytic motifs and self-amplifying cycles using graph algorithms. Integration of these multiple lines of evidence will produce a scored catalog of ancient reactions, with confidence levels based on agreement across methods.\n\nPhase 2 (Months 9-16): Metabolic Network Expansion Analysis. We will analyze mechanisms of metabolic expansion through phylogenomic approaches. Gene duplication events will be identified using gene tree-species tree reconciliation (NOTUNG, GeneRax), quantifying duplication rates across enzyme families and metabolic domains. Horizontal gene transfer events will be detected using phylogenetic incongruence methods and parametric approaches (ALE, AnGST), with validation through compositional analysis. Enzyme promiscuity data will be compiled from literature and BRENDA, analyzing relationships between primary and promiscuous activities to infer evolutionary trajectories. Pathway fusion events will be identified by detecting chimeric pathways sharing components with distinct phylogenetic histories. We will construct time-resolved metabolic networks by layering reactions according to estimated ages, analyzing network topology evolution using graph theory metrics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, modularity). Comparative analysis across lineages will identify lineage-specific innovations and universal expansion patterns. Statistical modeling will quantify relative contributions of different expansion mechanisms using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.\n\nPhase 3 (Months 17-24): Evolutionary Dynamics and Constraint Analysis. We will test punctuated versus gradual evolution models by analyzing temporal distributions of enzyme family origins using molecular clock data, employing change-point detection algorithms to identify rapid expansion episodes. Correlation analysis will relate expansion events to geological/environmental changes using time-series methods with appropriate corrections for temporal autocorrelation. We will assess chemical constraints by calculating thermodynamic favorability of reactions under time-varying environmental conditions, using geochemical models of ocean and atmosphere evolution. Cofactor requirement analysis will evaluate whether ancient reactions preferentially use cofactors available on early Earth (Fe, Ni, S, simple organics) versus modern cofactors (complex coenzymes). Constraint-based modeling using flux balance analysis will evaluate functional viability of reconstructed proto-metabolic networks, testing whether subsets of ancient reactions can support basic cellular functions (energy generation, biosynthesis of building blocks). We will perform sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of conclusions to parameter uncertainty and methodological choices.\n\nPhase 4 (Months 25-30): Integration, Validation, and Tool Development. We will integrate findings across phases to construct comprehensive evolutionary scenarios for metabolic origins and expansion. Alternative scenarios will be evaluated using Bayesian model comparison, assessing support for competing hypotheses (metabolism-first, RNA world, iron-sulfur world). Cross-validation will be performed using held-out data and independent test sets. We will develop open-source software tools including: (1) MetaboEvo database with curated ancient enzyme families and reactions, (2) network visualization tools for exploring evolutionary metabolic atlas, (3) analysis pipelines for phylogenetic profiling and network reconstruction, and (4) educational modules for training. All code will be version-controlled (GitHub), containerized (Docker), and documented with tutorials.\n\nTimeline and Milestones: Months 1-8: Data compilation complete, ancient core metabolism catalog (100-300 reactions) published as preprint. Months 9-16: Expansion mechanism analysis complete, network growth models published. Months 17-24: Evolutionary dynamics analysis complete, constraint analysis published. Months 25-30: Integration complete, evolutionary metabolic atlas released, final synthesis papers submitted, tools publicly available. The team will meet monthly via videoconference and hold two in-person workshops (months 10 and 24) for intensive collaboration. Quarterly progress reports will be shared with NCEMS and posted publicly.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes with broad impacts across multiple scientific disciplines and training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.\n\nPrimary Scientific Outcomes: The project will produce the first comprehensive, data-driven reconstruction of metabolic evolution from prebiotic chemistry to modern cellular metabolism. The Evolutionary Metabolic Atlas will provide an interactive, publicly accessible resource mapping the temporal assembly of metabolic networks, with reactions and pathways annotated by estimated age, phylogenetic distribution, chemical feasibility, and supporting evidence. This atlas will include approximately 100-300 high-confidence ancient reactions forming the metabolic core, temporal stratification of 3,000+ modern pathways, and quantitative models of network expansion dynamics. We will publish a curated database of ancient enzyme families (estimated 200-400 families) with phylogenetic trees, structural information, and functional annotations, serving as a reference for evolutionary biochemistry research. Quantitative estimates of expansion mechanism contributions will reveal how gene duplication, horizontal transfer, enzyme promiscuity, and other processes shaped metabolic evolution, with mechanism-specific rates calculated for different metabolic domains and lineages. Our analysis of evolutionary dynamics will definitively test whether metabolism evolved gradually or through punctuated innovation, identifying major expansion episodes and their geological/environmental correlates. Chemical constraint analysis will reveal fundamental principles governing biochemical evolution, including thermodynamic channeling effects, cofactor availability constraints, and network-level requirements for autocatalysis and robustness.\n\nMethodological Innovations: The project will establish new analytical frameworks for evolutionary systems biology, integrating phylogenomics, network analysis, thermodynamics, and geochemistry in unprecedented ways. We will develop and validate novel methods for temporal stratification of metabolic networks, combining molecular clock dating with network topology analysis. Our constraint-based modeling approaches for proto-metabolic networks will provide new tools for assessing functional viability of hypothetical ancestral metabolisms. The integration framework itself—spanning geological, chemical, genomic, and systems-level data—will serve as a model for future synthesis projects addressing other aspects of early evolution. All methods will be implemented in open-source software with comprehensive documentation, enabling other researchers to apply these approaches to related questions.\n\nBroader Scientific Impacts: This work will fundamentally advance understanding of life's origins, providing rigorous tests of competing hypotheses about metabolic origins and establishing empirical constraints on scenarios for the emergence of cellular life. The insights will inform synthetic biology efforts to design minimal metabolic systems, potentially enabling construction of artificial cells with simplified metabolism based on ancient core reactions. Astrobiology will benefit from identification of metabolic biosignatures most likely to be universal across life forms, guiding searches for life on other worlds. The chemical constraints identified will inform understanding of biochemical possibility space and the extent to which Earth's biochemistry is contingent versus inevitable. Evolutionary biology more broadly will gain insights into mechanisms of biochemical innovation applicable beyond metabolism. Systems biology will benefit from network-level principles of metabolic organization and evolution. The interdisciplinary approaches developed will serve as models for addressing other complex questions requiring synthesis across traditional disciplinary boundaries.\n\nTraining and Workforce Development: The project will train 6-8 graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research, providing expertise spanning computational biology, evolutionary biochemistry, geochemistry, and network science. Trainees will gain skills in large-scale data integration, phylogenetic analysis, network modeling, and collaborative team science. We will develop and disseminate educational modules including: (1) online tutorials for metabolic network analysis and evolutionary reconstruction, (2) workshop curricula for training in synthesis research methods, (3) case studies for teaching origins of life and evolutionary biochemistry, and (4) datasets and exercises for computational biology courses. These materials will be freely available and designed for diverse audiences from undergraduate to professional researchers. The project will particularly emphasize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with minority-serving institutions and professional societies promoting diversity in science.\n\nDissemination and Open Science: All findings will be disseminated through multiple channels following open science principles. We will publish 8-12 peer-reviewed papers in high-impact journals spanning molecular biology, evolution, systems biology, and origins of life research, with all papers made open access. Preprints will be posted immediately upon completion. The Evolutionary Metabolic Atlas will be released as a public web resource with interactive visualization tools, downloadable datasets, and API access. All analysis code will be deposited in GitHub repositories with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. Curated databases will be submitted to established repositories (e.g., Zenodo) with persistent identifiers. We will present findings at major conferences (ISMB, SMBE, Origins of Life Gordon Conference, Astrobiology Science Conference) and organize symposia bringing together diverse researchers. Public outreach will include popular science articles, blog posts, and social media engagement explaining the work's significance. We will engage with science journalists to ensure accurate reporting of findings.\n\nLong-term Vision and Sustainability: This project will establish a foundation for ongoing research on metabolic evolution and origins of life. The databases, tools, and analytical frameworks developed will continue to be valuable as new genomic data becomes available and geochemical understanding advances. We will seek additional funding to expand the work to other aspects of early cellular evolution (genetic systems, membrane biogenesis, regulatory networks) and to maintain and update resources. The collaborative network established will persist beyond the project period, fostering continued interdisciplinary research. The training programs will create a cohort of scientists equipped to pursue synthesis research throughout their careers, multiplying the project's long-term impact. Ultimately, this work will help establish evolutionary systems biology as a mature discipline with rigorous methods for reconstructing the deep history of cellular life.",

        "background_and_significance": "RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional structures that are critical for their biological functions. While the importance of RNA structure has been recognized since the discovery of tRNA and ribosomal RNA, the systematic exploration of structural elements across entire transcriptomes has only recently become feasible through high-throughput chemical probing technologies. Despite revolutionary advances in RNA structure probing methods over the past decade, including DMS-seq, SHAPE-seq, and icSHAPE, the vast majority of structural data generated remains underutilized in isolated repositories. The central challenge facing the field is not data scarcity but rather the lack of systematic integration and synthesis of existing datasets to extract biological insights about functional RNA structures.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that RNA secondary structures in untranslated regions (UTRs) regulate translation efficiency, mRNA stability, and subcellular localization. For instance, structured elements in 5' UTRs can modulate ribosome scanning and translation initiation, while 3' UTR structures influence mRNA decay rates and microRNA accessibility. The discovery of riboswitches in bacteria and their functional analogs in eukaryotes has highlighted how RNA structures can serve as molecular sensors responding to cellular conditions. Furthermore, RNA modifications such as m6A have been shown to alter local RNA structure, creating a dynamic regulatory landscape that responds to developmental and environmental cues. However, these discoveries have emerged from focused studies on individual transcripts or small gene sets, leaving the transcriptome-wide landscape of functional RNA structures largely uncharted.\n\nThe ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have generated extensive RNA structure probing data across multiple cell types and organisms, complemented by ribosome profiling data that reveals translation dynamics and eCLIP data mapping RNA-binding protein interactions. The GTEx project provides tissue-specific expression and genetic variation data across human populations. Specialized databases like RMBase catalog RNA modifications, while comparative genomics resources offer evolutionary conservation information across hundreds of species. Despite this wealth of publicly available data, no systematic effort has integrated these diverse data types to comprehensively identify and characterize functional RNA structural elements. Individual laboratories lack the multidisciplinary expertise and computational resources required to synthesize these heterogeneous datasets effectively.\n\nSeveral critical gaps limit our understanding of RNA structure-function relationships. First, we cannot reliably distinguish functional RNA structures under selective pressure from thermodynamically stable but biologically neutral structures. Second, the relationship between sequence conservation and structural conservation remains poorly understood—many functionally important structures may be maintained through compensatory mutations that preserve structure while altering sequence. Third, the impact of genetic variants on RNA structure and their contribution to disease phenotypes is largely unexplored, despite growing evidence that structure-disrupting mutations can cause pathology. Fourth, how RNA modifications dynamically remodel structural landscapes to regulate gene expression remains unclear. Finally, we lack comprehensive catalogs of structural motifs analogous to the transcription factor binding site databases that have proven invaluable for understanding transcriptional regulation.\n\nThis research is timely for several reasons. First, the accumulation of diverse RNA structure datasets has reached a critical mass enabling meaningful synthesis. Second, advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning approaches for sequence-structure relationships, provide powerful new analytical tools. Third, the recent success of RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines has intensified interest in understanding RNA structure for drug design. Fourth, the recognition that many disease-associated genetic variants occur in non-coding regions necessitates understanding structural regulatory mechanisms. Finally, the field is transitioning from studying individual RNA structures to systems-level approaches, creating demand for comprehensive resources and analytical frameworks. By synthesizing existing data through collaborative, multidisciplinary analysis, this project will address fundamental questions about the prevalence, conservation, and functional importance of RNA structures in gene regulation, providing a foundation for understanding post-transcriptional control mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic opportunities.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that require integration of diverse datasets and analytical approaches beyond the capacity of individual laboratories.\n\nResearch Question 1: What is the transcriptome-wide landscape of functionally constrained RNA structures, and how do they differ from thermodynamically stable but neutral structures? We hypothesize that functionally important RNA structures exhibit distinctive signatures combining evolutionary conservation at the structural level (maintained through compensatory mutations), consistent chemical probing patterns across cell types and conditions, and associations with regulatory outcomes such as altered translation efficiency or mRNA stability. We predict that approximately 15-25% of structured regions in UTRs and long non-coding RNAs are under functional constraint, based on preliminary analyses suggesting that most stable structures lack evolutionary conservation signatures. To test this hypothesis, we will develop a machine learning classifier integrating structural probing data, evolutionary conservation metrics calculated from multi-species alignments, ribosome profiling data indicating translational regulation, and RNA-binding protein interaction data. We will validate predictions by examining whether computationally identified functional structures are enriched for disease-associated variants and whether they show consistent structural patterns across independent datasets from different laboratories and experimental conditions.\n\nResearch Question 2: How do conserved structural motifs regulate specific molecular processes including translation initiation, mRNA localization, and decay? We hypothesize that distinct structural motif classes correspond to specific regulatory functions, analogous to how transcription factor binding motifs confer specific regulatory logic. We predict that translation-regulatory structures will be enriched in 5' UTRs and show strong correlations with ribosome profiling data, localization-regulatory structures will appear in 3' UTRs of transcripts with tissue-specific expression patterns, and stability-regulatory structures will correlate with mRNA half-life measurements. We will test these hypotheses by performing unsupervised clustering of structural motifs identified across the transcriptome, then systematically associating each motif class with functional genomics data including ribosome profiling (translation), RNA-seq from subcellular fractions (localization), and metabolic labeling experiments (stability). We will examine whether motifs show cell-type-specific functionality by integrating data from diverse cellular contexts available in ENCODE and GTEx. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive catalog of structural motif families with annotated regulatory functions, analogous to transcription factor motif databases but for post-transcriptional regulation.\n\nResearch Question 3: What is the impact of genetic variation on RNA structure, and how do structure-disrupting variants contribute to disease phenotypes? We hypothesize that variants disrupting functionally important RNA structures are under negative selection in human populations and are enriched among disease-associated variants, particularly for non-coding variants whose mechanisms remain unclear. We predict that structure-disrupting variants will show reduced allele frequencies in gnomAD population data compared to structure-neutral variants, and that rare structure-disrupting variants will be enriched in ClinVar pathogenic variants and GWAS-identified disease-associated loci. To test this, we will computationally predict structural impacts of all common and rare variants in UTRs and non-coding RNAs using both thermodynamic modeling and machine learning approaches trained on experimental structure data. We will calculate selection coefficients by comparing observed versus expected allele frequencies for structure-disrupting variants across different functional constraint categories. We will perform enrichment analyses examining whether structure-disrupting variants are overrepresented among disease-associated variants while controlling for local mutation rates and other confounding factors. Expected deliverables include genome-wide maps of structure-disrupting variants with predicted functional impacts and prioritized candidate variants for experimental validation by the broader research community.\n\nResearch Question 4: How do RNA modifications reshape structural landscapes to modulate gene regulation dynamically? We hypothesize that RNA modifications such as m6A, pseudouridine, and 2'-O-methylation alter local RNA structure in functionally important regions, creating condition-dependent regulatory switches. We predict that modification sites will be enriched in regions showing structural variability across conditions and that modifications will preferentially destabilize structures that otherwise would inhibit regulatory protein binding or ribosome access. To test this, we will integrate RNA modification maps from multiple technologies (m6A-seq, pseudouridine-seq, Nm-seq) with structure probing data from the same cell types and conditions. We will develop computational models predicting how specific modifications alter local structure based on training data where both modified and unmodified structures have been measured. We will examine whether modification-induced structural changes correlate with changes in translation efficiency, RNA-binding protein occupancy, or mRNA stability. Expected outcomes include predictive models for modification-structure relationships and identification of modification-dependent structural switches that regulate gene expression in response to cellular signals. These four research questions are interconnected and will be addressed through iterative analyses, with findings from each question informing and refining approaches to others, exemplifying the synthesis approach central to this project.",

RNA structure probing data will be obtained from ENCODE (>500 DMS-seq and SHAPE-seq datasets across human cell types), modENCODE (Drosophila and C. elegans structure data), Gene Expression Omnibus (>200 icSHAPE and Structure-seq datasets), and specialized databases including RNAStructuromeDB and ArchiveII. Ribosome profiling data will be compiled from GWIPS-viz (>300 datasets) and supplemented with datasets from published studies. RNA-binding protein interaction data will be obtained from ENCODE eCLIP experiments (>200 proteins) and POSTAR database. RNA modification data will be compiled from RMBase 3.0, covering m6A, pseudouridine, and other modifications across multiple cell types. Evolutionary conservation data will be derived from UCSC 100-way vertebrate alignments for human sequences and corresponding alignments for model organisms. Genetic variation data will be obtained from gnomAD (population variants), ClinVar (disease variants), and GWAS Catalog (trait-associated variants). GTEx data will provide tissue-specific expression and eQTL information. All datasets will be processed through standardized pipelines to ensure compatibility, with quality control metrics applied to exclude low-quality data. We will develop a unified data warehouse with consistent genomic coordinates, metadata annotations, and access interfaces.\n\nStructural Motif Discovery and Functional Classification (Months 4-12): We will apply multiple complementary approaches to identify structural motifs. First, we will use graph-based clustering algorithms to identify recurrent structural patterns in chemical probing data, representing RNA structures as graphs where nodes represent nucleotides and edges represent base-pairing interactions. Second, we will employ hidden Markov models to identify conserved structural elements across species, allowing for sequence variation while maintaining structural constraints. Third, we will develop deep learning models using convolutional neural networks to learn structural features directly from probing data without imposing predefined structural representations. Identified motifs will be functionally classified by integrating ribosome profiling data (translation regulation), subcellular RNA-seq (localization), mRNA half-life data (stability), and RNA-binding protein eCLIP data (protein interaction sites). We will perform enrichment analyses to associate motif classes with specific regulatory outcomes and develop a hierarchical classification system for structural regulatory elements.\n\nEvolutionary Analysis and Functional Constraint Identification (Months 6-15): To distinguish functional from neutral structures, we will develop metrics quantifying structural conservation independent of sequence conservation. We will implement covariation analysis identifying compensatory mutations that maintain base-pairing, calculate structural conservation scores based on alignment of predicted structures across species, and develop phylogenetic models testing for selection on structural features. We will integrate these evolutionary metrics with experimental structure data to train machine learning classifiers distinguishing functional from neutral structures. Classifier features will include structural conservation scores, consistency of structure across experimental replicates and conditions, association with regulatory outcomes, and enrichment for disease-associated variants. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and by testing predictions against held-out datasets and literature-curated functional structures.\n\nVariant Impact Prediction and Disease Association Analysis (Months 10-18): We will develop computational pipelines predicting structural impacts of genetic variants using both thermodynamic modeling (RNAsnp, remuRNA) and machine learning approaches trained on experimental data. For each variant, we will calculate structural disruption scores, predict changes in RNA-binding protein affinity, and estimate impacts on translation efficiency based on ribosome profiling patterns. We will perform population genetics analyses calculating selection coefficients for structure-disrupting variants across functional constraint categories. Disease association analyses will test for enrichment of structure-disrupting variants among ClinVar pathogenic variants and GWAS hits, using permutation-based statistical tests controlling for local mutation rates, recombination rates, and other genomic features. We will prioritize candidate disease variants for community follow-up based on predicted structural impacts and disease associations.\n\nRNA Modification-Structure Integration (Months 12-20): We will integrate RNA modification maps with structure probing data from matched cell types and conditions. For modification sites, we will compare local structural patterns in modification-enriched versus modification-depleted contexts, using statistical tests to identify significant structural differences. We will develop thermodynamic models incorporating modification-induced stability changes and train machine learning models predicting modification-dependent structural alterations. We will examine functional consequences by correlating modification-induced structural changes with changes in translation efficiency, RNA-binding protein occupancy, and mRNA stability across conditions where modification levels vary.\n\nResource Development and Dissemination (Months 15-24): We will develop a comprehensive RNA Structure Atlas as a public web resource providing searchable access to all identified structural motifs, functional annotations, evolutionary conservation data, and variant impact predictions. We will create validated structural motif libraries in standard formats compatible with existing RNA analysis tools. We will implement prediction tools as user-friendly web servers and command-line software for identifying regulatory structures in user-provided sequences. All analysis code will be deposited in GitHub repositories with comprehensive documentation. We will organize two training workshops teaching integrative RNA structure analysis methods to graduate students and postdocs from diverse institutions.\n\nTimeline and Milestones: Months 1-6: Data compilation and integration infrastructure; Month 6: First project meeting and trainee workshop; Months 7-12: Initial motif discovery and functional classification; Month 12: Interim results presentation at national meeting; Months 13-18: Evolutionary analyses and variant impact predictions; Month 18: Second project meeting and trainee workshop; Months 19-24: Resource development, manuscript preparation, and dissemination. The project team will meet monthly via videoconference with in-person meetings at months 6, 12, and 18.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This synthesis project will deliver transformative resources and insights advancing multiple areas of molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for collaborative data integration.\n\nPrimary Deliverables and Scientific Contributions: The RNA Structure Atlas will provide the first comprehensive, experimentally-informed map of functional RNA structures across human and model organism transcriptomes. This resource will include structural annotations for >50,000 transcripts, validated motif libraries containing 200-500 distinct structural regulatory elements with functional classifications, and genome-wide predictions of structure-disrupting variants with disease relevance. Unlike existing RNA structure databases that primarily catalog individual studies, our atlas will synthesize information across thousands of datasets, providing confidence scores based on consistency across experiments and evolutionary conservation. The atlas will enable researchers to query structural features of any transcript of interest, identify similar structural motifs across the transcriptome, and assess potential impacts of genetic variants on RNA structure and function. We will develop and disseminate computational tools including machine learning models for predicting functional RNA structures from sequence, algorithms for identifying structure-disrupting variants, and pipelines for integrating diverse RNA structure datasets. These tools will be made available as web servers with intuitive interfaces for experimental biologists and as open-source software packages for computational researchers. All analysis workflows will be documented and shared through protocols.io and GitHub, ensuring reproducibility and enabling community adaptation.\n\nFundamental Scientific Insights: This project will address longstanding questions about the prevalence and importance of RNA structure in gene regulation. By systematically distinguishing functional from neutral structures, we will provide the first reliable estimates of what fraction of the transcriptome is under structural constraint, resolving debates about the regulatory importance of RNA structure. Our evolutionary analyses will reveal principles governing structural conservation, including the relative contributions of sequence conservation versus compensatory mutations in maintaining functional structures. The comprehensive motif catalog will establish a classification system for structural regulatory elements analogous to transcription factor binding site classifications, enabling systematic study of post-transcriptional regulatory logic. Our variant impact analyses will illuminate how genetic variation affects RNA structure and contribute to understanding non-coding disease mechanisms, potentially explaining pathogenic mechanisms for variants currently classified as variants of uncertain significance. The integration of RNA modification data with structural information will reveal how dynamic structural remodeling regulates gene expression in response to cellular signals, establishing modification-structure relationships as a regulatory layer.\n\nBroader Impacts and Applications: The resources and insights generated will impact multiple research communities. For RNA biologists, the atlas will provide hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms for thousands of transcripts, accelerating discovery of novel regulatory elements. For human geneticists, variant impact predictions will aid interpretation of non-coding variants in clinical sequencing, potentially reclassifying variants of uncertain significance and identifying new disease genes. For drug developers, the catalog of functional structures will provide new therapeutic targets for RNA-targeted small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides, particularly relevant given recent successes of RNA-based therapeutics. For evolutionary biologists, our analyses of structural constraint will provide new perspectives on molecular evolution and the evolution of gene regulation. For computational biologists, our machine learning models and integration frameworks will establish methodological paradigms applicable to other synthesis challenges. The project will also impact education by training graduate students and postdocs in integrative, data-intensive approaches to biological questions, preparing the next generation of researchers for increasingly data-rich biology.\n\nDissemination and Publication Strategy: We will publish findings in high-impact journals including Nature, Science, Cell, and specialized journals such as Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Molecular Cell, and Genome Research. We anticipate 8-12 publications including comprehensive papers describing the overall atlas and approach, focused papers on specific findings (evolutionary principles, disease variants, modification-structure relationships), and methods papers describing computational tools. All publications will be open access or deposited in PubMed Central. We will present findings at major conferences including the RNA Society Meeting, ASHG, ISMB, and relevant Gordon Research Conferences. We will organize symposia at these meetings to disseminate methods and engage the community. The RNA Structure Atlas will be promoted through webinars, social media, and direct outreach to relevant research communities. We will establish an advisory board including representatives from clinical genetics, pharmaceutical industry, and diverse research communities to guide resource development and ensure broad utility.\n\nLong-term Vision and Sustainability: Beyond the initial project period, we envision the RNA Structure Atlas becoming a community resource analogous to ENCODE or GTEx, with ongoing updates as new data become available. We will pursue additional funding to support long-term maintenance and expansion, including integration of single-cell RNA structure data, structures from additional species, and experimental validation of predicted functional elements. We will establish partnerships with existing genomics resources to integrate structural annotations into widely-used genome browsers and databases. The collaborative network established through this project will continue through follow-up projects addressing questions emerging from initial findings, including experimental validation efforts and extension to other RNA regulatory mechanisms. The training workshops will be developed into sustainable educational programs offered regularly to the broader community. Ultimately, this project will establish RNA structure as a standard consideration in genomic analyses, transforming how researchers approach questions about gene regulation, genetic variation, and disease mechanisms.",

        "background_and_significance": "The concept of cellular identity has been central to biology since the recognition that multicellular organisms comprise distinct cell types with specialized functions. Traditionally, cell types were defined by morphology, location, and marker expression, but the advent of single-cell technologies has revealed unprecedented complexity in cellular states. Rather than discrete categories, cells occupy a continuous landscape of molecular configurations, challenging our fundamental understanding of what constitutes a cell type and how cells transition between states. This paradigm shift necessitates new conceptual and computational frameworks to map and understand cellular state space.\n\nRecent advances in single-cell genomics have generated massive datasets profiling individual cells across tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions. The Human Cell Atlas initiative alone aims to profile every cell type in the human body, while projects like ENCODE, the Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas, and numerous disease-specific atlases have produced petabytes of publicly available data. However, these datasets remain largely siloed, analyzed independently with inconsistent methodologies, and interpreted through the lens of traditional cell type classifications. The field lacks integrative frameworks that synthesize across datasets, modalities, and biological contexts to reveal universal principles of cellular state organization.\n\nWaddington's epigenetic landscape metaphor, proposed in 1957, envisioned development as cells rolling down valleys toward stable cell fates, but this remained a conceptual model without quantitative grounding. Recent theoretical work has begun formalizing cellular state spaces using concepts from dynamical systems theory, treating cell states as attractors in high-dimensional gene expression space. Studies by Trapnell and colleagues on trajectory inference, Regev's work on cell atlases, and theoretical frameworks from Huang and colleagues on cell fate decisions have laid important groundwork. However, current approaches face critical limitations: they typically analyze single datasets in isolation, focus on specific tissues or processes, use incompatible computational methods that prevent cross-study comparisons, and lack rigorous mathematical frameworks for defining state boundaries and transition probabilities.\n\nSeveral key gaps limit our understanding of cellular state space. First, we lack consensus on how to define cell type boundaries—are they sharp transitions or gradual continua? Second, the rules governing state transitions remain poorly understood—what molecular changes permit or prevent transitions between states? Third, we don't know whether universal principles govern state organization across different biological contexts, or whether each tissue and organism follows unique rules. Fourth, the relationship between different molecular layers (transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, proteome) in defining and constraining cellular states remains unclear. Finally, we lack predictive frameworks that can forecast how cells will respond to perturbations or navigate state space during reprogramming, differentiation, or disease transformation.\n\nThis research is critically important and timely for several reasons. First, understanding cellular state transitions is fundamental to regenerative medicine, as reprogramming and directed differentiation require navigating cells through state space toward desired fates. Second, cancer can be viewed as aberrant navigation of cellular state space, and mapping these trajectories could reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities. Third, the explosion of single-cell data provides an unprecedented opportunity for synthesis that wasn't possible even five years ago. Fourth, recent advances in topological data analysis, optimal transport theory, and deep learning provide new mathematical tools for analyzing high-dimensional state spaces. Finally, the field is at an inflection point where synthesis across datasets could yield transformative insights that individual studies cannot achieve.\n\nThe significance of this work extends beyond basic science. Clinically, understanding state transitions could improve cell therapy manufacturing, identify disease biomarkers based on aberrant state trajectories, and reveal new therapeutic strategies that push diseased cells toward healthy states. Technologically, this project will develop computational infrastructure and analytical frameworks that will benefit the entire single-cell community. Educationally, training researchers to integrate diverse data types and apply quantitative frameworks to biological questions addresses a critical workforce need. This synthesis project requires collaboration across disciplines—developmental biologists to interpret cellular states, computational biologists to process massive datasets, physicists and mathematicians to develop theoretical frameworks, and machine learning experts to build predictive models—making it ideally suited for community-scale synthesis support.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project addresses five interconnected research questions that will fundamentally advance our understanding of cellular state organization and dynamics.\n\nResearch Question 1: What is the global architecture of cellular state space, and how is it organized across tissues, developmental stages, and species? We hypothesize that cellular state space exhibits hierarchical organization with major basins corresponding to germ layers and tissue lineages, within which finer-scale attractors represent individual cell types. We predict that this organization will be conserved across species at higher hierarchical levels but diverge at finer scales. To test this, we will integrate single-cell transcriptomic data from human, mouse, zebrafish, and Drosophila developmental atlases, applying manifold learning and topological data analysis to identify the dimensionality and structure of state space. We will quantify the number and stability of attractor states, measure distances between cell types in state space, and determine whether these distances correlate with lineage relationships and differentiation trajectories. Expected outcomes include a quantitative map of cellular state space architecture and metrics for measuring state similarity across species.\n\nResearch Question 2: What molecular features define boundaries between cell types, and are these boundaries sharp or gradual? We hypothesize that cell type boundaries correspond to ridges in the Waddington landscape where regulatory networks create barriers to state transitions, and that boundary sharpness varies depending on the developmental or functional relationship between cell types. We predict that transcription factor networks and chromatin accessibility patterns will show coordinated changes at boundaries, with sharp boundaries characterized by bistable regulatory circuits and gradual boundaries by continuous regulatory gradients. To test this, we will integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to identify regions of state space with rapid versus gradual molecular changes. We will apply potential landscape reconstruction methods to estimate barrier heights between states and use information theory to quantify the distinctness of cell type clusters. We will validate predictions by analyzing reprogramming datasets where cells cross boundaries, testing whether predicted barrier heights correlate with reprogramming efficiency. Expected outcomes include a classification of boundary types and molecular signatures that predict boundary properties.\n\nResearch Question 3: What are the universal principles governing cell state transitions, and how do regulatory networks constrain possible trajectories? We hypothesize that state transitions follow minimum-action paths through state space, constrained by the regulatory network topology, and that certain hub transcription factors act as gatekeepers controlling access to different regions of state space. We predict that natural developmental trajectories will follow paths of least resistance (lowest barrier heights) and that forced reprogramming trajectories that deviate from these paths will be less efficient. To test this, we will analyze lineage tracing data integrated with single-cell profiles to map actual trajectories cells take during development. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks from multi-modal data and use dynamical systems modeling to predict allowed versus forbidden transitions. We will compare predicted optimal paths with observed trajectories in development, reprogramming, and transdifferentiation datasets. Expected outcomes include a catalog of transition rules, identification of gatekeeper factors, and predictive models for trajectory optimization.\n\nResearch Question 4: How do cells navigate state space during reprogramming, and what determines success versus failure? We hypothesize that successful reprogramming requires cells to overcome specific regulatory barriers in a defined sequence, and that failed reprogramming results from cells becoming trapped in intermediate attractor states. We predict that reprogramming trajectories will show stereotyped intermediate states and that the probability of reaching the target state depends on successfully traversing these waypoints. To test this, we will synthesize data from iPSC reprogramming, direct reprogramming, and transdifferentiation experiments across multiple protocols and cell types. We will identify common intermediate states, quantify transition probabilities between states, and determine which molecular changes predict successful versus failed reprogramming. We will build probabilistic models of reprogramming trajectories and validate predictions against held-out datasets. Expected outcomes include a roadmap of reprogramming routes and molecular signatures predicting reprogramming outcomes.\n\nResearch Question 5: How is cellular state space altered in disease, particularly cancer, and can we identify therapeutic strategies based on state space navigation? We hypothesize that disease involves aberrant attractor states or altered transition probabilities, and that therapeutic interventions can be understood as pushing cells toward healthy regions of state space. We predict that cancer cells occupy distinct regions of state space characterized by partial dedifferentiation and that metastatic potential correlates with increased state plasticity. To test this, we will integrate single-cell data from healthy tissues, primary tumors, metastases, and cancer cell lines across multiple cancer types. We will map disease states relative to normal developmental trajectories, quantify state space alterations, and identify molecular perturbations that could redirect diseased cells toward healthy states. Expected outcomes include disease state maps, identification of therapeutic targets based on state space analysis, and a framework for rational design of combination therapies that sequentially push cells through state space.\n\nAcross all questions, we will validate computational predictions through multiple approaches: comparison with experimental perturbation data, cross-validation across independent datasets, and consistency checks across different analytical methods. Success will be measured by the ability to predict cell behavior in held-out datasets and the generation of testable hypotheses for future experimental validation.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our methodological approach integrates data synthesis, computational analysis, theoretical modeling, and tool development across a 36-month timeline organized into four overlapping phases.\n\nData Sources and Integration (Months 1-12): We will systematically identify and curate publicly available datasets from multiple repositories.

We will establish data quality criteria including minimum cell numbers, sequencing depth thresholds, and metadata completeness. A dedicated data curation team will standardize metadata using ontologies (Cell Ontology, Uberon, Disease Ontology) and process raw data through uniform pipelines. For scRNA-seq, we will use Seurat and Scanpy pipelines with consistent quality control, normalization, and batch correction (Harmony, scVI). For scATAC-seq, we will use ArchR and SnapATAC2 with peak calling and motif enrichment. Multi-modal integration will employ MOFA+, Seurat v4 WNN, and MultiVI. We anticipate integrating 200+ datasets representing >100 million cells.\n\nComputational Infrastructure and Analysis Pipeline (Months 1-36): We will establish cloud-based computational infrastructure using AWS or Google Cloud with distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Dask) to handle petabyte-scale data. Our analysis pipeline comprises five integrated modules: (1) Dimensionality reduction and manifold learning using UMAP, diffusion maps, and variational autoencoders to embed cells in low-dimensional state space while preserving global structure. (2) Attractor state identification using density-based clustering (HDBSCAN), Gaussian mixture models, and persistent homology to identify stable cell states and quantify their basin sizes. (3) Trajectory inference using RNA velocity, Waddington-OT optimal transport, and CellRank to reconstruct transition paths and estimate transition probabilities. (4) Regulatory network reconstruction using SCENIC+, CellOracle, and GRNBoost to infer gene regulatory networks from multi-modal data. (5) Landscape reconstruction using potential energy surface estimation methods adapted from statistical physics, implementing algorithms from Bhattacharya et al. and Wang et al. to quantify barrier heights and transition rates.\n\nMathematical and Theoretical Framework Development (Months 6-30): We will develop rigorous mathematical frameworks for cellular state space analysis. First, we will apply topological data analysis using persistent homology to characterize the shape of state space, identifying holes, voids, and connected components that represent biological structures. We will use the Mapper algorithm to create topological networks of cellular states. Second, we will implement landscape theory from statistical physics, treating cells as particles in a potential energy landscape where gene expression dynamics follow stochastic differential equations. We will estimate potential functions using maximum entropy methods and calculate transition rates using Kramers theory. Third, we will develop information-theoretic measures of cell type distinctness using mutual information, transfer entropy, and channel capacity to quantify boundary sharpness. Fourth, we will apply optimal transport theory to measure distances between cell state distributions and infer minimum-cost paths through state space. Fifth, we will build probabilistic graphical models representing state transition networks with edge weights reflecting transition probabilities.\n\nMachine Learning and Predictive Modeling (Months 12-36): We will develop deep learning models for state prediction and trajectory forecasting. We will train variational autoencoders to learn compressed representations of cellular states that capture biological variation while removing technical noise. We will implement graph neural networks that operate on cell-cell similarity graphs to predict state transitions. We will develop temporal models using recurrent neural networks and neural ODEs to forecast trajectory dynamics. All models will be trained on 80% of data with 20% held out for validation, using cross-validation across datasets to ensure generalizability. We will implement interpretability methods (attention mechanisms, SHAP values) to identify molecular features driving predictions.\n\nValidation and Benchmarking (Months 18-36): We will validate predictions through multiple approaches: (1) Cross-dataset validation testing whether models trained on one dataset generalize to independent datasets, (2) Perturbation prediction testing whether models correctly predict outcomes of genetic or chemical perturbations in held-out datasets, (3) Reprogramming prediction testing whether predicted optimal paths match efficient reprogramming protocols, (4) Benchmark comparisons evaluating our methods against existing trajectory inference and cell type classification tools using standardized metrics.\n\nTool Development and Dissemination (Months 12-36): We will develop open-source software packages in Python and R implementing our methods, with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. We will create an interactive web portal for exploring the cellular state atlas with visualization tools for navigating state space, querying cell types, and predicting trajectories. All code will be version-controlled on GitHub with continuous integration testing.\n\nTimeline and Milestones: Months 1-6: Data curation and infrastructure setup; Months 6-12: Initial integration and attractor identification; Months 12-18: Boundary analysis and regulatory network reconstruction; Months 18-24: Trajectory analysis and landscape reconstruction; Months 24-30: Disease state mapping and therapeutic prediction; Months 30-36: Tool finalization, validation, and dissemination. Quarterly meetings will assess progress against milestones with adaptive planning to address challenges.\n\nTeam Composition and Collaboration: Our team spans developmental biology (3 labs), computational biology (4 labs), physics/applied mathematics (2 labs), and machine learning (2 labs) across 8 institutions and 4 countries, representing diverse career stages from graduate students to senior investigators. Monthly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops, and collaborative coding sprints will facilitate integration.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will deliver transformative outcomes across multiple dimensions, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications in cellular biology.\n\nScientific Outcomes and Contributions: The primary scientific deliverable is a comprehensive Cellular State Atlas—an interactive, quantitative map of cellular state space integrating data from millions of cells across species, tissues, and conditions. This atlas will provide the first unified framework for understanding cell identity, revealing the global architecture of cellular states and the rules governing transitions between them. We expect to identify 500-1000 distinct attractor states across integrated datasets, characterize their stability and basin geometries, and map the network of possible transitions. This will fundamentally advance our understanding of what defines a cell type, moving beyond descriptive marker-based classifications to quantitative, dynamics-based definitions grounded in state space geometry and regulatory network structure.\n\nWe will establish universal principles of cell state organization, determining whether common architectural features exist across biological contexts or whether each system follows unique rules. We anticipate discovering conserved organizational principles at higher hierarchical levels (germ layer organization, epithelial-mesenchymal axes) while identifying context-specific features at finer scales. This will resolve long-standing debates about the discrete versus continuous nature of cell types by showing that both views are partially correct—cell types represent local attractors in a continuous state space, with boundary sharpness varying depending on regulatory network topology.\n\nOur analysis of state transitions will reveal molecular rules governing cellular plasticity, identifying gatekeeper transcription factors, chromatin remodeling requirements, and metabolic constraints that permit or prevent specific transitions. We will generate a catalog of transition paths with associated barrier heights and transition rates, enabling prediction of which reprogramming strategies will succeed. This addresses fundamental questions in developmental biology about lineage restriction and cell fate commitment while providing practical guidance for regenerative medicine applications.\n\nThe disease state mapping component will reveal how pathological conditions alter cellular state space, identifying aberrant attractors in cancer, fibrosis, and other diseases. We expect to show that cancer cells occupy regions of state space corresponding to developmental intermediates or hybrid states, explaining their plasticity and therapeutic resistance. This will suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on state space navigation—using combinations of perturbations to push diseased cells toward healthy attractors or trap them in therapeutically vulnerable states.\n\nComputational and Methodological Impact: We will deliver a suite of open-source computational tools that will become community standards for single-cell analysis. These include: (1) StateSpace—a Python package for state space mapping and landscape reconstruction, (2) TransitionNet—tools for trajectory inference and transition probability estimation, (3) MultiModalIntegrator—standardized workflows for integrating scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and proteomics data, (4) CellPredictor—machine learning models for predicting cell state transitions and perturbation responses. All tools will be documented, benchmarked, and distributed through standard repositories (PyPI, Bioconductor) with Docker containers ensuring reproducibility.\n\nThe mathematical frameworks we develop will bridge biology and physics, demonstrating how concepts from statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory can be rigorously applied to cellular systems. This will open new avenues for theoretical biology and inspire applications to other complex biological systems.\n\nBroader Impacts and Applications: The clinical implications are substantial. Our reprogramming roadmaps will accelerate development of cell therapies by identifying optimal protocols for generating desired cell types. Disease state maps will reveal biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic monitoring. State-space-based therapeutic strategies could enable rational design of combination therapies that sequentially push cells through state space toward desired outcomes.\n\nEducational and training impacts will be significant. We will train 15-20 graduate students and postdocs in quantitative approaches to cell biology, preparing them for careers at the biology-computation interface. We will develop and disseminate educational materials including online tutorials, workshop curricula, and a textbook chapter on cellular state space concepts. Annual workshops will train 50-100 external researchers in our methods and tools.\n\nDissemination and Publication Strategy: We will publish findings in high-impact journals (Nature, Science, Cell) for major discoveries and specialized journals (Nature Methods, Genome Biology, Cell Systems) for methodological advances. We commit to preprint posting and open access publication. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be publicly available through GitHub, Zenodo, and the Cellular State Atlas portal. We will present findings at major conferences (ASCB, ISSCR, ISMB) and organize symposia bringing together experimental and computational researchers.\n\nLong-term Vision and Sustainability: This project establishes infrastructure and community connections that will persist beyond the funding period. The Cellular State Atlas will be maintained as a community resource with mechanisms for incorporating new datasets. The computational tools will be sustained through community adoption and continued development. We will pursue follow-up funding to extend the framework to additional biological contexts, incorporate spatial information, and develop real-time state prediction for guiding experimental decisions. We envision this project catalyzing a paradigm shift toward quantitative, dynamics-based understanding of cellular identity that will shape molecular and cellular biology for decades to come.",

        "background_and_significance": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form the foundation of virtually all cellular processes, from signal transduction and metabolic regulation to gene expression and cell division. Over the past two decades, systematic efforts have catalogued tens of thousands of interactions across model organisms, creating comprehensive interaction networks that have transformed our understanding of cellular organization. However, these networks suffer from a critical blind spot: they predominantly capture stable, high-affinity interactions while systematically missing the transient and weak interactions that constitute the majority of regulatory events in living cells. This 'interaction dark matter' represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of cellular regulation and decision-making.\n\nCurrent protein interaction databases, including BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct, contain over 2 million documented interactions across species. Yet multiple lines of evidence suggest these represent only a fraction of functionally relevant interactions. Biophysical studies indicate that most regulatory interactions occur with dissociation constants in the micromolar to millimolar range and lifetimes of milliseconds to seconds, making them difficult to capture with conventional methods. Affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), the workhorse of interactome mapping, preferentially identifies stable complexes due to washing steps that disrupt weak interactions. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, while capable of detecting transient interactions, suffer from high false-positive rates and miss interactions requiring post-translational modifications or specific cellular contexts. The result is a systematic bias toward stable 'housekeeping' complexes at the expense of dynamic regulatory interactions.\n\nRecent technological advances have begun to illuminate this dark matter. Proximity labeling methods like BioID and APEX capture proteins in close spatial proximity regardless of interaction strength, revealing context-dependent interaction neighborhoods. Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) provides snapshots of transient interactions by covalently linking proteins before purification. Advances in structural biology, particularly AlphaFold-Multimer, now enable prediction of interaction interfaces at proteome scale, offering complementary evidence for potential interactions. Phosphoproteomics datasets reveal how post-translational modifications regulate interaction dynamics. Cellular localization studies show how spatial organization constrains interaction possibilities. However, these diverse datasets remain largely siloed, analyzed independently without systematic integration.\n\nThe significance of transient interactions extends far beyond filling gaps in interaction maps. Weak interactions enable ultrasensitive switches, allow rapid signal propagation, facilitate competitive binding dynamics, and create regulatory flexibility impossible with stable complexes alone. In signaling cascades, transient interactions between kinases and substrates enable rapid response and reversibility. In transcriptional regulation, weak interactions between transcription factors and co-regulators allow combinatorial control and context-dependent gene expression. In metabolic regulation, transient enzyme-enzyme interactions enable substrate channeling and allosteric regulation. Understanding these interactions is essential for comprehending how cells process information, make decisions, and respond to environmental changes.\n\nSeveral fundamental questions remain unanswered. What distinguishes functional transient interactions from non-specific binding events that occur due to high cellular protein concentrations? How do cells regulate interaction dynamics through post-translational modifications, localization changes, and conformational switches? What network motifs and architectural principles govern transient interaction networks? How do transient interactions contribute to cellular phenotypes and disease states? Addressing these questions requires integrating orthogonal experimental approaches, each capturing different aspects of the interaction landscape, with computational methods that can distinguish signal from noise at unprecedented scale.\n\nThis synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exists across multiple public repositories, representing billions of dollars of experimental investment. Second, structural prediction tools have matured to enable proteome-scale modeling. Third, machine learning approaches can now integrate heterogeneous data types to extract biological insights. Fourth, the field increasingly recognizes that understanding cellular regulation requires moving beyond static interaction networks to dynamic, context-dependent models. Finally, this synthesis requires expertise spanning structural biology, proteomics, biophysics, network science, and machine learning—a truly transdisciplinary effort beyond the scope of individual laboratories. By illuminating protein interaction dark matter, this project will fundamentally advance our understanding of cellular regulation and provide new frameworks for interpreting functional genomics data, understanding disease mechanisms, and designing therapeutic interventions.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to illuminate the hidden layer of transient and weak protein interactions governing cellular regulation.\n\nResearch Question 1: What is the scope and functional significance of transient protein interactions across cellular contexts? We hypothesize that transient interactions outnumber stable interactions by at least 3:1 in the functional interactome, with enrichment in regulatory processes (signaling, transcription, cell cycle control) compared to housekeeping functions (translation, metabolism, protein folding). We predict that integrating proximity labeling data with AP-MS and Y2H datasets will reveal 50,000-100,000 previously uncharacterized context-dependent interactions in human cells alone. To test this hypothesis, we will systematically compare interaction detection across methods, identifying interactions captured by proximity labeling or XL-MS but absent from AP-MS databases. We will assess functional enrichment using Gene Ontology and pathway databases, expecting transient interactions to show significant enrichment in signal transduction (p<0.001) and transcriptional regulation (p<0.001) compared to stable complexes. We will validate predictions by examining known regulatory systems where transient interactions are well-characterized (e.g., MAPK cascades, NF-κB signaling) and quantifying the ratio of transient to stable interactions. Expected outcomes include a quantitative census of transient interactions across cellular processes and identification of biological contexts where transient interactions predominate.\n\nResearch Question 2: Can we distinguish functional transient interactions from non-specific binding using integrated multi-modal data? We hypothesize that functional transient interactions exhibit distinct signatures across multiple data dimensions: structural complementarity at interaction interfaces, evolutionary conservation of interface residues, co-expression and co-localization patterns, and functional relationships in genetic interaction networks. We predict that machine learning models integrating these features will achieve >80% accuracy in distinguishing functional transient interactions from non-specific binding, substantially outperforming single-data-type approaches. To test this, we will develop supervised learning models trained on gold-standard positive examples (literature-curated transient interactions with functional validation) and negative examples (computationally predicted non-specific interactions). Features will include AlphaFold-Multimer confidence scores, interface residue conservation from multiple sequence alignments, co-expression correlation from transcriptomics databases, co-localization evidence from imaging studies, and genetic interaction profiles from CRISPR and RNAi screens. We will employ ensemble methods combining gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks, with rigorous cross-validation and holdout testing. Model performance will be evaluated using precision-recall curves, with particular attention to high-precision regimes suitable for generating testable predictions. Expected deliverables include validated predictive models, feature importance rankings revealing which data types most effectively distinguish functional interactions, and confidence scores for all predicted transient interactions.\n\nResearch Question 3: How do post-translational modifications and cellular context modulate interaction dynamics? We hypothesize that post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, act as dynamic switches that regulate interaction strength and specificity, with >30% of transient interactions showing context-dependent regulation. We predict that integrating phosphoproteomics data with interaction networks will reveal specific PTM sites that modulate interaction interfaces, creating condition-specific interaction networks. To test this hypothesis, we will map PTM sites from PhosphoSitePlus, iPTMnet, and published phosphoproteomics studies onto protein structures and interaction interfaces predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. We will identify PTM sites within 8Å of predicted interaction interfaces, hypothesizing these directly modulate binding. We will integrate time-resolved phosphoproteomics data from stimulus-response experiments to identify PTMs that change coincident with interaction dynamics. For cellular context, we will integrate subcellular localization data from the Human Protein Atlas and dynamic localization studies to identify interactions requiring specific compartmentalization. We will construct context-specific networks for different cell types, cell cycle stages, and signaling states. Expected outcomes include a PTM-annotated interaction atlas, identification of regulatory PTM sites controlling interaction dynamics, and context-specific interaction networks revealing how interaction landscapes change across cellular conditions.\n\nResearch Question 4: What network principles govern transient interaction networks and their contribution to cellular information processing? We hypothesize that transient interaction networks exhibit distinct topological properties compared to stable complex networks, including higher clustering coefficients, shorter path lengths, and enrichment of specific network motifs (feed-forward loops, bifans) that enable ultrasensitive responses and signal integration. We predict that transient interactions create 'regulatory layers' that modulate stable complex functions, with hub proteins in transient networks showing enrichment for regulatory roles and disease associations. To test this, we will perform comprehensive network analysis comparing topological properties of transient versus stable interaction networks. We will identify network motifs using established algorithms and assess their functional significance through enrichment analysis. We will examine how transient interactions connect stable complexes, creating higher-order functional modules. We will integrate genetic interaction data to assess whether transient interaction partners show enhanced genetic interactions, indicating functional interdependence. We will analyze disease-associated mutations from ClinVar and COSMIC, hypothesizing enrichment at transient interaction interfaces. Expected deliverables include quantitative characterization of transient network topology, identification of regulatory network motifs, and mechanistic models of how transient interactions enable cellular information processing and decision-making. These insights will provide new frameworks for understanding cellular regulation and interpreting functional genomics data.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our synthesis approach integrates diverse publicly available datasets through a multi-phase analytical pipeline, combining data harmonization, machine learning, structural modeling, and network analysis. The project spans 36 months with clearly defined milestones and deliverables.\n\nPhase 1: Data Collection and Harmonization (Months 1-6).

From BioGRID (>2M interactions), STRING (>3B interactions across species), IntAct (>1M curated interactions), and MINT, we will extract stable interaction data with associated confidence scores and experimental evidence codes. We will compile proximity labeling data from published BioID, APEX, and TurboID studies, accessing raw data from PRIDE and MassIVE proteomics repositories. Crosslinking mass spectrometry data will be collected from published XL-MS studies and the PRIDE-XL database. For each interaction, we will extract experimental method, organism, cell type, and conditions. We will download AlphaFold-Multimer predictions for all human, mouse, yeast, and E. coli protein pairs from the AlphaFold database, focusing on predictions with interface pTM scores >0.5. Phosphoproteomics data will be compiled from PhosphoSitePlus (>500K PTM sites), iPTMnet, and published time-resolved phosphoproteomics studies from PRIDE. Subcellular localization data will be obtained from the Human Protein Atlas, Cell-PLoc, and published imaging studies. Functional genomics data including gene expression (GTEx, Expression Atlas), genetic interactions (BioGRID, CORUM), and phenotype associations (MGI, SGD) will be integrated. All data will be harmonized to common protein identifiers using UniProt mappings, with careful tracking of orthology relationships across species. We will implement quality control filters, removing low-confidence interactions and ensuring reproducibility. Data will be stored in a graph database (Neo4j) enabling efficient querying of multi-modal relationships. Deliverable: Integrated multi-modal interaction database with >5M interactions and associated metadata.\n\nPhase 2: Transient Interaction Identification and Classification (Months 7-15). We will develop computational methods to identify and classify transient interactions. First, we will categorize interactions by detection method, classifying those detected exclusively by proximity labeling or XL-MS (but not AP-MS) as candidate transient interactions. We will calculate method-specific detection frequencies, identifying interactions with high proximity labeling evidence but low AP-MS evidence as high-confidence transient candidates. Second, we will develop machine learning models to predict interaction stability. Training data will comprise literature-curated examples of stable complexes (from CORUM, PDB) and validated transient interactions (from literature mining of kinase-substrate, transcription factor-coregulator, and signaling protein interactions). Features will include: (1) AlphaFold-Multimer confidence scores and interface areas; (2) interface residue conservation calculated from multiple sequence alignments; (3) biophysical properties including interface hydrophobicity, charge complementarity, and predicted binding affinity from structural models; (4) co-expression correlation across tissues and conditions; (5) co-localization evidence; (6) genetic interaction profiles; (7) functional similarity scores. We will train gradient boosting models (XGBoost), random forests, and deep neural networks, using 5-fold cross-validation and holdout test sets. Model ensembles will generate probability scores for interaction stability. We will apply models to all interactions in our database, generating stability classifications and confidence scores. Third, we will perform systematic comparison of interaction detection across methods, calculating overlap statistics and identifying method-specific biases. Deliverable: Classified interaction database with stability predictions and confidence scores for >3M interactions.\n\nPhase 3: PTM-Mediated Regulation and Context-Dependent Networks (Months 16-24). We will map post-translational modifications onto interaction interfaces to identify regulatory mechanisms. Using AlphaFold structures, we will identify PTM sites within 8Å of predicted interaction interfaces, hypothesizing these directly modulate binding. We will calculate enrichment of PTMs at interfaces versus non-interface regions, expecting significant enrichment (p<0.001) for regulatory PTMs. We will integrate time-resolved phosphoproteomics data from stimulus-response experiments (growth factor signaling, stress responses, cell cycle progression), identifying PTMs that change coincident with predicted interaction dynamics. We will construct temporal networks showing how interaction landscapes evolve following stimuli. For context-dependent analysis, we will build cell-type-specific networks by integrating cell-type-specific expression and localization data, identifying interactions possible only in specific cellular contexts. We will construct condition-specific networks for different cell cycle stages, differentiation states, and disease conditions using published transcriptomics and proteomics data. Network comparison will identify context-specific interactions and core interactions present across conditions. Deliverable: PTM-annotated interaction atlas and context-specific interaction networks for 10+ cellular conditions.\n\nPhase 4: Network Analysis and Functional Characterization (Months 25-33). We will perform comprehensive network analysis to understand organizational principles. Topological analysis will calculate degree distributions, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and centrality measures, comparing transient versus stable networks. Motif analysis using FANMOD and custom algorithms will identify overrepresented network patterns. We will assess functional enrichment of network modules using Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, and Reactome. We will integrate genetic interaction data to identify functional relationships between transient interaction partners. Disease association analysis will map mutations from ClinVar and COSMIC onto interaction interfaces, calculating enrichment of disease mutations at transient versus stable interfaces. We will develop mechanistic models of specific regulatory systems (MAPK signaling, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation) incorporating transient interactions. Deliverable: Comprehensive network analysis results and mechanistic models.\n\nPhase 5: Resource Development and Dissemination (Months 34-36). We will develop public-facing resources including an interactive web portal for querying the dynamic interaction atlas, downloadable datasets with standardized formats, analysis pipelines as documented workflows, and training materials. All code will be deposited on GitHub with comprehensive documentation.

        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This synthesis project will deliver transformative resources, methodologies, and insights that fundamentally advance molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for understanding cellular regulation.\n\nPrimary Deliverables and Resources. The Dynamic Interaction Atlas will constitute the project's flagship resource—a comprehensive, publicly accessible database integrating >5 million protein interactions with stability classifications, confidence scores, context annotations, and PTM regulatory information. Unlike existing databases that treat all interactions equivalently, our atlas will distinguish stable complexes from transient regulatory interactions, providing researchers with unprecedented insight into interaction dynamics. Each interaction will be annotated with supporting evidence from multiple experimental modalities, structural predictions, and functional context. The atlas will feature an interactive web interface enabling researchers to query interactions by protein, pathway, cellular context, or regulatory mechanism, visualize context-specific networks, and download customized datasets. This resource will be continuously maintained and updated as new data becomes available, ensuring long-term utility. We will develop and publicly release validated machine learning models for predicting transient interactions and assessing interaction stability. These models, trained on integrated multi-modal data, will enable researchers to generate predictions for novel protein pairs, prioritize interactions for experimental validation, and interpret their own interaction data. Models will be packaged as user-friendly software tools with comprehensive documentation and example workflows. We will create standardized data integration pipelines implemented as reproducible workflows using Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Nextflow, enabling other researchers to apply our approaches to new datasets or different organisms. All analysis code will be deposited in public GitHub repositories with detailed documentation, example datasets, and tutorials.\n\nScientific Advances and Insights. This project will address fundamental questions about cellular organization and regulation. By systematically characterizing transient interactions across cellular contexts, we will reveal the hidden regulatory layer that governs cellular decision-making. We expect to identify 50,000-100,000 previously uncharacterized transient interactions in human cells, dramatically expanding the known interactome and revealing regulatory connections invisible to conventional approaches. Our analysis of PTM-mediated regulation will elucidate molecular mechanisms by which cells dynamically control interaction networks, identifying specific phosphorylation sites, acetylation marks, and other modifications that act as molecular switches. This will provide mechanistic insight into signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle control. Context-dependent network analysis will reveal how interaction landscapes change across cell types, developmental stages, and disease states, explaining how the same proteome generates diverse cellular behaviors. Network topology analysis will uncover organizational principles governing transient interaction networks, identifying regulatory motifs that enable ultrasensitive responses, signal integration, and robust decision-making. These insights will establish new frameworks for understanding cellular information processing.\n\nBroader Impacts Across Biology and Medicine. The resources and insights generated will impact diverse areas of biology. In systems biology, our dynamic interaction atlas will enable more accurate modeling of cellular processes, moving beyond static networks to dynamic, context-dependent models. In structural biology, integration of interaction data with AlphaFold predictions will validate and extend structural modeling approaches, identifying cases where predicted structures accurately capture transient interactions. In drug discovery, understanding transient interactions will reveal new therapeutic targets and explain drug mechanisms of action, particularly for drugs targeting signaling pathways. Disease-associated mutations mapped to transient interaction interfaces will provide mechanistic insights into genetic diseases and cancer, potentially identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In synthetic biology, understanding principles governing transient interactions will inform design of engineered regulatory circuits and biosensors.\n\nTraining and Workforce Development. The project will train the next generation of data-savvy researchers through multiple mechanisms. We will support 4-6 graduate students and postdocs as core team members, providing intensive training in data integration, machine learning, structural biology, and network analysis. These trainees will gain expertise spanning multiple disciplines, preparing them for leadership roles in data-driven biology. We will develop comprehensive training modules covering data integration strategies, machine learning for biological data, network analysis methods, and structural bioinformatics. These modules will be offered as intensive workshops at major conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, Biophysical Society) and as online courses, reaching hundreds of trainees. All training materials will be publicly available, enabling self-directed learning. We will establish a summer internship program bringing undergraduate students from diverse institutions into the project, providing research experiences in computational biology. We will prioritize recruitment of students from underrepresented groups and primarily undergraduate institutions.\n\nDissemination and Publication Strategy. Results will be disseminated through multiple channels ensuring broad impact. We will publish 6-8 high-impact papers in journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Molecular Cell, Nature Methods, and Nucleic Acids Research, covering the integrated atlas, machine learning methods, context-dependent networks, and biological insights. All publications will be open access, ensuring unrestricted availability. We will present findings at major conferences including ISMB, RECOMB, Biophysical Society, ASCB, and Keystone Symposia, engaging diverse scientific communities. The Dynamic Interaction Atlas will launch with comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and example use cases, supported by webinars and user workshops. We will engage with database communities (BioGRID, STRING, IntAct) to ensure interoperability and data sharing. We will establish a user community through mailing lists and forums, providing support and gathering feedback for continuous improvement.\n\nLong-term Vision and Sustainability. Beyond the funding period, we envision this project catalyzing a paradigm shift toward dynamic, context-aware models of cellular regulation. The resources developed will serve as community infrastructure, analogous to how PDB and UniProt serve structural biology and protein science. We will pursue additional funding to expand coverage to additional organisms, integrate emerging data types (single-cell proteomics, in vivo crosslinking), and develop predictive models of interaction dynamics. We will establish partnerships with experimental groups to validate predictions, creating a virtuous cycle of prediction and validation. The interdisciplinary collaborations established will persist beyond this project, fostering continued innovation at disciplinary interfaces. Ultimately, this synthesis project will illuminate protein interaction dark matter, revealing the dynamic regulatory networks that enable cellular life.",

        "background_and_significance": "Mitochondria are essential organelles that originated from an ancient endosymbiotic event approximately 1.5 billion years ago, when an alphaproteobacterium was engulfed by an archaeal host cell. This endosymbiosis fundamentally transformed eukaryotic evolution, providing the bioenergetic capacity necessary for complex multicellular life. However, this partnership created an unprecedented evolutionary challenge: two genomes with different inheritance patterns, mutation rates, and selective pressures must maintain functional compatibility to sustain cellular respiration and energy production. Despite over a century of research since mitochondria were first described, the mechanisms governing mitochondrial-nuclear (mitonuclear) coevolution remain one of the most compelling unsolved puzzles in molecular and cellular biology.\n\nThe mitochondrial genome has undergone dramatic reduction since endosymbiosis, with most ancestral genes transferred to the nucleus. Modern mitochondrial genomes typically encode only 13-37 proteins, along with essential tRNAs and rRNAs, while the nucleus encodes over 1,000 proteins that function in mitochondria. This creates an obligate interdependence: mitochondrial-encoded proteins must physically interact with nuclear-encoded partners to form functional complexes of the electron transport chain, ATP synthase, and other critical systems. The maintenance of this compatibility is particularly challenging given that mitochondrial genomes evolve 10-100 times faster than nuclear genomes in animals, experience different selective pressures due to maternal inheritance in most species, and accumulate mutations that can be deleterious when combined with certain nuclear backgrounds.\n\nRecent research has revealed that mitonuclear incompatibilities have profound consequences across biological scales. At the molecular level, mismatches between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits can disrupt protein complex assembly, reduce respiratory efficiency, and increase reactive oxygen species production. Population genetic studies have demonstrated that mitonuclear interactions contribute to local adaptation, with certain mitochondrial haplotypes showing fitness advantages only in specific nuclear backgrounds. Evolutionary studies have implicated mitonuclear incompatibilities in reproductive isolation and speciation, particularly in hybrid zones where divergent populations meet. In humans, the interaction between mitochondrial variants and nuclear genetic backgrounds influences susceptibility to metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging-related phenotypes. Despite these insights, our understanding remains fragmented across disciplines and taxonomic groups.\n\nSeveral critical gaps limit our comprehension of mitonuclear coevolution. First, most studies focus on single species or narrow taxonomic groups, preventing identification of universal principles versus lineage-specific patterns. Second, research typically examines either sequence evolution or functional consequences, rarely integrating both perspectives. Third, the field lacks comprehensive catalogs of mitonuclear interactions and their evolutionary dynamics across the tree of life. Fourth, we cannot reliably predict which mitochondrial-nuclear combinations will be compatible or incompatible, limiting our ability to understand hybrid breakdown, disease susceptibility, and conservation challenges in fragmented populations. Finally, the computational and analytical tools needed to detect compensatory evolution and coordinated selection across two genomes with vastly different properties remain underdeveloped.\n\nThis synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the explosion of genomic data provides unprecedented opportunities to analyze mitonuclear evolution across thousands of species, from protists to plants to animals. Public databases now contain complete mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, population-level variation data, gene expression profiles, and protein interaction networks for diverse taxa. Second, advances in computational biology enable sophisticated analyses of coevolution, including detection of epistatic interactions, compensatory mutations, and coordinated selection that were previously intractable. Third, the biomedical relevance of mitonuclear interactions is increasingly recognized, with implications for personalized medicine, mitochondrial replacement therapy, and understanding complex diseases. Fourth, conservation biology faces urgent challenges related to mitonuclear incompatibilities in hybrid populations and fragmented habitats, requiring predictive frameworks. Finally, this project addresses fundamental questions about organellar evolution, genome architecture, and the maintenance of genetic systems that are central to cellular and molecular biology but require integration across traditionally separate disciplines. By synthesizing existing data through collaborative, transdisciplinary approaches, we can transform scattered observations into comprehensive understanding of one of evolution's most important partnerships.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and clear predictions that will advance our understanding of mitonuclear coevolution.\n\nResearch Question 1: What are the universal patterns and lineage-specific features of mitonuclear coevolution across eukaryotes? We hypothesize that while some coevolutionary mechanisms are conserved across all eukaryotes due to fundamental biochemical constraints, others vary among lineages due to differences in life history, population structure, and inheritance patterns. Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) genes encoding subunits of the electron transport chain complexes will show stronger signatures of compensatory evolution than other mitochondrial-nuclear gene pairs across all taxa; (H1b) lineages with biparental mitochondrial inheritance will exhibit different coevolutionary dynamics than those with strict maternal inheritance; (H1c) taxa with larger effective population sizes will show more efficient purging of mildly deleterious mitonuclear incompatibilities. We will test these hypotheses by conducting phylogenetically-controlled comparative analyses across at least 50 eukaryotic lineages spanning protists, fungi, plants, and animals, examining rates of molecular evolution, signatures of selection, and patterns of compensatory substitutions.\n\nResearch Question 2: How do compensatory mutations maintain mitonuclear compatibility, and can we predict which mutations require compensation? We hypothesize that compensatory evolution follows predictable patterns based on protein structure, interaction interfaces, and functional constraints. Our predictions include: (H2a) mutations in mitochondrial-encoded proteins that alter residues at physical interaction interfaces with nuclear-encoded partners will be more likely to have compensatory mutations in nuclear genes; (H2b) the time lag between a mitochondrial mutation and its nuclear compensatory mutation correlates with the fitness cost of the incompatibility; (H2c) compensatory mutations cluster in specific functional domains and show convergent evolution across independent lineages. We will test these hypotheses by developing machine learning algorithms trained on known compensatory mutation pairs, validated through structural modeling of protein complexes, and applied to detect novel compensatory evolution across our dataset. Success will be measured by our ability to predict experimentally-validated incompatibilities from sequence data alone.\n\nResearch Question 3: How does mitonuclear coevolution constrain or facilitate evolutionary innovation and adaptation? We hypothesize that mitonuclear interactions create both constraints and opportunities for evolution. Specifically: (H3a) lineages with higher rates of mitochondrial evolution will show corresponding acceleration in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, but this will constrain diversification rates; (H3b) episodes of rapid environmental change will be associated with coordinated selection on mitonuclear gene sets; (H3c) gene duplication events in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes will be more likely to be retained when they provide flexibility for maintaining compatibility with diverse mitochondrial backgrounds. We will test these hypotheses by integrating phylogenomic analyses with environmental data, examining diversification rates in relation to mitonuclear evolutionary dynamics, and analyzing the fates of duplicated genes across lineages.\n\nResearch Question 4: What are the molecular signatures and functional consequences of mitonuclear incompatibilities in hybrid zones and disease states? We hypothesize that incompatibilities arise through predictable molecular mechanisms that can be detected in sequence and expression data. Our predictions include: (H4a) hybrid breakdown in natural populations correlates with specific mitonuclear genotype combinations that show expression dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes; (H4b) human mitochondrial variants associated with disease risk show population-specific effects due to nuclear genetic background differences; (H4c) mitonuclear incompatibilities manifest as stoichiometric imbalances in protein complex assembly and altered metabolic flux. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing population genomic data from hybrid zones across multiple species, integrating human mitochondrial disease databases with population-specific nuclear genome data, and examining gene expression coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.\n\nExpected outcomes include: (1) a comprehensive catalog of mitonuclear gene pairs under coordinated selection across eukaryotes; (2) validated computational tools for predicting compensatory mutations and compatibility; (3) quantitative models of how mitonuclear interactions influence evolutionary rates and constraints; (4) identification of specific mitonuclear incompatibilities contributing to hybrid breakdown and disease; (5) publicly available databases and analysis workflows enabling the research community to explore mitonuclear evolution in any system. Each hypothesis will be validated through multiple independent approaches, including phylogenetic analyses, population genetic tests, structural modeling, and comparison with experimental data from the literature. The integration of predictions across multiple hypotheses will provide robust tests of our overall framework for understanding mitonuclear coevolution.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our synthesis approach integrates diverse data types and analytical methods, organized into four interconnected work packages that address our research questions. The project will span three years with specific milestones and deliverables.\n\nWork Package 1: Data Integration and Database Construction (Months 1-9). We will compile and standardize data from multiple public sources. Genomic data will be obtained from NCBI GenBank (mitochondrial and nuclear genomes for >5,000 species), Ensembl (annotated genomes for model organisms), and the 1000 Genomes Project (human population variation). Population genomic datasets will be sourced from PopFly, DrosRTEC, 1001 Genomes (Arabidopsis), and published studies with data in NCBI SRA. Gene expression data will be compiled from GEO, ArrayExpress, and GTEx (human tissues). Protein interaction data will be obtained from STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct databases. Mitochondrial disease associations will be compiled from MITOMAP, ClinVar, and published GWAS studies. We will develop a relational database architecture linking mitochondrial genomes, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (identified through MitoCarta and ortholog mapping), protein interactions, expression profiles, and population variation. Quality control procedures will standardize annotations, identify orthologs using reciprocal best BLAST and phylogenetic approaches, and ensure data completeness. Deliverable: MitoNuclear Coevolution Database (MNCD) with web interface for community access.\n\nWork Package 2: Phylogenomic and Comparative Analyses (Months 6-18). We will conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses to identify patterns of mitonuclear coevolution. First, we will construct species phylogenies using nuclear genome data and mitochondrial phylogenies, comparing topologies to identify cytonuclear discordance. Second, we will estimate evolutionary rates (dN/dS ratios) for all mitochondrial genes and their nuclear-encoded interaction partners across the phylogeny using PAML and HyPhy. Third, we will test for correlated evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genes using phylogenetically independent contrasts and Bayesian approaches implemented in BayesTraits. Fourth, we will identify compensatory mutations using several complementary methods: mirror tree approaches comparing distance matrices of interacting proteins, coevolution analysis using CAPS and EVcoupling, and explicit detection of epistatic substitutions using phylogenetic methods. Fifth, we will map mutations onto protein structures (obtained from PDB and AlphaFold predictions) to determine whether compensatory changes occur at interaction interfaces. Statistical significance will be assessed using permutation tests and phylogenetic simulations. We will conduct separate analyses for major taxonomic groups and test for differences in coevolutionary patterns using phylogenetic ANOVA. Deliverable: Comprehensive catalog of mitonuclear gene pairs showing coordinated evolution, compensatory mutation database, and analytical pipeline for detecting coevolution.\n\nWork Package 3: Population Genomic and Expression Analyses (Months 12-24). We will analyze population-level variation to understand contemporary mitonuclear dynamics. First, we will characterize mitochondrial haplotype diversity and nuclear genetic variation at mitochondrial-targeted genes across populations. Second, we will test for mitonuclear linkage disequilibrium and epistatic fitness effects using association mapping approaches. Third, we will identify signatures of coordinated selection using extended haplotype homozygosity tests and composite likelihood methods. Fourth, we will analyze gene expression data to quantify coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression across tissues, developmental stages, and environmental conditions using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression approaches. Fifth, we will examine stoichiometric balance of protein complex subunits using expression data and test whether mitonuclear incompatibilities manifest as expression imbalances. For hybrid zone analyses, we will identify mitonuclear genotype combinations associated with reduced fitness using genomic cline analyses and test for expression dysregulation in hybrids. For human disease associations, we will test for interactions between mitochondrial variants and nuclear genetic backgrounds using logistic regression models controlling for population structure. Deliverable: Population-specific mitonuclear compatibility maps, expression coordination networks, and disease risk prediction models.\n\nWork Package 4: Predictive Modeling and Tool Development (Months 18-36). We will develop computational tools for predicting mitonuclear compatibility and detecting compensatory evolution. First, we will train machine learning models (random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning approaches) to predict compensatory mutations using features including evolutionary rates, structural properties, expression patterns, and interaction network topology. Training data will include validated compensatory mutations from our phylogenomic analyses and experimental literature. Model performance will be evaluated using cross-validation and independent test sets. Second, we will develop compatibility prediction tools that integrate sequence, structure, and expression data to assess whether specific mitonuclear combinations are likely to be functional. These will be validated against experimental data on hybrid fitness and disease associations. Third, we will create user-friendly software packages and web interfaces enabling researchers to apply our methods to new species and datasets. All tools will be open-source, well-documented, and include tutorial datasets. Deliverable: Software suite for mitonuclear coevolution analysis, compatibility prediction tools, and comprehensive documentation.\n\nTimeline and Milestones: Year 1 - Database construction complete (Month 9), initial phylogenomic analyses (Month 12); Year 2 - Comparative analyses across major lineages (Month 18), population genomic analyses (Month 24); Year 3 - Predictive model development (Month 30), tool validation and dissemination (Month 36). The project will include quarterly virtual meetings, two in-person working group meetings (Months 12 and 24), and annual training workshops for graduate students and postdocs.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This synthesis project will deliver transformative outcomes across multiple dimensions, advancing fundamental knowledge while providing practical tools and training opportunities.\n\nScientific Contributions: The project will resolve long-standing questions about mitonuclear coevolution by providing the first comprehensive, quantitative framework spanning the diversity of eukaryotic life. We will establish universal principles governing how two genomes with vastly different properties maintain functional compatibility, while identifying lineage-specific adaptations. The catalog of compensatory mutations will reveal the molecular mechanisms by which evolution solves the compatibility problem, informing theories of molecular evolution, epistasis, and genetic constraints. By quantifying how mitonuclear interactions influence evolutionary rates and diversification, we will advance understanding of macroevolutionary patterns. The identification of specific incompatibilities in hybrid zones will provide concrete examples of genetic mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation and speciation. For human health, linking mitochondrial variants to nuclear genetic backgrounds will enable more precise understanding of disease susceptibility and potentially inform personalized medicine approaches. These contributions will be disseminated through high-impact publications in journals such as Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS, Molecular Biology and Evolution, and PLoS Biology, with separate papers addressing each major research question plus methods papers describing our computational approaches.\n\nDatabase and Tool Resources: The MitoNuclear Coevolution Database (MNCD) will become a community resource analogous to successful databases like FlyBase or TAIR, providing centralized access to integrated mitonuclear data across thousands of species. The database will include interactive visualization tools, allowing researchers to explore coevolutionary patterns in their study systems. Our software suite for detecting compensatory evolution and predicting compatibility will enable researchers to apply these approaches to new species, populations, or clinical datasets. These tools will be particularly valuable for conservation biologists assessing risks of outbreeding depression, evolutionary biologists studying adaptation and speciation, and biomedical researchers investigating mitochondrial diseases. All resources will be maintained beyond the project period through partnerships with established bioinformatics centers and will follow FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We will deposit all analysis workflows in repositories like GitHub and WorkflowHub, ensuring reproducibility and enabling community contributions.\n\nBroader Impacts: This project addresses societal challenges in health and conservation. Understanding mitonuclear interactions has direct relevance to mitochondrial diseases affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals, potentially informing therapeutic strategies and genetic counseling. For conservation, our compatibility prediction tools will help assess risks when managing small or fragmented populations where mitonuclear mismatches may arise. The project will advance open science practices by making all data, code, and workflows publicly available, serving as a model for synthesis research. Our commitment to transparency includes pre-registration of analyses, version-controlled code repositories, and detailed documentation of all methods.\n\nTraining and Workforce Development: The project will train the next generation of data-savvy scientists through multiple mechanisms. We will support 6-8 graduate students and postdocs as working group members, providing hands-on experience in collaborative, interdisciplinary research. Annual training workshops (5 days each) will teach 20-25 trainees per year skills in phylogenomics, population genomics, machine learning, and data integration. Workshop materials will be made publicly available as online courses. We will prioritize recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with diversity-focused programs. Trainees will gain experience in team science, develop professional networks spanning disciplines, and acquire computational skills highly valued in both academic and industry careers. We will track trainee outcomes and career trajectories to assess long-term impacts.\n\nFollow-up Research and Sustainability: This synthesis project will catalyze numerous follow-up studies. The hypotheses generated about specific compensatory mutations can be tested experimentally through genome editing approaches. The identification of mitonuclear incompatibilities in natural populations will motivate field studies examining fitness consequences. The disease associations will suggest clinical studies and therapeutic targets. We will actively foster these connections by organizing symposia at major conferences (SMBE, Evolution, ASCB) and publishing perspective pieces highlighting research opportunities. The database and tools will be sustained through institutional support and potential future funding for maintenance and expansion. We envision MNCD becoming a dynamic resource that grows with community contributions, similar to successful community databases. The interdisciplinary networks established will persist beyond the project, potentially leading to new collaborative grants and research programs. Ultimately, this synthesis will establish mitonuclear coevolution as a mature research field with standardized methods, comprehensive data resources, and clear frameworks for future investigation.",

        "background_and_significance": "Allostery represents one of the most elegant and ubiquitous regulatory mechanisms in biology, enabling proteins to respond to signals at one site by inducing functional changes at distant locations. First described by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux in 1965, allostery governs fundamental cellular processes including signal transduction, metabolic regulation, gene expression, and immune responses. Despite six decades of research, our understanding of allosteric mechanisms remains largely phenomenological, with limited predictive power for identifying allosteric sites or anticipating the functional consequences of mutations. This knowledge gap has profound implications for both basic biology and translational medicine, as approximately 40% of disease-associated mutations affect protein function through allosteric disruption rather than direct active site perturbation.\n\nThe classical view of allostery emphasized conformational changes between discrete structural states, exemplified by hemoglobin's cooperative oxygen binding. However, recent advances in structural biology, biophysics, and computational chemistry have revealed that allostery operates through diverse mechanisms including dynamic fluctuations, entropic redistribution, and subtle conformational shifts that may not be apparent in static structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has demonstrated that proteins exist as ensembles of interconverting conformations, with allosteric signals propagating through shifts in these conformational populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have identified networks of correlated motions connecting distant protein regions, suggesting that allostery exploits pre-existing communication pathways encoded in protein architecture. Deep mutational scanning experiments have revealed that mutations throughout protein structures can affect function, indicating widespread allosteric coupling beyond traditionally recognized regulatory domains.\n\nDespite these advances, several critical gaps limit our understanding of allosteric mechanisms. First, we lack comprehensive maps of allosteric pathways across protein fold families, making it difficult to identify general principles versus family-specific features. Second, existing computational methods for predicting allosteric sites show limited accuracy and often disagree with experimental observations. Third, the relationship between protein dynamics, evolutionary conservation, and allosteric function remains poorly understood. Fourth, we cannot reliably predict how specific mutations will affect allosteric communication, hampering efforts to interpret disease variants and engineer proteins with desired regulatory properties. Finally, the field lacks standardized datasets, analysis protocols, and benchmarking frameworks for comparing different computational approaches.\n\nThe timing is ideal for a comprehensive synthesis project addressing these gaps. The Protein Data Bank now contains over 200,000 structures, including thousands of proteins captured in multiple conformational states. AlphaFold has generated structure predictions for nearly all known proteins, providing unprecedented coverage of protein structure space. Deep mutational scanning studies have systematically characterized functional effects of mutations in hundreds of proteins, creating rich datasets for validating allosteric predictions. Molecular dynamics simulations have accumulated petabytes of trajectory data in repositories like GPCRmd and MoDEL. Advanced machine learning methods, particularly graph neural networks and transformer architectures, offer powerful tools for identifying patterns in complex structural data. These resources, previously scattered across disciplines and databases, can now be integrated to address fundamental questions about allosteric communication.\n\nThis synthesis project is significant for multiple reasons. Scientifically, it addresses the fundamental question of how proteins encode regulatory information in their three-dimensional structures, moving beyond the sequence-structure-function paradigm to incorporate dynamics and long-range coupling. Methodologically, it will establish frameworks for integrating heterogeneous data types—static structures, dynamic simulations, evolutionary information, and functional measurements—to generate mechanistic insights. Practically, understanding allosteric mechanisms will enable rational design of allosteric drugs, which offer advantages over active-site inhibitors including greater specificity, reduced toxicity, and ability to modulate rather than abolish protein function. The project will also train a new generation of researchers in integrative structural biology, equipping them with skills in data science, structural analysis, and collaborative research essential for modern molecular biology. By creating open-access databases, prediction tools, and standardized protocols, this project will establish infrastructure benefiting the entire structural biology community and accelerating discovery in protein science.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project will address four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to decode the principles governing allosteric communication in proteins.\n\nResearch Question 1: What are the structural and dynamic features that define allosteric pathways in proteins? We hypothesize that allosteric communication occurs through conserved networks of residues that exhibit correlated motions, evolutionary co-variation, and specific structural connectivity patterns. We predict that these pathways will be identifiable through integration of structural analysis (contact networks, geometric parameters), dynamic information (molecular dynamics correlations, NMR relaxation data), and evolutionary signals (co-evolution analysis, conservation patterns). We expect to find that allosteric pathways are not uniformly distributed but concentrate along specific structural elements such as secondary structure interfaces, domain boundaries, and hinge regions. Testing this hypothesis will involve systematic analysis of proteins with known allosteric mechanisms, comparing pathway features between functional and non-functional variants, and validating predictions against experimental mutagenesis data. We will quantify pathway robustness by examining how structural perturbations propagate through identified networks and whether alternative pathways exist for signal transmission.\n\nResearch Question 2: Are there universal principles of allosteric communication that transcend protein fold families, or is allostery primarily fold-specific? We hypothesize that while specific residues and pathways vary across protein families, general organizational principles govern allosteric communication across all proteins. These principles may include: (1) hierarchical organization where local perturbations propagate through intermediate relay stations to distant sites; (2) exploitation of intrinsic protein dynamics where allosteric signals modulate pre-existing conformational fluctuations; (3) energetic coupling through networks of weak interactions rather than single strong connections; and (4) redundancy where multiple pathways provide robustness against mutations. We predict that machine learning models trained on diverse protein families will identify these universal features, enabling cross-family predictions. Testing will involve training models on specific fold families and evaluating their performance on unrelated folds, comparing pathway architectures across evolutionarily distant proteins with analogous functions, and examining whether engineered allosteric switches in one fold family follow principles derived from others.\n\nResearch Question 3: How do disease-associated mutations disrupt allosteric communication, and can we predict pathogenic allosteric effects? We hypothesize that pathogenic mutations disrupt allostery through distinct mechanisms including: (1) breaking critical pathway connections by altering residue contacts; (2) rigidifying or over-stabilizing structures to prevent conformational transitions; (3) introducing competing interactions that redirect signal flow; and (4) destabilizing protein structures to eliminate functional conformations. We predict that integrating structural context, dynamic properties, and evolutionary constraints will enable accurate classification of mutations as pathway-disrupting versus benign. Specifically, we expect that mutations at evolutionarily conserved positions within identified allosteric pathways will show stronger functional effects than mutations at equally conserved positions outside pathways. Testing will involve analyzing thousands of disease variants from ClinVar and other databases, correlating predicted pathway disruption with clinical phenotypes, and validating predictions against deep mutational scanning datasets that systematically measure functional effects.\n\nResearch Question 4: Can we develop generalizable computational tools for predicting allosteric sites and designing allosteric modulators? We hypothesize that integration of multiple data types—structure, dynamics, evolution, and function—through machine learning will enable accurate prediction of allosteric sites and mutation effects. We predict that graph neural networks operating on protein structure networks will outperform sequence-based or structure-only methods by capturing both local geometry and long-range connectivity. We expect that models incorporating dynamic information will show improved performance over static structure-based approaches, particularly for proteins where allostery involves conformational selection or population shifts. Testing will involve rigorous benchmarking against experimental datasets, including blind predictions on newly characterized allosteric proteins, cross-validation across protein families, and comparison with existing computational methods. Success will be measured by precision and recall for allosteric site prediction, correlation between predicted and measured mutation effects, and ability to identify cryptic allosteric sites not apparent from structure alone.\n\nExpected outcomes include: (1) comprehensive maps of allosteric pathways for major protein fold families; (2) quantitative models relating structural features to allosteric coupling strength; (3) validated computational tools for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects; (4) mechanistic understanding of how different protein architectures implement allosteric regulation; (5) design principles for engineering allosteric control into proteins; and (6) curated databases linking structures, pathways, mutations, and functional effects. These outcomes will be validated through comparison with experimental data, cross-validation across datasets, and prospective predictions on newly characterized systems.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This synthesis project will integrate diverse data sources and analytical methods through a collaborative framework involving structural biologists, biophysicists, computational chemists, and machine learning experts. The project is organized into five interconnected phases over a three-year timeline.\n\nPhase 1: Data Collection and Curation (Months 1-6). We will compile comprehensive datasets from multiple public repositories. Structural data will be obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), focusing on proteins with multiple conformational states (>15,000 structures), and AlphaFold Database predictions (>200 million structures). We will extract proteins with experimentally validated allosteric mechanisms from literature curation and databases including ASD (Allosteric Database), ASBench, and CASBench. Molecular dynamics trajectories will be collected from GPCRmd, MoDEL, and DESRES repositories, supplemented by targeted simulations on representative proteins from each major fold family. Deep mutational scanning data will be compiled from published studies and repositories including ProteinGym and MaveDB, focusing on proteins with known allosteric mechanisms. NMR dynamics data including relaxation parameters, chemical shift perturbations, and hydrogen-exchange rates will be extracted from BMRB and literature. Evolutionary information will be obtained through multiple sequence alignments from Pfam, InterPro, and custom alignments generated using HHblits. Disease variant data will be compiled from ClinVar, COSMIC, and UniProt, focusing on variants with functional characterization. All datasets will be standardized, quality-controlled, and integrated into a unified database with consistent identifiers and metadata.\n\nPhase 2: Structural and Dynamic Analysis (Months 4-12). For each protein structure, we will construct residue interaction networks where nodes represent amino acids and edges represent physical contacts, with edge weights reflecting interaction strength. Network analysis will identify communities (densely connected regions), betweenness centrality (residues connecting distant regions), and shortest paths between functional sites. We will calculate geometric parameters including inter-residue distances, angles, and solvent accessibility across conformational states to quantify structural changes. Molecular dynamics trajectories will be analyzed using dynamic cross-correlation matrices to identify residues with correlated motions, principal component analysis to extract dominant motions, and mutual information to quantify coupling between residues. Perturbation response scanning will computationally predict how local perturbations propagate through structures. Evolutionary coupling analysis using methods like EVcouplings and Gremlin will identify co-evolving residue pairs indicating functional constraints. Integration of structural networks with dynamic correlations and evolutionary couplings will generate comprehensive allosteric pathway maps. This phase will be led by structural biologists and biophysicists with expertise in protein dynamics.\n\nPhase 3: Machine Learning Model Development (Months 10-20). We will develop multiple complementary computational approaches for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects. Graph neural networks will operate on protein structure graphs, learning representations that capture both local geometry and global topology. Input features will include residue type, structural properties (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, B-factors), dynamic properties (flexibility, correlation with other residues), and evolutionary information (conservation, co-evolution). Transformer-based models will process protein sequences with structural and dynamic annotations to predict allosteric residues and pathways. Ensemble methods will combine predictions from multiple models to improve robustness. Models will be trained on curated datasets with known allosteric sites and validated mutations, using cross-validation within protein families and testing on held-out families to assess generalizability. For mutation effect prediction, we will develop models that take wild-type and mutant structures (or predictions) as input and predict functional consequences. Feature importance analysis will identify which structural and dynamic properties most strongly predict allosteric behavior, providing mechanistic insights. This phase will be led by machine learning experts and computational chemists.\n\nPhase 4: Integration and Validation (Months 18-30). We will integrate findings across protein families to identify universal principles versus family-specific features. Comparative analysis will examine whether pathway architectures, residue properties, and coupling mechanisms differ systematically across fold types, protein sizes, or functional classes. Rigorous validation will compare predictions against multiple experimental datasets including: (1) newly published allosteric proteins not in training data; (2) deep mutational scanning results for quantitative mutation effects; (3) NMR chemical shift perturbations mapping signal propagation; (4) hydrogen-deuterium exchange data revealing conformational changes; and (5) disease variants with clinical phenotypes. Statistical analysis will quantify prediction accuracy, identify failure modes, and guide model refinement. We will also perform case studies on medically important proteins (kinases, GPCRs, transcription factors) to demonstrate practical applications. This phase involves the entire collaborative team.\n\nPhase 5: Tool Development and Dissemination (Months 24-36). We will create publicly accessible resources including: (1) AlloPathDB, a database of allosteric pathways with interactive visualization; (2) AlloPredict, a web server for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects; (3) standardized analysis protocols and software packages for pathway identification; and (4) benchmark datasets for evaluating new methods. Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and training workshops will ensure community adoption. All code will be open-source and deposited in GitHub repositories. Results will be published in high-impact journals and presented at conferences. We will organize a symposium bringing together experimental and computational researchers to discuss findings and future directions.\n\nTimeline Milestones: Month 6 - Complete data curation; Month 12 - Pathway maps for 50 protein families; Month 18 - Initial machine learning models; Month 24 - Validated prediction tools; Month 30 - Complete cross-family analysis; Month 36 - Public release of all resources and final publications. The collaborative framework is essential because no single lab possesses expertise in structural biology, molecular dynamics, machine learning, and experimental validation required for this integrative project.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes advancing both fundamental understanding of protein allostery and practical applications in drug discovery and protein engineering.\n\nScientific Contributions: The project will produce the first comprehensive atlas of allosteric pathways across major protein fold families, revealing how different structural architectures implement long-range communication. By analyzing thousands of proteins, we will identify universal principles governing allosteric signal transmission, including the structural features, dynamic properties, and evolutionary constraints that define functional pathways. This will fundamentally advance our understanding of how proteins encode regulatory information beyond active sites, addressing a central question in molecular biology. The integration of static structures with dynamic information will demonstrate that allostery cannot be fully understood from structures alone, establishing dynamics as an essential component of protein function. Our analysis of disease mutations will reveal how genetic variants disrupt allosteric communication, providing mechanistic insights into molecular pathogenesis and explaining why mutations distant from active sites can abolish function. The project will also establish quantitative relationships between structural perturbations and functional consequences, moving the field from qualitative descriptions toward predictive models.\n\nMethodological Advances: We will develop and validate computational tools that significantly outperform existing methods for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects. These tools will integrate multiple data types—structure, dynamics, evolution, and function—through advanced machine learning approaches, demonstrating the power of data synthesis for addressing complex biological questions. The standardized analysis protocols and benchmark datasets will enable rigorous comparison of different computational approaches, accelerating methodological development across the field. Our framework for integrating heterogeneous data sources will serve as a model for other synthesis projects in structural biology and beyond. The machine learning models will be interpretable, revealing which features most strongly predict allosteric behavior and thereby generating mechanistic hypotheses testable through experiments.\n\nPractical Applications: Understanding allosteric mechanisms will enable rational design of allosteric drugs, which offer significant advantages over traditional active-site inhibitors. Allosteric modulators can achieve greater specificity by targeting regulatory sites unique to specific protein family members, reduce toxicity by modulating rather than abolishing protein function, and overcome resistance mechanisms that affect active sites. Our prediction tools will identify cryptic allosteric sites not apparent from structure inspection, expanding the druggable proteome. The ability to predict mutation effects will improve interpretation of genetic variants in clinical settings, distinguishing pathogenic from benign variants and guiding personalized medicine approaches. For protein engineering, our design principles will enable introduction of allosteric control into enzymes and other proteins, creating biosensors, controllable therapeutics, and optimized industrial biocatalysts.\n\nCommunity Resources: The project will deliver multiple open-access resources benefiting the broader scientific community. AlloPathDB will provide a centralized repository of allosteric pathway information with interactive visualization tools, enabling researchers to explore communication networks in their proteins of interest. AlloPredict will offer user-friendly web interfaces for predicting allosteric sites and mutation effects without requiring computational expertise. Standardized datasets and protocols will facilitate method development and benchmarking. All software will be open-source with comprehensive documentation, and training workshops will build community capacity in integrative structural biology approaches. These resources will be maintained beyond the project period through partnerships with established bioinformatics centers.\n\nTraining and Workforce Development: The project will train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in integrative approaches combining structural biology, biophysics, computational chemistry, and data science—skills increasingly essential for modern molecular biology research. Trainees will gain experience in collaborative, team-based science and learn to work across disciplinary boundaries. We will organize annual workshops providing hands-on training in data synthesis methods, reaching researchers beyond the immediate project team. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research infrastructure, promoting diversity in the scientific workforce.\n\nDissemination Strategy: Results will be published in high-impact journals including Nature, Science, Cell, and specialized journals like Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, PNAS, and eLife. We will publish multiple papers addressing different aspects: comprehensive pathway analysis, machine learning methods, disease mutation analysis, and specific case studies. All publications will be open-access to maximize accessibility. Preprints will be posted on bioRxiv immediately upon completion. We will present findings at major conferences including Biophysical Society, Protein Society, and RECOMB. A dedicated project website will provide regular updates, tutorials, and community forums. We will engage with pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms to facilitate translation of findings into drug discovery applications.\n\nLong-term Vision: This project will establish allostery as a central organizing principle in protein biology, comparable to the genetic code or protein folding principles. The resources and methods developed will enable a new generation of studies examining allosteric regulation in diverse biological contexts including signal transduction, metabolic regulation, and cellular decision-making. The framework for data synthesis will be applicable to other fundamental questions in molecular biology. We envision follow-up projects examining allosteric regulation in protein complexes, intrinsically disordered proteins, and membrane proteins. The prediction tools will be continuously updated as new data becomes available, ensuring sustained impact. Ultimately, this project will transform our ability to understand, predict, and manipulate protein regulation, with far-reaching implications for biology and medicine.",

        "background_and_significance": "Chromatin organization represents one of the most fundamental mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression, DNA replication, and genome stability. The three-dimensional architecture of chromatin creates functional compartments that bring regulatory elements into proximity with their target genes while insulating other regions from inappropriate interactions. Over the past two decades, chromosome conformation capture technologies, particularly Hi-C, have revolutionized our understanding of genome organization in model organisms, revealing hierarchical structures including chromosome territories, A/B compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops. These discoveries have primarily focused on mammalian systems, with landmark studies from the ENCODE and 4D Nucleome consortia establishing that disruption of chromatin architecture contributes to developmental disorders and cancer.\n\nDespite these advances, our understanding of chromatin organization remains heavily biased toward a narrow phylogenetic range. The vast majority of 3D genome studies have examined mammals, with additional work in Drosophila, C. elegans, and a handful of plant species through modENCODE and related efforts. This taxonomic sampling represents less than 0.01% of eukaryotic diversity, leaving fundamental questions unanswered about the evolutionary origins and conservation of chromatin organizational principles. Recent studies have revealed surprising diversity: while mammalian genomes display prominent TADs mediated by CTCF and cohesin, Drosophila shows weaker domain structures, C. elegans lacks clear TADs entirely, and plants exhibit unique chromatin features associated with their sessile lifestyle. These observations suggest that chromatin architecture may be more evolutionarily plastic than previously assumed, yet systematic comparative analyses across deep evolutionary time remain absent.\n\nThe significance of understanding chromatin evolution extends beyond academic curiosity. First, identifying truly conserved features of genome organization would reveal fundamental constraints and principles that govern all eukaryotic life, distinguishing universal requirements from lineage-specific adaptations. Second, evolutionary context is essential for interpreting human chromatin biology and disease mechanisms—features that appear essential in mammals may represent recent innovations rather than ancient requirements. Third, diverse organisms have evolved distinct solutions to common regulatory challenges, and understanding these alternatives could inspire novel therapeutic approaches and biotechnological applications. Fourth, many emerging model organisms and species of agricultural, ecological, or biomedical importance lack chromatin architecture data, limiting our ability to develop genetic tools and understand their unique biology.\n\nSeveral critical gaps impede progress in comparative chromatin biology. First, existing datasets are scattered across multiple repositories with inconsistent formats, quality standards, and metadata, making systematic comparison extremely challenging. Second, computational tools for chromatin analysis were developed for specific model organisms and often fail when applied to divergent species with different genome sizes, repeat contents, or chromosomal organizations. Third, identifying orthologous regulatory elements and architectural proteins across large evolutionary distances requires sophisticated phylogenetic and synteny analyses that integrate multiple data types. Fourth, no comprehensive framework exists for quantifying and comparing chromatin features across species while accounting for technical variation and biological differences in genome structure.\n\nThis synthesis project addresses these gaps by leveraging the explosion of publicly available chromatin data from diverse eukaryotes. Recent years have seen Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq datasets published for protists, fungi, plants, and numerous animal lineages, creating an unprecedented opportunity for comparative analysis. However, synthesizing these data requires expertise spanning chromatin biology, evolutionary genomics, computational biology, and comparative methods—a truly transdisciplinary effort beyond the scope of individual laboratories. The timing is ideal: sufficient taxonomic sampling now exists to address evolutionary questions, computational resources can handle genome-scale comparisons, and the field recognizes the need for evolutionary perspectives on genome organization. This project will transform scattered datasets into integrated knowledge, revealing how chromatin architecture evolved and establishing principles that govern genome organization across all eukaryotic life.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four overarching research questions, each with specific testable hypotheses and predicted outcomes that will fundamentally advance our understanding of chromatin evolution and genome organization.\n\nResearch Question 1: What are the ancestral and derived features of eukaryotic chromatin architecture? We hypothesize that while specific organizational structures like TADs show lineage-specific variation, fundamental principles of compartmentalization and loop formation represent ancestral features present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). We predict that: (a) A/B compartmentalization correlating with active/inactive chromatin will be universal across eukaryotes, as it reflects fundamental biophysical properties of chromatin states; (b) Contact enrichment between regulatory elements and promoters will be conserved, though the proteins mediating these interactions may differ; (c) Insulation between chromatin domains will be present across eukaryotes but achieved through diverse molecular mechanisms; (d) TAD-like structures will correlate with the presence of specific architectural proteins (CTCF, condensins, cohesins) and their evolutionary history. We will test these hypotheses by systematically analyzing Hi-C data across 50+ species spanning major eukaryotic supergroups, identifying shared organizational features using phylogenetically-informed comparative methods, and correlating architectural features with the presence/absence of candidate architectural proteins identified through comparative genomics.\n\nResearch Question 2: How do architectural proteins and their binding sites evolve, and how does this evolution shape genome organization? We hypothesize that while specific DNA-binding proteins like CTCF show limited phylogenetic distribution, functionally analogous proteins with convergent roles exist across eukaryotes, and that binding site evolution constrains organizational plasticity. Our predictions include: (a) Architectural protein families will show birth-and-death evolution with lineage-specific expansions correlating with organizational complexity; (b) Binding motifs for architectural proteins will be enriched at domain boundaries across species, even when the proteins themselves are not orthologous; (c) Syntenic regions will maintain similar organizational features despite sequence divergence when architectural protein binding is conserved; (d) Loss of architectural proteins will correlate with alternative organizational mechanisms. We will test these hypotheses by performing comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of architectural protein families, identifying binding motifs through ChIP-seq data integration and de novo motif discovery, correlating motif presence with boundary positions across species, and analyzing organizational changes in lineages that have lost specific architectural proteins.\n\nResearch Question 3: What evolutionary forces and genomic constraints shape chromatin architecture? We hypothesize that genome organization reflects optimization under multiple constraints including genome size, gene density, regulatory complexity, and life history traits. We predict: (a) Compact genomes will show stronger, more defined organizational structures due to increased regulatory density; (b) Gene-dense regions will exhibit more complex loop structures connecting dispersed regulatory elements; (c) Organisms with complex development will show more elaborate chromatin architectures than those with simpler life cycles; (d) Chromatin organization will correlate with transcriptional complexity, with more organizational layers in organisms with extensive alternative splicing and cell-type-specific regulation. These hypotheses will be tested through quantitative analyses correlating organizational metrics (TAD strength, loop frequency, compartment definition) with genomic features (size, gene density, repeat content), life history traits, and transcriptional complexity measures across our phylogenetic sampling.\n\nResearch Question 4: How do lineage-specific innovations in chromatin organization enable unique regulatory strategies? We hypothesize that major evolutionary transitions (multicellularity, complex development, environmental adaptation) are associated with chromatin organizational innovations that enable new regulatory capabilities. Predictions include: (a) Independent origins of multicellularity will correlate with convergent evolution of enhancer-promoter loop structures; (b) Lineages with extreme environmental adaptations will show unique chromatin features supporting rapid transcriptional responses; (c) Organisms with complex cell-type diversity will exhibit more hierarchical organizational structures; (d) Regulatory innovations like X-chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting will be associated with novel architectural features. We will test these hypotheses through detailed case studies of specific lineages, comparing chromatin organization before and after major transitions, identifying lineage-specific organizational features through phylogenetic comparative methods, and correlating organizational innovations with regulatory capabilities documented in the literature.\n\nExpected outcomes include: quantitative metrics of organizational conservation and divergence across eukaryotes; identification of universal principles governing genome organization; evolutionary timelines for major architectural features; catalogs of architectural proteins and their binding sites across diverse species; predictive models linking genomic features to organizational properties; and mechanistic insights into how chromatin evolution enables regulatory innovation. These outcomes will be validated through consistency across multiple analytical approaches, agreement with experimental literature, and predictive power for species not included in initial analyses.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our comprehensive analytical approach integrates multiple data types and computational methods to address chromatin architecture evolution across eukaryotes. The project is organized into five integrated phases over a three-year timeline.\n\nPhase 1: Data Acquisition and Standardization (Months 1-6). We will systematically identify and acquire publicly available datasets from multiple repositories including ENCODE, modENCODE, 4D Nucleome, NCBI GEO, ENA, and organism-specific databases (e.g., WormBase, FlyBase, Phytozome, EnsemblGenomes). Target datasets include: Hi-C/Micro-C data from 50+ species spanning major eukaryotic supergroups (Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa, Archaeplastida, SAR, Excavata); ChIP-seq data for histone modifications and architectural proteins (CTCF, cohesin, condensin, HP1, Polycomb); ATAC-seq/DNase-seq for chromatin accessibility; RNA-seq for gene expression; and high-quality reference genomes with annotations. We will establish rigorous quality control criteria including sequencing depth thresholds (>100M read pairs for Hi-C), mapping quality metrics, and biological replicate requirements. All raw data will be reprocessed through standardized pipelines to eliminate technical batch effects: Hi-C data processed with HiC-Pro and Cooler for contact matrix generation; ChIP-seq analyzed with standard peak calling pipelines (MACS2, HOMER); ATAC-seq processed for accessibility peaks; RNA-seq quantified with Salmon/RSEM. Standardized outputs will be stored in common formats (cool/mcool for Hi-C, bigWig for coverage, BED for features) with comprehensive metadata following FAIR principles.\n\nPhase 2: Comparative Chromatin Architecture Analysis (Months 7-15). We will develop and apply novel computational frameworks for cross-species comparison of chromatin features. For 3D organization, we will: identify TADs using multiple algorithms (Arrowhead, TopDom, HiCExplorer) to assess robustness; call A/B compartments through eigenvector decomposition; detect chromatin loops using HiCCUPS and FitHiC; quantify organizational metrics including insulation scores, directionality indices, and contact enrichment patterns. Critically, we will develop phylogenetically-aware comparison methods that account for evolutionary distance and technical variation. This includes: normalization procedures adjusting for genome size and sequencing depth; alignment of syntenic regions using whole-genome alignments and orthology information from Ensembl Compara and OrthoFinder; statistical frameworks for testing conservation using phylogenetic generalized least squares and phylogenetic ANOVA; and machine learning approaches (random forests, deep learning) to identify organizational features predictive of phylogenetic position or genomic properties. For each species, we will generate comprehensive organizational profiles including TAD size distributions, compartment strengths, loop frequencies, and boundary characteristics.\n\nPhase 3: Architectural Protein Evolution and Binding Site Analysis (Months 10-20). We will conduct systematic evolutionary analyses of proteins implicated in chromatin organization. Using proteomes from all species in our dataset, we will: identify orthologs of known architectural proteins through reciprocal BLAST, HMMer searches, and phylogenetic tree construction; perform comprehensive phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to establish evolutionary relationships and identify gene duplications, losses, and innovations; analyze domain architectures to identify functional conservation and divergence; correlate protein presence/absence with organizational features using phylogenetic comparative methods. For binding site analysis, we will: integrate available ChIP-seq data to identify binding locations of architectural proteins; perform de novo motif discovery using MEME, HOMER, and deep learning approaches; map motifs to syntenic regions across species to assess conservation; correlate motif presence with organizational features like TAD boundaries and loop anchors; use machine learning to predict boundary positions from sequence features. This phase will produce comprehensive catalogs of architectural proteins across eukaryotes and their associated binding preferences.\n\nPhase 4: Evolutionary Constraint and Innovation Analysis (Months 16-28). We will integrate organizational data with genomic features and life history traits to identify evolutionary forces shaping chromatin architecture. Analyses include: quantifying correlations between organizational metrics and genome properties (size, GC content, gene density, repeat content) using phylogenetic comparative methods; testing associations between organizational complexity and life history traits (developmental complexity, cell-type diversity, environmental variability) through phylogenetic regression; identifying lineage-specific innovations through ancestral state reconstruction and phylogenetic comparative methods; detecting convergent evolution of organizational features in independent lineages; analyzing organizational changes associated with major evolutionary transitions through detailed case studies. We will employ sophisticated statistical approaches including phylogenetic independent contrasts, phylogenetic generalized least squares, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to account for phylogenetic non-independence and test alternative evolutionary hypotheses.\n\nPhase 5: Integration, Validation, and Resource Development (Months 24-36). Final phases focus on synthesis and resource creation. We will: integrate findings across analyses to identify universal principles and lineage-specific features; validate predictions through comparison with experimental literature and analysis of additional species not in the training set; develop user-friendly computational tools for cross-species chromatin comparison packaged as R/Python libraries and web interfaces; create a comprehensive Chromatin Architecture Atlas database with interactive visualization tools; curate datasets of orthologous regulatory elements and architectural protein binding sites; develop training materials including tutorials, workshops, and online courses. All code will be version-controlled on GitHub, documented, and released under open-source licenses. Data will be deposited in appropriate repositories with comprehensive metadata.\n\nTimeline Milestones: Month 6 - Complete data acquisition and standardization; Month 12 - Complete initial comparative analyses for 30 species; Month 18 - Complete architectural protein phylogenetic analyses; Month 24 - Complete evolutionary constraint analyses; Month 30 - Complete Chromatin Architecture Atlas beta version; Month 36 - Final publications, tool releases, and training program completion.

We will develop and release open-source computational tools specifically designed for cross-species chromatin comparison, including methods for synteny-aware feature alignment, phylogenetically-informed statistical testing, and organizational metric quantification. These tools will be packaged as user-friendly R/Python libraries with comprehensive documentation, enabling researchers without specialized computational expertise to perform comparative analyses. Curated datasets of orthologous regulatory elements and architectural protein binding sites across species will facilitate functional studies and provide training data for machine learning approaches. All analysis workflows will be documented as reproducible pipelines using workflow management systems (Snakemake, Nextflow) and containerized for portability.\n\nBroader Scientific Impact: This work will impact multiple research communities beyond chromatin biology.

We will develop online tutorials and courses covering data acquisition, quality control, comparative analysis, and phylogenetic methods, reaching hundreds of researchers globally. Trainees will gain expertise spanning chromatin biology, evolutionary genomics, and computational biology—interdisciplinary skills increasingly essential for modern biological research. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups and diverse institutional settings.\n\nDissemination and Publication Strategy: Findings will be disseminated through multiple high-impact publications including: a flagship paper presenting the Chromatin Architecture Atlas and major evolutionary findings; focused papers on architectural protein evolution, evolutionary constraints, and lineage-specific innovations; methods papers describing computational tools and comparative frameworks; and perspective pieces synthesizing implications for chromatin biology, evolution, and human disease. We will target journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Nature Genetics, Genome Research, and Molecular Biology and Evolution to reach diverse audiences.

The Chromatin Architecture Atlas will be maintained and expanded as new datasets become available, with mechanisms for community contributions. Computational tools will be maintained as open-source projects with active developer communities. The comparative frameworks established here will enable future studies addressing additional questions about chromatin evolution and function. We will pursue additional funding to expand taxonomic sampling, integrate emerging data types (single-cell Hi-C, multi-way chromatin contacts), and extend analyses to additional cellular and molecular features. Collaborations established through this project will continue generating insights and training opportunities. Ultimately, this work will establish comparative and evolutionary approaches as standard practice in chromatin biology, ensuring that discoveries are interpreted within proper evolutionary context and that the full diversity of eukaryotic solutions to organizational challenges informs our understanding of genome function.",

        "background_and_significance": "Temporal organization is fundamental to cellular function, yet our understanding of how cells coordinate multiple timing systems remains fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. Cells operate numerous molecular oscillators simultaneously: circadian clocks that align physiology with day-night cycles, cell cycle machinery that ensures proper division timing, metabolic rhythms that optimize energy utilization, and developmental timers that control differentiation. Each system has been extensively studied in isolation, generating vast repositories of time-series data across transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic platforms. However, the critical question of how these oscillatory networks interact, influence each other, and maintain coherent temporal organization across biological scales remains one of the most significant unsolved puzzles in molecular and cellular biology.\n\nCircadian biology has revealed that approximately 40-50% of mammalian transcripts exhibit daily oscillations, controlled by core clock genes including CLOCK, BMAL1, PER, and CRY families. These transcriptional-translational feedback loops generate ~24-hour rhythms that regulate diverse cellular processes. Simultaneously, cell cycle research has identified oscillatory expression of cyclins, CDKs, and checkpoint regulators that drive progression through G1, S, G2, and M phases. Metabolic studies have uncovered rhythms in NAD+/NADH ratios, ATP levels, and metabolite concentrations that oscillate with feeding-fasting cycles. Recent single-cell studies have revealed substantial heterogeneity in oscillatory dynamics, with individual cells showing variable periods, phases, and amplitudes even within synchronized populations.\n\nDespite these advances, fundamental gaps persist. First, we lack comprehensive understanding of coupling mechanisms between different oscillatory systems. Evidence suggests bidirectional interactions—circadian clocks gate cell cycle progression, metabolic state affects clock function, and cell cycle phase influences circadian amplitude—but the molecular mechanisms mediating these interactions remain unclear. Second, the hierarchical organization of cellular timekeeping is poorly defined. Do certain oscillators serve as master pacemakers, or does temporal coordination emerge from distributed interactions? Third, we do not understand how cells maintain temporal coherence across molecular layers (transcription, translation, metabolism) or how perturbations propagate through coupled oscillator networks.\n\nThese knowledge gaps have significant implications. Disrupted circadian rhythms are associated with cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. Cell cycle dysregulation drives oncogenesis. Understanding temporal coordination could reveal why shift work increases cancer risk, how chronotherapy can optimize drug timing, and why certain tissues are more vulnerable to circadian disruption. Moreover, synthetic biology efforts to engineer cellular timers require understanding natural temporal coordination principles.\n\nThe time is uniquely opportune for this synthesis project. First, unprecedented volumes of time-series omics data now exist in public repositories including CircaDB (circadian transcriptomics across tissues and conditions), Cyclebase (cell cycle expression data), MetabolomicsWorkbench (temporal metabolomics), and GEO/ArrayExpress (thousands of time-series experiments). Second, single-cell technologies have generated temporal datasets revealing cell-to-cell variability in oscillatory dynamics. Third, mathematical frameworks for analyzing coupled oscillators have matured, including phase response curve analysis, Kuramoto models, and information-theoretic approaches. Fourth, computational power and machine learning methods now enable integration of heterogeneous datasets at unprecedented scale.\n\nCritically, addressing these questions requires capabilities beyond any single laboratory. It demands integration of datasets generated using different technologies (microarrays, RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics), across different model systems (mammals, flies, fungi, cyanobacteria), and spanning different biological contexts (tissues, cell lines, developmental stages). It requires expertise in circadian biology, cell cycle regulation, metabolism, systems biology, applied mathematics, and bioinformatics—perspectives rarely combined in individual research groups. The synthesis approach is essential because temporal coordination is an emergent property that cannot be understood by studying individual oscillators in isolation. This project will catalyze a transdisciplinary community to tackle this fundamental question, generating resources and frameworks that will transform our understanding of cellular timekeeping and enable new therapeutic approaches for temporal disorders.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that collectively aim to construct a unified framework of cellular timekeeping:\n\nResearch Question 1: What are the molecular mechanisms coupling different oscillatory systems (circadian, cell cycle, metabolic) within cells? We hypothesize that coupling occurs through three primary mechanisms: (1) shared regulatory molecules that participate in multiple oscillatory networks (e.g., NAD+ affecting both circadian SIRT1 activity and metabolic state), (2) transcriptional regulation where one oscillator controls expression of components in another system (e.g., circadian regulation of cell cycle genes), and (3) post-translational modifications that transmit timing information between systems (e.g., metabolic state affecting protein stability). We predict that integrating time-series transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data will reveal molecules exhibiting multiple periodicities, indicating participation in multiple oscillatory networks. We will test this by identifying genes/proteins/metabolites with significant oscillatory components at circadian (~24h), cell cycle (variable), and ultradian (<24h) periods, then mapping their regulatory interactions. We expect to find hub molecules that serve as temporal coordinators, and predict these will be enriched for post-translational modifiers, metabolic enzymes, and signaling molecules.\n\nResearch Question 2: What is the hierarchical organization of cellular oscillatory networks, and do master pacemakers exist? We hypothesize that cellular timekeeping exhibits a hierarchical structure where circadian clocks serve as dominant pacemakers that entrain other oscillators, but that this hierarchy is context-dependent and can be overridden by strong metabolic or proliferative signals. We predict that phase relationships between oscillators will show consistent patterns across cell types and conditions, with circadian rhythms showing greatest phase stability and metabolic rhythms showing greatest phase plasticity. To test this, we will apply Granger causality analysis and transfer entropy methods to time-series data to infer directional influences between oscillatory systems. We will analyze how phase relationships change under perturbations (clock gene knockouts, metabolic stress, cell cycle arrest) to determine which oscillators are most resistant to disruption. We expect to find that hierarchy is tissue-specific, with circadian dominance in liver and SCN, but cell cycle dominance in rapidly proliferating tissues.\n\nResearch Question 3: How do cells maintain temporal coherence across molecular layers (transcription, translation, post-translation, metabolism), and what mechanisms buffer against desynchronization? We hypothesize that temporal coherence is maintained through feedforward and feedback loops that align different molecular layers, and that specific buffering mechanisms (e.g., protein stability control, metabolite buffering) prevent phase drift. We predict that phase relationships between transcript and protein oscillations will be non-uniform, with some genes showing tight coupling (short protein half-lives) and others showing phase delays (long half-lives, regulated translation). We will test this by integrating matched transcriptomic and proteomic time-series datasets to calculate phase differences and identify post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We expect to find that core clock components show tight transcript-protein coupling, while output genes show more variable relationships. We predict that metabolic oscillations will show phase advances relative to transcriptional rhythms, reflecting their role as both inputs and outputs of cellular clocks.\n\nResearch Question 4: How do perturbations propagate through coupled oscillator networks, and what network properties confer resilience or vulnerability? We hypothesize that oscillator networks exhibit small-world properties where perturbations to hub nodes propagate broadly while perturbations to peripheral nodes remain localized. We predict that genetic perturbations (knockouts) will show different propagation patterns than environmental perturbations (temperature, nutrients), with genetic perturbations causing sustained phase shifts and environmental perturbations causing transient amplitude changes. To test this, we will analyze time-series datasets from perturbation experiments (clock gene knockouts, cell cycle inhibitors, metabolic stress) and compare oscillatory dynamics to control conditions. We will construct network models and simulate perturbations to predict vulnerable nodes. We expect to find that metabolic oscillators are most sensitive to environmental perturbations while circadian oscillators are most sensitive to genetic perturbations.\n\nExpected Outcomes: Testing these hypotheses will yield: (1) a catalog of coupling molecules and mechanisms linking different oscillatory systems, (2) hierarchical network models defining temporal organization in different cell types and conditions, (3) quantitative phase relationships between molecular layers revealing coordination mechanisms, (4) perturbation response maps identifying vulnerable and resilient network components, and (5) predictive models enabling simulation of temporal dynamics under novel conditions. These outcomes will be validated through comparison with held-out datasets and through consistency across independent studies and model systems. Success will be measured by our ability to predict oscillatory behavior in new contexts and to identify previously unknown coupling mechanisms that can be experimentally validated by the broader community.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our synthesis approach integrates four complementary methodological strategies: comprehensive data aggregation and harmonization, multi-scale oscillatory analysis, network inference and modeling, and perturbation analysis. This 36-month project is organized into five phases with specific milestones.\n\nPhase 1 (Months 1-6): Data Identification, Acquisition, and Harmonization. We will systematically identify and acquire time-series datasets from multiple public repositories. Primary sources include: (1) CircaDB (>100 circadian transcriptomic datasets across tissues and organisms), (2) Cyclebase (cell cycle expression data from yeast, human, and other organisms), (3) Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress (time-series RNA-seq and microarray data), (4) PRIDE and ProteomeXchange (temporal proteomics), (5) MetabolomicsWorkbench (metabolite time-series), (6) Single-cell databases including CellxGene and SCPortalen (temporal single-cell RNA-seq). We will focus on datasets with: ≥12 time points per cycle, ≥2 complete cycles, biological replicates, and available metadata. Initial focus will be on mammalian systems (mouse, human) with expansion to Drosophila, yeast, and cyanobacteria for comparative analysis. Data harmonization will address technical heterogeneity through: batch effect correction using ComBat-seq and Harmony, normalization using TMM or DESeq2 for RNA-seq, and standardization of time representations (Zeitgeber time, circadian time, cell cycle phase). We will construct a unified data warehouse with standardized metadata following MINSEQE and MIAME standards. Milestone: Harmonized database containing ≥200 time-series datasets spanning transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.\n\nPhase 2 (Months 7-15): Oscillatory Pattern Detection and Characterization. We will apply multiple complementary algorithms to detect and characterize oscillations: (1) JTK_CYCLE and RAIN for circadian rhythm detection, (2) ARSER for identifying multiple periodicities, (3) Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data, (4) empirical mode decomposition for non-stationary oscillations, (5) wavelet analysis for time-frequency characterization, and (6) Bayesian methods (CYCLOPS) for single-cell oscillation detection. For each oscillatory component, we will extract: period, phase, amplitude, waveform shape, and statistical significance. We will develop a consensus approach requiring detection by ≥2 methods to minimize false positives. Single-cell analysis will characterize cell-to-cell variability in oscillatory parameters using circular statistics and phase coherence metrics. We will classify oscillatory patterns into categories: circadian (~24h), ultradian (<20h), infradian (>28h), and cell cycle-associated. Cross-platform integration will identify molecules oscillating at multiple levels (transcript, protein, metabolite). Milestone: Comprehensive oscillatory atlas cataloging >20,000 oscillating genes/proteins/metabolites with characterized temporal parameters.\n\nPhase 3 (Months 10-24): Coupling Mechanism Identification and Network Inference. We will identify coupling between oscillatory systems through multiple approaches: (1) Phase relationship analysis using circular correlation to identify consistent phase differences between oscillators, (2) Granger causality testing to infer directional influences, (3) Transfer entropy to quantify information flow between oscillatory systems, (4) Dynamic time warping to align and compare oscillatory patterns, (5) Partial correlation networks controlling for indirect effects. We will construct multi-layer temporal networks where nodes represent oscillating molecules and edges represent temporal relationships (correlation, causality, regulatory interactions). Network layers will represent different molecular types (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) and different oscillatory systems (circadian, cell cycle, metabolic). We will integrate known regulatory interactions from databases (STRING, KEGG, Reactome) to distinguish direct from indirect relationships. Hub analysis will identify molecules participating in multiple oscillatory networks. Community detection algorithms (Louvain, Infomap) will identify temporal modules. We will develop coupled oscillator models using: (1) Kuramoto models for phase synchronization, (2) delay differential equations for transcriptional feedback loops, (3) stochastic models for single-cell variability, and (4) machine learning approaches (recurrent neural networks, reservoir computing) for complex dynamics. Model parameters will be fit to empirical data using Bayesian inference and validated through cross-validation. Milestone: Multi-layer temporal network models for ≥5 cell types with validated predictive accuracy.\n\nPhase 4 (Months 16-30): Perturbation Analysis and Resilience Assessment. We will analyze time-series datasets from perturbation experiments including: genetic perturbations (clock gene knockouts, cell cycle mutants), pharmacological perturbations (period-altering compounds, cell cycle inhibitors), and environmental perturbations (temperature shifts, nutrient changes, light schedules). For each perturbation, we will quantify: changes in period, phase, and amplitude for each oscillator; propagation of effects through the network; recovery dynamics; and compensatory responses. We will apply dynamical systems analysis to characterize: bifurcations (qualitative changes in dynamics), basin of attraction (resilience to perturbations), and critical transitions. Network controllability analysis will identify driver nodes whose perturbation has maximal impact. We will simulate perturbations in our mathematical models and compare predictions to empirical observations, iteratively refining models. Milestone: Perturbation response atlas and validated predictive models of network resilience.\n\nPhase 5 (Months 24-36): Tool Development, Integration, and Dissemination. We will develop open-source computational tools including: (1) TemporalIntegrator: R/Python package for multi-omics time-series integration, (2) OscillatorNet: network inference and visualization platform, (3) CoupledClockSim: simulation environment for coupled oscillator models, (4) PhaseAnalyzer: tools for phase relationship analysis.

        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This synthesis project will generate transformative outcomes across multiple dimensions, fundamentally advancing molecular and cellular biology while establishing new paradigms for temporal systems analysis.\n\nScientific Outcomes: The primary deliverable is a Temporal Coordination Atlas—a comprehensive, publicly accessible resource cataloging oscillatory dynamics across molecular layers, cell types, and organisms. This atlas will include: (1) quantitative parameters (period, phase, amplitude, waveform) for >20,000 oscillating genes, proteins, and metabolites; (2) multi-layer temporal networks mapping coupling relationships between circadian, cell cycle, and metabolic oscillators; (3) hierarchical organization maps defining temporal control architecture in different cellular contexts; (4) phase relationship databases quantifying coordination between molecular layers; and (5) perturbation response profiles characterizing network resilience and vulnerability. This resource will enable researchers to query temporal dynamics of any gene/protein of interest, identify potential coupling mechanisms, and predict effects of perturbations—capabilities currently unavailable in any existing database.\n\nThe project will resolve long-standing questions about cellular timekeeping. We will definitively characterize coupling mechanisms between major oscillatory systems, revealing whether coordination occurs primarily through transcriptional regulation, shared metabolites, or post-translational modifications. We will establish whether cellular timekeeping follows a hierarchical master-slave organization or emerges from distributed interactions. We will quantify how temporal information flows between molecular layers and identify buffering mechanisms that maintain coherence. These insights will transform understanding of how cells orchestrate complex time-dependent processes from cell division to metabolism to stress responses.\n\nMethodological Innovations: We will develop and validate novel analytical approaches for temporal systems biology. Our coupled oscillator modeling framework will provide generalizable methods for analyzing interacting rhythmic processes in any biological context. Signal processing techniques adapted from engineering will enable robust detection of multiple periodicities in noisy biological data. Network inference methods will distinguish direct coupling from indirect correlations in temporal data. These methodological advances will be packaged as open-source software tools with comprehensive documentation, enabling widespread adoption. The standardized workflows for multi-omics time-series integration will establish best practices for the field, addressing current lack of consensus on analytical approaches.\n\nBroader Impacts: Understanding temporal coordination has profound implications for human health. Disrupted circadian rhythms are implicated in cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. Our identification of coupling mechanisms and vulnerable network nodes will reveal new therapeutic targets. The atlas will enable chronotherapy optimization—timing drug administration to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity based on temporal coordination principles. For cancer, understanding circadian-cell cycle coupling will explain why circadian disruption increases cancer risk and identify strategies to exploit temporal vulnerabilities in tumor cells. For metabolic disorders, characterizing circadian-metabolic coupling will inform timing of meals and medications. The perturbation response maps will predict individual variability in circadian disruption susceptibility, enabling personalized interventions.\n\nThe project will catalyze new interdisciplinary collaborations. By bringing together chronobiologists, cell cycle biologists, metabolic researchers, systems biologists, and mathematicians, we will break down traditional disciplinary silos. The working group will establish a sustained community of practice that continues beyond the funding period. We anticipate the synthesis will identify unexpected connections that spawn new experimental research programs. The models and predictions will generate testable hypotheses for experimental validation, creating a virtuous cycle between synthesis and experimentation.\n\nTraining and Workforce Development: The project will train the next generation of data-savvy biologists through multiple mechanisms. Graduate students and postdocs will be embedded in the working group, gaining hands-on experience with data integration, computational modeling, and collaborative science.

These materials will be disseminated through workshops, online tutorials, and a dedicated training portal. We will mentor early-career researchers in open science practices, collaborative research, and interdisciplinary communication. The project will particularly recruit trainees from underrepresented groups through partnerships with minority-serving institutions.\n\nDissemination and Sustainability: Results will be disseminated through multiple channels. We will publish high-impact papers in journals spanning chronobiology (e.g., Cell Metabolism), cell biology (e.g., Molecular Cell), and systems biology (e.g., Cell Systems). All publications will be open access. The Temporal Coordination Atlas will be hosted on a dedicated web portal with interactive visualization tools, maintained through institutional support beyond the project period. All data, code, and workflows will be deposited in appropriate repositories (GitHub, Zenodo, Dryad) with DOIs for citability. We will present findings at major conferences (Society for Research on Biological Rhythms, American Society for Cell Biology, ISMB) and organize symposia to engage the community. Social media and press releases will communicate findings to broader audiences.\n\nLong-term Vision: This project establishes temporal coordination as a central organizing principle in cell biology, comparable to how network biology transformed understanding of cellular regulation. The resources and frameworks developed will enable systems-level understanding of cellular timekeeping for decades to come. We envision the atlas becoming a standard reference resource, analogous to how gene expression atlases transformed developmental biology. The synthesis approach will serve as a model for addressing other emergent phenomena in molecular and cellular biology, demonstrating the power of integrating diverse datasets to answer fundamental questions beyond the reach of individual laboratories.",

        "background_and_significance": "Protein folding is fundamental to cellular function, yet our understanding of how proteins achieve their native conformations within the complex cellular environment remains incomplete. While decades of in vitro biochemistry have elucidated basic folding principles, the cellular context introduces layers of complexity that dramatically alter folding outcomes. Molecular crowding, with macromolecule concentrations reaching 300-400 g/L in cells, fundamentally changes protein stability and aggregation propensities. The cellular proteostasis network—comprising molecular chaperones, folding catalysts, and quality control machinery—actively manages the folding landscape for thousands of proteins simultaneously. Understanding this system is critical for addressing protein misfolding diseases, optimizing biotechnology applications, and comprehending cellular stress responses.\n\nRecent technological advances have generated unprecedented datasets relevant to cellular proteostasis. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics now routinely quantifies protein abundance, turnover rates, and post-translational modifications across thousands of proteins. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) provide proteome-wide measurements of protein stability and conformational states in living cells. Chaperone interaction networks have been mapped through affinity purification and proximity labeling approaches. AlphaFold2 and related tools now provide structural predictions for entire proteomes. Aggregation-prone regions have been catalogued through experimental screens and computational predictions. Stress response datasets document proteome remodeling under heat shock, oxidative stress, and disease conditions. Despite this wealth of data, these resources remain siloed in separate repositories, analyzed by distinct research communities, and interpreted through discipline-specific frameworks.\n\nCurrent understanding of cellular proteostasis suffers from critical gaps. First, we lack comprehensive knowledge of which proteins require chaperone assistance for folding versus those that fold spontaneously in cells. While estimates suggest 10-30% of proteins interact with major chaperones, the determinants of chaperone dependence remain poorly defined. Second, the evolutionary principles governing proteostasis network architecture across organisms are unclear. Why do some organisms invest heavily in specific chaperone families while others rely on alternative strategies? Third, the mechanisms determining why specific proteins aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS remain incompletely understood, despite knowing disease-associated proteins. Fourth, we cannot reliably predict which proteins will misfold under specific stress conditions or in different cell types, limiting our ability to anticipate proteostasis collapse.\n\nSeveral landmark studies have highlighted the importance of integrative approaches. Hartl and colleagues demonstrated that chaperone networks function as interconnected systems rather than independent pathways. Balch's proteostasis framework emphasized that folding outcomes depend on the balance between protein folding load and cellular capacity. Recent work by Hipp et al. showed that metastable proteins—those near the threshold of aggregation—are particularly vulnerable to stress and aging. Thermal proteome profiling studies by Savitski and colleagues revealed that protein stability varies dramatically across cell types and conditions. However, these insights have not been systematically integrated across the full proteome and multiple organisms.\n\nThis synthesis project is timely for several reasons. First, the requisite data now exists in public repositories but requires expert integration. ProteomeXchange contains over 20,000 datasets spanning diverse organisms and conditions. Aggregation databases like AmyPro and WALTZ catalogue experimentally validated aggregation-prone sequences. Chaperone interaction data from BioGRID and IntAct provide network context. AlphaFold structures cover model organism proteomes. Second, computational infrastructure and machine learning approaches have matured sufficiently to handle proteome-scale integration. Third, the urgency of understanding protein misfolding diseases has intensified with aging populations and limited therapeutic options. Fourth, training the next generation of researchers in integrative, data-driven approaches is essential as biology becomes increasingly computational.\n\nThe proposed synthesis addresses fundamental questions that cannot be answered by individual labs working with single datasets or model systems. It requires expertise spanning protein biochemistry, structural biology, cell biology, biophysics, computational biology, and evolutionary biology. The scale of data integration—spanning millions of measurements across thousands of proteins and multiple organisms—necessitates collaborative infrastructure and standardized analytical frameworks. By bringing together diverse expertise and synthesizing fragmented knowledge, this project will transform our understanding of how cells maintain proteome integrity and provide actionable insights for addressing protein misfolding diseases.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This synthesis project addresses four interconnected research questions that require integration of diverse datasets and multidisciplinary expertise:\n\nResearch Question 1: What molecular features determine chaperone dependence for protein folding in cellular environments? We hypothesize that chaperone dependence is determined by a combination of intrinsic protein properties (structural complexity, hydrophobic exposure, domain architecture) and cellular context (expression level, synthesis rate, localization). Specifically, we predict that: (H1a) proteins with high contact order, multiple domains, and extensive buried hydrophobic surface area will show greater chaperone dependence; (H1b) highly abundant proteins will have evolved reduced chaperone dependence to minimize cellular burden; (H1c) rapidly synthesized proteins will require more chaperone assistance due to co-translational folding challenges. We will test these hypotheses by integrating chaperone interaction data from affinity purification-mass spectrometry studies with AlphaFold structural predictions, ribosome profiling data on synthesis rates, and proteomics measurements of abundance. Machine learning models will identify features predictive of chaperone dependence, validated against independent experimental datasets. Expected outcomes include a quantitative framework for predicting chaperone requirements and identification of protein classes most vulnerable to chaperone network perturbations.\n\nResearch Question 2: How do proteostasis network architectures evolve across organisms, and what principles govern their optimization? We hypothesize that proteostasis networks co-evolve with proteome composition, environmental challenges, and life history strategies. Specifically: (H2a) organisms with larger proteomes and greater protein complexity will invest more heavily in chaperone networks; (H2b) thermophilic organisms will show enhanced investment in disaggregases and holdase chaperones; (H2c) long-lived organisms will have more robust quality control systems to maintain proteome integrity over extended lifespans. We will test these hypotheses through comparative analysis of chaperone gene families, expression levels, and interaction networks across bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals, integrated with proteome complexity metrics, environmental data, and longevity measurements. Phylogenetic comparative methods will identify evolutionary correlations while controlling for phylogenetic relationships. Expected outcomes include evolutionary principles governing proteostasis network design and identification of lineage-specific innovations.\n\nResearch Question 3: Why do specific proteins aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases, and can we predict disease-vulnerable proteins? We hypothesize that disease-associated aggregation results from proteins operating near the threshold of cellular folding capacity, where modest perturbations tip the balance toward misfolding. Specifically: (H3a) disease-aggregating proteins will show marginal stability in thermal proteome profiling data; (H3b) these proteins will have high predicted aggregation propensity in specific regions but normally be protected by chaperones or cellular conditions; (H3c) disease-associated mutations will destabilize proteins beyond the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network. We will test these hypotheses by integrating disease mutation databases (ClinVar, OMIM), aggregation propensity predictions, thermal stability measurements, chaperone interaction data, and tissue-specific expression patterns. Comparative analysis of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's disease will identify common vulnerability signatures. Expected outcomes include predictive models for disease-associated aggregation and identification of previously unrecognized at-risk proteins.\n\nResearch Question 4: How does proteostasis capacity vary across cell types, developmental stages, and stress conditions, and what determines the threshold for proteostasis collapse? We hypothesize that proteostasis capacity is dynamically regulated and varies systematically with cellular state. Specifically: (H4a) post-mitotic cells (neurons, cardiomyocytes) will show reduced proteostasis capacity with age; (H4b) cells with high secretory burden will invest disproportionately in ER-localized chaperones; (H4c) proteostasis collapse occurs when the aggregate folding demand exceeds chaperone capacity by a threshold factor. We will test these hypotheses by integrating cell-type-specific proteomics data, developmental time-course datasets, stress response measurements, and aging studies across model organisms. Quantitative modeling will define proteostasis capacity as the ratio of chaperone availability to client protein folding demand. Expected outcomes include a cellular proteostasis atlas mapping capacity across cell types and conditions, and quantitative thresholds predicting collapse.\n\nCross-cutting validation approaches will ensure robustness. First, predictions will be validated against held-out experimental datasets not used in model training. Second, cross-organism validation will test whether principles identified in one species generalize to others. Third, we will identify discrepancies between predictions and observations as opportunities for biological discovery. Fourth, community feedback through workshops and preprint sharing will refine hypotheses iteratively.\n\nExpected deliverables include: (1) quantitative models predicting chaperone dependence from sequence and structure; (2) evolutionary principles governing proteostasis network architecture; (3) disease-vulnerability scores for all human proteins; (4) cell-type and condition-specific proteostasis capacity maps; (5) standardized datasets integrating all analyzed data; (6) open-source software tools for proteostasis analysis; (7) training materials for interdisciplinary proteostasis research. These outcomes will transform understanding of cellular protein folding and provide actionable insights for disease intervention.",

From BioGRID, IntAct, and published studies, we will compile chaperone-client interaction networks for Hsp70, Hsp90, chaperonins, and small heat shock proteins across organisms. From PDB and AlphaFold Database, we will obtain structural information for all proteins in target organisms (E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, H. sapiens). From aggregation databases (AmyPro, WALTZ, Aggrescan), we will extract experimentally validated aggregation-prone regions. From ClinVar and OMIM, we will compile disease-associated mutations. From Gene Expression Omnibus, we will extract stress response transcriptomics and proteomics (heat shock, oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress). From ribosome profiling databases, we will obtain translation rates. A dedicated data management team will standardize identifiers, quality-filter datasets, and create a unified database with comprehensive metadata.\n\nAnalytical Pipeline Development (Months 4-12): We will develop standardized computational pipelines for data integration and analysis. Structural feature extraction will use AlphaFold predictions to calculate contact order, domain architecture, buried surface area, secondary structure content, and intrinsic disorder. Aggregation propensity will be computed using multiple algorithms (TANGO, Zyggregator, PASTA 2.0) and integrated through ensemble approaches. Chaperone dependence classification will employ machine learning (random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) trained on experimentally validated chaperone-client interactions, using structural features, abundance, synthesis rates, and localization as predictors. Cross-validation and independent test sets will assess model performance. Proteostasis capacity modeling will quantify the ratio of available chaperone binding sites to client protein folding demand, incorporating abundance, stoichiometry, and binding kinetics from literature. All pipelines will be implemented in Python and R, containerized with Docker, and version-controlled on GitHub.\n\nComparative Evolutionary Analysis (Months 6-18): We will analyze proteostasis network evolution across 100+ organisms spanning the tree of life. Chaperone gene families will be identified through orthology analysis (OrthoFinder) and quantified for gene number, expression level, and interaction network size. Proteome complexity metrics will include proteome size, average protein length, domain architecture complexity, and predicted aggregation propensity. Environmental data (optimal growth temperature, habitat) and life history traits (lifespan, reproductive strategy) will be compiled from databases and literature. Phylogenetic comparative methods (phylogenetic generalized least squares, phylogenetic independent contrasts) implemented in R packages (ape, phytools, caper) will test evolutionary correlations while controlling for shared ancestry. Ancestral state reconstruction will infer proteostasis network evolution along phylogenetic branches.\n\nDisease Protein Analysis (Months 12-24): We will conduct comprehensive analysis of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Disease-associated proteins and mutations will be mapped onto structural models to assess stability effects using FoldX and Rosetta. Thermal stability data from cellular TPP experiments will be compared between disease and control conditions. Chaperone interaction networks will be analyzed for disease proteins to identify protective interactions. Aggregation propensity predictions will be computed for wild-type and mutant sequences. Tissue-specific expression patterns will be integrated to understand cell-type vulnerability. Machine learning classifiers will be trained to distinguish disease-aggregating proteins from non-aggregating proteins matched for abundance and expression pattern. Feature importance analysis will identify key vulnerability determinants. Predictions will be validated against proteins recently implicated in disease through genetic studies.\n\nCell-Type and Condition-Specific Analysis (Months 18-30): We will construct a cellular proteostasis atlas mapping capacity across biological contexts. Cell-type-specific proteomics data will be compiled for 50+ human cell types, 20+ mouse tissues, and developmental time courses in model organisms. For each context, we will quantify: (1) chaperone expression levels and stoichiometry; (2) client protein abundance and predicted folding demand; (3) proteostasis capacity scores; (4) stress response dynamics. Clustering analysis will identify cell types with similar proteostasis profiles. Developmental trajectories will reveal how proteostasis capacity changes during differentiation and aging. Stress response data will define thresholds for proteostasis collapse under heat shock, oxidative stress, and proteotoxic conditions. Interactive visualization tools will enable exploration of the atlas.\n\nIntegration and Validation (Months 24-36): Final integration will synthesize all analyses into unified models and resources. Cross-validation will test predictions against independent datasets. Discrepancy analysis will identify cases where predictions fail, highlighting areas for biological investigation. Sensitivity analysis will assess robustness to data quality and parameter choices. Community workshops (Months 12, 24, 36) will gather feedback and refine approaches.

These resources will lower barriers to entry for researchers seeking to conduct synthesis research.\n\nBroader Impacts: This project addresses critical societal challenges related to aging and neurodegenerative disease. By identifying proteins vulnerable to misfolding and mapping proteostasis capacity across cell types, we will provide actionable targets for therapeutic development. Pharmaceutical companies can use vulnerability scores to prioritize drug targets and predict off-target aggregation risks for therapeutic proteins. Biotechnology applications will benefit from improved ability to engineer proteins that fold efficiently in production systems. Agricultural applications may emerge from understanding how plants maintain proteostasis under environmental stress.\n\nThe training program will prepare graduate students and postdocs for careers in data-intensive biology.

Interactive web portals will enable community exploration of results without computational expertise. We will organize three community workshops to gather feedback, demonstrate tools, and train users. Annual progress reports will be posted publicly. We will engage with disease advocacy organizations to communicate findings to patient communities.\n\nPublication Strategy: We anticipate 8-12 peer-reviewed publications spanning high-impact general journals (Nature, Science, Cell) for major integrative findings, specialized journals (Molecular Cell, Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Cell Reports) for focused analyses, and methods journals (Nature Methods, Bioinformatics) for computational tools. We will also publish data descriptor papers in Scientific Data to maximize dataset visibility and reuse.\n\nFollow-up Research: This project will catalyze numerous follow-up investigations. Predictions of vulnerable proteins will motivate experimental validation studies. Evolutionary insights will inspire comparative studies in non-model organisms. Disease vulnerability scores will guide clinical genetic studies and therapeutic development. The atlas will serve as a reference for interpreting future proteomics experiments. We will actively seek partnerships with experimental labs to validate predictions and with pharmaceutical companies to translate findings.\n\nLong-term Sustainability: Beyond the funding period, we will maintain the Cellular Proteostasis Atlas through integration with existing databases (UniProt, PDB, ProteomeXchange). We will seek additional funding for experimental validation and expansion to additional organisms and conditions. The trained cohort of researchers will form a community of practice continuing to advance integrative proteostasis research. By establishing standardized approaches and demonstrating the power of synthesis research, this project will inspire similar efforts addressing other fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biology.",

The project integrates datasets from thousands of experiments across multiple organisms and conditions—far beyond single-lab capabilities. Multiple postdocs with complementary expertise are essential for addressing diverse analytical challenges. Computational infrastructure costs reflect the data-intensive nature of proteome-scale analysis. Workshops and training programs are central to the community-building mission. All expenditures directly support synthesis research, collaborative team science, and workforce development aligned with program goals. The investment will yield transformative insights into cellular proteostasis while training researchers in integrative approaches and producing open resources benefiting the entire research community."
