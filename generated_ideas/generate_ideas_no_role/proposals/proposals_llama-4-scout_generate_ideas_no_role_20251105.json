        "background_and_significance": "The function of a protein is determined by its sequence and structure, which in turn dictate its role in various biological processes. Despite the exponential growth of protein sequence and structure data, the function of many proteins remains unknown or poorly understood. This knowledge gap significantly hampers our ability to understand cellular mechanisms, predict disease-causing mutations, and design novel therapeutics. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to predict protein function from sequence and structure data, offering a promising solution to this challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of machine learning models to predict protein function with high accuracy. However, these models are often limited by the quality and diversity of the training data, and the lack of comprehensive evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the interpretation of predicted protein functions remains a significant challenge, requiring the integration of additional data types and biological knowledge. This project aims to address these limitations by developing novel machine learning approaches that integrate multiple data types and leverage the strengths of different algorithms. Our approach will provide a comprehensive platform for protein function prediction, enabling researchers to identify potential functional motifs, predict protein function, and explore the relationships between sequence, structure, and function.",

We hypothesize that: 1) Machine learning models will outperform traditional methods for protein function prediction, particularly when trained on large-scale datasets that integrate multiple data types. 2) The integration of sequence, structure, and functional data will significantly improve protein function prediction accuracy. 3) The identified features and motifs will provide valuable insights into protein function and evolution. We will test these hypotheses by: 1) Developing and evaluating machine learning models using large-scale datasets of protein sequence, structure, and functional data. 2) Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms and data integration strategies. 3) Analyzing the predicted protein functions and identifying potential functional motifs using various bioinformatics tools.",

        "background_and_significance": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression and cellular processes, with their dysregulation implicated in various human diseases. Despite their importance, the functions of many ncRNAs remain unknown, and their role in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. The rapid growth of publicly available genomic and transcriptomic data provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate ncRNAs in human diseases. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these data necessitate a community-scale approach to integrate and analyze them effectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of ncRNA biology and their involvement in disease mechanisms is still lacking. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by leveraging publicly available data to identify novel ncRNAs associated with human diseases and elucidate their potential functional roles.
