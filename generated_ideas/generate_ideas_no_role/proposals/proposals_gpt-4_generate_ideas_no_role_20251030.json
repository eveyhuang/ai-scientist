By engineering viruses using synthetic biology, we can potentially enhance their efficiency and safety as gene delivery vectors. However, this requires a deep understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral infection, which can be obtained by synthesizing and analyzing existing data from diverse sources. This project aims to fill this gap by synthesizing existing molecular and cellular data to develop innovative strategies for engineering viruses for gene therapy.
