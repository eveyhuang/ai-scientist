      "original_abstract": "Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, is a fundamental biological process implicated in aging, cancer, and tissue repair. However, it is not a monolithic state; rather, it is a collection of heterogeneous phenotypes whose emergence is governed by a complex interplay between the initiating stressor, cell type, and tissue microenvironment. This working group will address a long-standing puzzle: what are the fundamental principles that determine the specific 'flavor' of senescence, particularly the composition of the pro-inflammatory Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)? We propose a community-scale synthesis project that integrates disparate, publicly available datasets to deconstruct the emergence of senescent heterogeneity. Our transdisciplinary team of cell biologists, bioinformaticians, systems biologists, and machine learning experts will collate and harmonize transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq), proteomic, and metabolomic data from hundreds of studies across diverse cell types, species, and senescence inducers (e.g., oncogenic, replicative, therapy-induced). By applying advanced network inference algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, we will build a multi-layered molecular atlas of senescence. This will allow us to move beyond cataloging differences to modeling how initial stress signals propagate through regulatory networks to establish stable, emergent senescent states. The project will develop a predictive model of SASP composition based on cellular context and stressor identity, identify core regulatory modules that act as master switches for different senescence programs, and create a publicly accessible, integrated data resource and analysis portal for the research community. This work will provide a systems-level understanding of a key biological process and has the potential to revolutionize the development of targeted senolytic therapies for a wide range of age-related diseases.",

        "background_and_significance": "Cellular senescence, first described as a limit to cellular proliferation in vitro, is now recognized as a fundamental biological process with profound, yet paradoxical, roles in vivo. This state of stable cell cycle arrest, governed primarily by the p53/p21 and p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathways, acts as a potent barrier to malignant transformation. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age is also a key driver of organismal aging and a contributor to a host of age-related pathologies, including cancer, fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. A central feature of most senescent cells is the acquisition of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a complex secretome comprising pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling proteases. The SASP is responsible for many of the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescence, mediating chronic inflammation, altering tissue structures, and influencing the behavior of neighboring cells. Yet, the SASP also has beneficial functions, such as signaling for immune-mediated clearance of senescent or pre-cancerous cells and promoting tissue repair.\n\nA critical turning point in the field has been the growing appreciation that senescence is not a single, uniform state. Landmark studies have demonstrated that the specific composition of the SASP, and the senescent phenotype more broadly, is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent. The nature of the initiating stressor—be it telomere attrition (replicative senescence), oncogene activation (OIS), DNA damage, or metabolic dysfunction—profoundly shapes the resulting phenotype. For instance, the SASP induced by oncogenic RAS differs significantly from that induced by DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Furthermore, the cell type of origin and its surrounding microenvironment impose additional layers of regulation. A senescent fibroblast secretes a different cocktail of factors than a senescent epithelial cell, even when triggered by the same stimulus. This heterogeneity is the central puzzle in senescence biology today. While we have a growing 'parts list' of SASP components and upstream signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB, C/EBPβ, GATA4), we lack a systems-level, mechanistic understanding of how these diverse inputs are integrated to produce a specific, stable, and emergent phenotypic output.\n\nThis gap in our knowledge represents a major barrier to therapeutic progress. The development of senolytics—drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells—is one of the most exciting frontiers in geroscience, with several compounds in clinical trials. However, a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to eliminating senescent cells may be suboptimal or even detrimental, as it fails to distinguish between cells with beneficial versus pathological functions. A more sophisticated strategy would be to modulate the SASP, selectively inhibiting its harmful components while preserving its beneficial ones. This requires a predictive understanding of what controls the SASP's composition, which is currently impossible due to the siloed nature of existing research. Individual studies typically focus on one cell type and one stressor, generating valuable but narrow datasets. The explosion of publicly available multi-omic data (transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic) from hundreds of such studies presents an unprecedented opportunity. However, integrating these disparate datasets, which use different platforms and protocols, is a massive undertaking beyond the scope of any single research lab. This project is therefore both important and timely. By convening a multidisciplinary working group to perform a community-scale synthesis of this data, we can finally deconstruct the complex logic of senescence heterogeneity and build the predictive models necessary to guide the next generation of senotherapeutic strategies.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This working group will address the fundamental question of how diverse senescent phenotypes emerge from the complex interplay of stress, cell type, and molecular context. We have formulated three specific, interrelated research questions, each with testable hypotheses, that will guide our data synthesis approach.\n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can we establish a comprehensive, multi-omic taxonomy of senescent states that moves beyond single-marker definitions to create a robust classification system based on integrated molecular signatures?**\nOur central hypothesis is that senescent cells do not exist on a simple continuum but rather occupy distinct, stable states in a high-dimensional molecular space. We will test two specific sub-hypotheses:\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Senescent states cluster primarily by the cell's lineage of origin and secondarily by the class of inducing stressor. We predict that the baseline epigenetic and transcriptional state of a progenitor cell acts as a primary constraint, defining a limited repertoire of possible senescent phenotypes it can adopt. The specific stressor then selects for or fine-tunes a particular state within that repertoire.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** These distinct senescent clusters are defined by unique combinations of active gene regulatory networks, chromatin states, and metabolic programs, not just by the expression of a few canonical markers like p16 or SA-β-gal. We predict our integrated analysis will reveal novel, subtype-specific markers that are more reliable classifiers than existing ones.\n*   **Testing and Deliverable:** We will test these hypotheses by applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to our integrated multi-omic dataset. The validity of the resulting clusters will be assessed by their stability across different algorithms and their association with metadata (cell type, stressor). The key deliverable will be a publicly accessible 'Senescence Atlas,' a foundational resource cataloging robustly defined senescent subtypes and their defining molecular features.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and master transcription factors (TFs) that orchestrate the establishment and maintenance of specific senescent phenotypes, particularly the diverse compositions of the SASP?**\nWe hypothesize that the vast heterogeneity of the SASP is controlled by a combinatorial logic involving a limited set of 'hub' TFs that integrate upstream signals and context-specific chromatin accessibility.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Beyond the well-established roles of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, we will identify context-specific master TFs that drive distinct modules of the SASP (e.g., a 'pro-fibrotic' module vs. an 'immune-chemoattractant' module). We predict that the identity of these TFs will be strongly dependent on cell lineage.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The epigenetic landscape (i.e., chromatin accessibility) acts as a critical 'gatekeeper' that determines the regulatory potential of these TFs. A TF may be highly expressed, but if its target gene promoters are inaccessible in a given cell type, it cannot execute its regulatory function. This TF-epigenome interplay is a key determinant of the final phenotype.\n*   **Testing and Deliverable:** We will use advanced network inference algorithms to reconstruct GRNs for each major senescent subtype identified in RQ1. These networks will be constrained by integrated ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data to increase their biological accuracy. We will validate predicted hub TFs by assessing the correlation between their activity and the expression of their predicted target genes across hundreds of samples. The deliverable will be a set of validated, context-specific GRNs that provide mechanistic blueprints for different senescent fates.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can we develop a quantitative, predictive model that accurately forecasts the SASP composition based on the identity of the stressor and the multi-omic state of the pre-senescent cell?**\nWe hypothesize that the determinants of the SASP are sufficiently encoded in the initial cellular state and the nature of the stress, and that this complex relationship can be learned by advanced machine learning models.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** A machine learning model trained on our integrated atlas can predict the expression levels of key SASP factors with significantly higher accuracy than a simple linear model, indicating the presence of complex, non-linear interactions between determinants.\n*   **Testing and Deliverable:** We will train and test various machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks) on a partitioned subset of our harmonized data. The model's inputs will be features representing cell type and stressor, and its outputs will be the expression levels of ~100 core SASP factors. Performance will be rigorously evaluated on a held-out test set. The final deliverable will be a validated, open-source computational tool that allows researchers to perform in silico experiments, predicting the SASP for novel combinations of cell types and stressors.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is designed as a multi-phase, collaborative effort that leverages the unique, transdisciplinary expertise of our working group. Our approach is grounded in open science principles, ensuring all methods, code, and data are transparent and reproducible.\n\n**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** Our team comprises experts in senescence cell biology (PI 1), bioinformatics and data harmonization (PI 2), systems biology and network inference (PI 3), and machine learning (PI 4). This structure is essential, as the project requires deep domain knowledge to guide data curation, sophisticated computational skills for data processing and modeling, and biological intuition for interpreting the results. The project will be managed through a central GitHub repository for code and analysis pipelines, a shared cloud-based data storage platform, and bi-weekly virtual meetings. Two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students will form the core research team, receiving direct mentorship from all PIs, thereby fostering the next generation of data-savvy biologists as per the research call's mission.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Harmonization, and Integration (Months 1-12)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on creating the integrated dataset. \n*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic, exhaustive search of public repositories, including NCBI GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress, ProteomeXchange, and Metabolomics Workbench. Our search will use a comprehensive set of keywords (e.g., 'cellular senescence', 'SASP', 'oncogene-induced senescence') to identify all relevant publicly available transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq for key histone marks and TFs), proteomic, and metabolomic datasets from human and mouse models. We anticipate identifying and curating over 500 distinct experimental series.\n*   **Metadata Standardization:** A rigorous curation process will capture essential metadata for each sample in a standardized format, including species, cell/tissue type, senescence inducer, time post-induction, and experimental protocol. This structured metadata is critical for all downstream analyses.\n*   **Unified Processing Pipelines:** To ensure comparability, all raw data will be reprocessed from scratch using a single set of best-practice pipelines. These pipelines will be containerized using Docker and managed with a workflow manager like Nextflow. For example, all RNA-seq data will be aligned to the same reference genome build (GRCh38/mm10) and quantified using Salmon. ATAC-seq data will be processed through a uniform pipeline for alignment, peak calling (MACS2), and signal normalization. This step is crucial for removing technical artifacts stemming from different processing methods in the original publications.\n*   **Batch Effect Correction and Integration:** The harmonized, gene-level count matrices and genomic signal tracks will be integrated. We will employ advanced batch correction algorithms, such as Harmony or ComBat-seq, which are designed to remove technical variability between studies while preserving the underlying biological heterogeneity, a key requirement for our study.\n\n**Phase 2: Constructing the Multi-Omic Senescence Atlas (RQ1) (Months 10-20)**\n*   **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:** Using the integrated transcriptomic data as a scaffold, we will apply non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (UMAP, t-SNE) to visualize the global structure of senescent states. We will then use graph-based clustering algorithms (e.g., Leiden) to partition the cells into distinct clusters, or 'subtypes'. The robustness of these clusters will be tested by consensus clustering and silhouette scoring.\n*   **Multi-Omic Characterization:** We will use tools like MOFA+ to integrate data layers, identifying latent factors that capture variability across transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and proteomics. Each subtype will be deeply characterized by identifying differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways (GSEA), active TF motifs (using the underlying ATAC-seq data), and distinct proteomic signatures.\n\n**Phase 3: Gene Regulatory Network Inference (RQ2) (Months 18-28)**\n*   **Network Reconstruction:** For each major subtype defined in Phase 2, we will reconstruct a context-specific GRN. We will use information-theoretic algorithms like ARACNE or regression-based methods like GENIE3, which infer TF-target relationships from expression data. \n*   **Network Refinement:** To improve accuracy, these inferred networks will be pruned and refined using prior biological knowledge. Specifically, we will retain only those regulatory edges where (a) the target gene's promoter is accessible in the corresponding ATAC-seq data and (b) the TF's binding motif is present. Where available, ChIP-seq data will be used for further validation. Network centrality analyses will then be used to identify the 'hub' TFs that are predicted to be the master regulators of each state.\n\n**Phase 4: Predictive Modeling of the SASP (RQ3) (Months 24-33)**\n*   **Model Building:** We will formulate the prediction of the SASP as a machine learning task. Input features will include one-hot encoded vectors for the stressor, and quantitative features derived from the baseline (non-senescent) state of the cell type (e.g., expression of key lineage TFs, baseline chromatin accessibility at SASP gene loci). The output will be a vector of normalized expression values for a curated set of ~100 core SASP factors. We will train and compare multiple models, including XGBoost and deep neural networks, using a rigorous cross-validation framework.\n*   **Model Validation and Interpretation:** The final model will be evaluated on a held-out test set of data not used during training or hyperparameter tuning. To understand the model's logic, we will employ interpretability techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each input feature to the prediction of each SASP factor's expression. This will reveal the key determinants of SASP composition.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   Year 1: Completion of data harmonization pipeline (M9); Release of first-generation transcriptomic Senescence Atlas (M12).\n*   Year 2: Integration of multi-omic data into a refined Atlas (M18); Completion of subtype-specific GRN reconstruction (M24).\n*   Year 3: Development and validation of the predictive SASP model (M30); Public launch of the web portal with all data and tools (M33); Submission of manuscripts and final report (M36).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will generate transformative outcomes that will reshape our understanding of cellular senescence and provide the community with powerful new resources, directly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS research call. The impact will span fundamental biology, translational medicine, and the training of a new generation of scientists.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field:**\nThe primary outcome of this work will be a paradigm shift from viewing senescence as a monolithic process to understanding it as a complex, emergent system with multiple distinct and predictable phenotypic outputs. \n1.  **The Senescence Atlas:** This will be the first-of-its-kind, comprehensive, multi-omic map of senescent cell states. By providing a robust, data-driven taxonomy, the Atlas will establish a common language and reference framework for the entire field. It will resolve long-standing debates about senescence markers and enable researchers to precisely classify the types of senescent cells in their own experimental systems. This resource moves beyond a simple catalog by defining states based on integrated molecular signatures, revealing the deep principles of their organization.\n2.  **Mechanistic Insights into Phenotypic Control:** Our inferred gene regulatory networks will provide concrete, testable hypotheses about the molecular machinery that governs senescent fate decisions. By identifying novel, context-specific master regulators and signaling hubs that control the SASP, we will open up entirely new avenues of investigation into the basic biology of senescence. This addresses a fundamental question in cellular biology: how do cells integrate diverse signals to produce a stable, complex phenotype?\n3.  **A Predictive Engine for Geroscience:** The machine learning model for predicting SASP composition represents a novel capability for the field. It will function as a powerful hypothesis-generation tool, allowing researchers to perform *in silico* experiments to predict the consequences of a given drug or genetic perturbation on the secretome of a specific cell type. This will accelerate research by helping to prioritize experiments and interpret complex results.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe impact of this project extends far beyond basic science. \n*   **Advancing Therapeutic Strategies:** Our findings have direct translational relevance for age-related diseases. Current senolytic therapies risk eliminating senescent cells with beneficial functions. Our work will enable a more nuanced 'senomorphic' or 'SASP-modulatory' approach. By identifying the specific regulators of pathological SASP components, our work will pinpoint novel drug targets for therapies that can reprogram a harmful, pro-inflammatory SASP into a benign or even beneficial one. The predictive model could be used to stratify patients for clinical trials or to design personalized senotherapeutic interventions.\n*   **An Enduring Community Resource:** A major deliverable is the creation of a public, interactive web portal. This portal will provide open access to all harmonized data, the Senescence Atlas, the inferred networks, and the predictive model. It will feature intuitive visualization and analysis tools, democratizing access to this complex synthesis project. This empowers researchers, including those at primarily undergraduate institutions or with limited computational resources, to query the data and explore their own hypotheses, thus catalyzing new research across the community.\n*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is an ideal training environment. Trainees will be immersed in a transdisciplinary, collaborative setting, gaining highly sought-after skills in big data analysis, cloud computing, network biology, and machine learning, applied to a critical biological problem. This directly addresses the call's objective to train the future data-savvy scientific workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science:**\nWe are fully committed to open science principles. All analysis scripts will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. All processed data and curated metadata will be deposited in a FAIR-compliant repository like Zenodo. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. We will present our work at national and international conferences and will host a final-year workshop to train the broader community on using our web portal and resources. This comprehensive dissemination strategy ensures that the project's outcomes will have a broad and lasting impact.",

        "background_and_significance": "The eukaryotic cell is a paragon of emergent complexity, achieving robust function through the precise spatiotemporal organization of its molecular components. For over a century, this organization was thought to be primarily mediated by lipid membranes that enclose distinct organelles. However, a recent paradigm shift has revealed a second, orthogonal mode of compartmentalization: the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs), or biomolecular condensates, through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This physical process, driven by multivalent, weak interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, allows cells to rapidly concentrate specific molecules into dynamic, liquid-like droplets such as the nucleolus, P-bodies, and stress granules. These condensates are not passive depots; they are active microreactors that regulate fundamental processes including transcription, RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and stress response. The molecular drivers of LLPS are increasingly understood to be encoded in the primary sequences of proteins and RNAs. Features such as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), low-complexity domains (LCDs), RNA-binding motifs, and specific patterns of charge and aromatic residues confer the multivalency required for phase separation. Seminal work by Brangwynne, Hyman, Rosen, and others has established the biophysical foundations of this process, and a suite of computational tools (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE, FuzDrop) and databases (e.g., PhaSepDB, LLPSDB) have been developed to predict the LLPS propensity of individual proteins. Despite this progress, the field faces critical knowledge gaps that prevent a systems-level understanding of cellular organization. The most significant limitation is the 'specificity problem': while we can often predict *if* a protein will phase separate, we cannot predict *which* of the dozens of distinct condensates it will preferentially partition into. The molecular 'grammar' or 'zip code' that dictates specific MLO composition remains an outstanding puzzle. A second major gap is the 'context-dependency problem'. Cellular condensates are not static entities; they assemble, dissolve, and change composition in response to developmental cues, cell cycle progression, and environmental stress. This dynamism is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) and changes in component concentrations, yet current predictive models are largely static and context-agnostic. Finally, the relevant data required to solve these problems is vast but severely fragmented. Information on protein sequences, structures, interaction partners, cellular localization, expression levels, and PTMs is scattered across dozens of public databases. No single research group possesses the expertise or resources to integrate and synthesize this heterogeneous, petabyte-scale data into a coherent predictive framework. This project is both important and timely because it addresses these fundamental gaps at a unique confluence of data availability and conceptual need. Understanding the grammar of MLO assembly is essential for a complete picture of cellular function. Furthermore, the dysregulation of LLPS is increasingly implicated in devastating human diseases, including neurodegeneration (e.g., the pathological solidification of FUS or TDP-43 condensates in ALS) and cancer (e.g., aberrant phase separation driven by oncogenic fusion proteins). A predictive framework for MLO composition would be transformative for generating mechanistic hypotheses in these disease contexts. The explosion of public omics data, coupled with advances in machine learning, provides an unprecedented opportunity to tackle this challenge through a large-scale data synthesis effort, moving beyond the capacity of any single lab to reveal the emergent principles governing life's internal architecture.",

Our work is organized around three central aims, each addressing a critical gap in the field through specific, testable hypotheses that leverage the synthesis of public data.\n\n**Aim 1: To establish a unified, multi-scale 'condensatome' atlas by integrating heterogeneous public data.**\nThis aim addresses the foundational need for a comprehensive, evidence-based catalog of MLO components, which currently does not exist. \n*   **Research Question 1.1:** What is the complete, high-confidence repertoire of proteins and RNAs that constitute the major MLOs (e.g., nucleolus, stress granules, P-bodies, nuclear speckles) across human and model organisms?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A systematic, semi-automated integration of data from literature mining, MLO-specific proteomics, subcellular localization atlases, and biomolecular interaction networks can produce a 'condensatome' atlas of significantly greater scope and confidence than existing manually curated lists. \n*   **Expected Outcome & Validation:** We will deliver a publicly accessible database, the 'Condensatome Atlas,' containing thousands of MLO components, each with a confidence score based on the convergence of multiple lines of evidence. We will validate the quality of our newly identified components by demonstrating a statistically significant enrichment for known LLPS-driving biophysical features (e.g., intrinsic disorder, multivalency) compared to the background proteome, and by confirming co-localization patterns using independent imaging data.\n\n**Aim 2: To develop a predictive framework that maps molecular features to condensate partitioning.**\nThis aim tackles the central 'specificity problem' by moving beyond simple propensity prediction to model the specific partitioning of biomolecules into distinct condensates.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** Can a machine learning model, trained on integrated molecular and network features, learn the combinatorial 'rules' that determine a biomolecule's specific MLO destination?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** The partitioning of a protein or RNA into a specific condensate is an emergent property determined by a unique, multi-scale 'feature signature' encompassing its intrinsic sequence/domain properties (the 'letters') and its position within the cellular interaction network (the 'syntax'). A multi-modal machine learning model can decipher this complex grammar.\n*   **Expected Outcome & Validation:** We will develop a novel computational tool that, given a protein or RNA sequence, predicts its partitioning probability across a range of MLOs. The model's performance will be rigorously assessed using cross-validation on held-out data, and its predictions will be benchmarked against newly published experimental data not used in training. Crucially, by using model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP), we will extract the key feature combinations that define the 'zip code' for each MLO, providing concrete, testable biological insights.\n\n**Aim 3: To model the dynamic regulation of condensate composition and material properties.**\nThis aim addresses the 'context-dependency problem' by simulating how cellular signals remodel MLOs.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** How do post-translational modifications (PTMs) and changes in component stoichiometry dynamically regulate the composition, size, and predicted biophysical properties of MLOs?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** PTMs function as tunable molecular 'switches' that modify the valency and interaction strengths of MLO components, thereby altering phase boundaries and competitive partitioning. These dynamic effects can be computationally modeled by integrating PTM site data and context-specific gene expression data into our predictive framework.\n*   **Expected Outcome & Validation:** We will create a dynamic simulation platform that predicts how MLOs are remodeled in response to specific cellular states (e.g., stress, mitosis). We will validate our model's predictions by comparing them against publicly available time-course proteomics and imaging datasets of MLOs under perturbation. For instance, our model should correctly predict the dissolution of certain condensates upon widespread phosphorylation during mitosis, a known biological phenomenon. This will provide the first quantitative framework for understanding the dynamic regulation of cellular compartmentalization.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group, leveraging a purely computational, data-synthesis approach that is perfectly aligned with the research call. Our methodology is structured around our three research aims and emphasizes collaboration, reproducibility, and open science principles.\n\n**Working Group Structure and Collaboration Plan:**\nThe project's success hinges on the integration of diverse expertise. We will form a working group with three specialized sub-teams: \n1.  **Data Curation & Ontology Team:** Comprised of cell biologists and bioinformaticians, this team will lead Aim 1. They will use their domain knowledge to guide automated data extraction and ensure the biological relevance of the integrated 'Condensatome Atlas'.\n2.  **Machine Learning & Modeling Team:** Led by computational scientists and biophysicists, this team will spearhead Aim 2. They will develop and implement the multi-modal machine learning architecture for predicting MLO partitioning.\n3.  **Dynamic Systems & Physics Team:** Including systems biologists and theoretical physicists, this team will focus on Aim 3, developing models to simulate the dynamic regulation of condensates. \nCollaboration will be maintained through bi-weekly virtual meetings, a shared Slack workspace, and a centralized project management platform. All code and analysis pipelines will be version-controlled on a shared GitHub repository. An annual in-person workshop will be held to facilitate intensive brainstorming, cross-team training, and strategic planning.\n\n**Aim 1: Building the 'Condensatome' Atlas**\n*   **Data Sources:** We will exclusively use publicly available data. Key sources include: (i) **Literature:** The entire PubMed Central Open Access subset will be mined using NLP tools (e.g., BERN, PubTator) to extract protein/gene-MLO associations. (ii) **Proteomics:** Data from MLO purification-mass spectrometry studies will be aggregated from PRIDE, MassIVE, and CPTAC. (iii) **Localization:** The Human Protein Atlas, Compartments DB, and GO annotations will provide cellular location evidence. (iv) **Interactions:** Protein-protein interactions will be sourced from BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct. Protein-RNA interactions will be sourced from RBPDB, POSTAR3, and ENCODE eCLIP datasets. (v) **Gold Standards:** Known LLPS-driving proteins from PhaSepDB, LLPSDB, and DrLLPS will serve as positive controls and training seeds.\n*   **Integration and Annotation:** We will construct a heterogeneous graph database (using Neo4j or similar) where nodes represent biomolecules and edges represent different types of evidence (e.g., 'co-localizes_with', 'interacts_with', 'co-mentioned_in_literature'). Each piece of evidence will be weighted, and a final confidence score for each molecule's association with a given MLO will be calculated using a Bayesian integration framework.\n\n**Aim 2: Predictive Modeling of LLPS and Partitioning**\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A comprehensive feature vector will be generated for every human protein. This vector will include: (i) **Sequence Features:** Amino acid composition, charge (SCD, κ), hydropathy, intrinsic disorder scores (from IUPred2A, MobiDB), low-complexity regions (from SEG), and patterns of aromatic/cationic residues. (ii) **Structural/Domain Features:** Pfam domain annotations, known interaction motifs (e.g., SH3, PRM), and structural properties derived from AlphaFold2 models (e.g., solvent accessible surface area). (iii) **Network Features:** Graph-based metrics (degree, centrality, clustering coefficient) derived from the interaction networks built in Aim 1.\n*   **Machine Learning Model:** We will develop a multi-modal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This architecture is ideal as it can simultaneously learn from both the node features (sequence/structural properties) and the graph topology (interaction network). The model will be trained on the high-confidence atlas from Aim 1 to perform multi-class classification, assigning each protein to its most likely MLO. To decipher the 'grammar', we will employ model interpretability methods like SHAP and integrated gradients to identify the specific features that drive partitioning into each condensate class.\n\n**Aim 3: Modeling Dynamic Regulation**\n*   **Dynamic Data Integration:** We will augment our feature set by incorporating data from: (i) **PTM Databases:** PhosphoSitePlus and dbPTM will be used to map known modification sites onto our protein set. (ii) **Expression Atlases:** Context-specific protein and RNA abundance levels will be obtained from GTEx, TCGA, and relevant perturbation experiments in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).\n*   **Simulation Framework:** We will model dynamics by perturbing our trained GCN model. To simulate PTMs, we will alter the input features of a protein (e.g., adding negative charges to simulate phosphorylation) and observe the resulting change in its predicted MLO partitioning probability. To simulate changes in cellular context, we will use expression data to weight the nodes in our interaction graph. We can then use network propagation algorithms to predict how shifts in the abundance of key 'scaffold' proteins might sequester or release 'client' proteins, thereby remodeling the entire condensatome.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of data integration pipeline and release of 'Condensatome Atlas' v1.0. First working group publication submitted.\n*   **Year 2:** Development, training, and validation of the predictive GCN model. Launch of a public web server for MLO partitioning prediction. Second manuscript submitted.\n*   **Year 3:** Development of the dynamic simulation framework. Integration of all tools into a unified open-source platform. Final summary publications and dissemination at international conferences.",

The deliverables are designed to be foundational resources and tools that empower the entire scientific community, consistent with the collaborative and open-science ethos of the research call.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Foundational Community Resource:** The primary deliverable, the 'Condensatome Atlas,' will be the most comprehensive, evidence-based, and computationally accessible catalog of membraneless organelle components. By integrating disparate data types under a unified ontological framework, it will serve as a definitive reference for researchers studying MLOs, analogous to the role of the Gene Ontology (GO) or KEGG pathways for their respective fields. It will enable researchers to quickly survey the known and predicted components of their condensate of interest, generating novel hypotheses for experimental validation.\n2.  **A New Predictive Paradigm:** Our project will deliver the first computational framework capable of predicting not just *if* a biomolecule undergoes LLPS, but *where* it partitions among the cell's diverse condensates. This moves the field from a descriptive to a predictive science. The machine learning model and its interpretation will reveal the combinatorial 'grammar'—the specific sequence, structural, and network motifs—that governs MLO assembly. This represents a fundamental breakthrough in understanding the emergent principles of cellular self-organization.\n3.  **A Framework for Dynamic Cell Biology:** By modeling the effects of PTMs and changing cellular conditions, we will provide the first systems-level, quantitative tool to investigate the dynamic regulation of cellular compartmentalization. This will bridge the gap between static parts lists of condensates and the dynamic, responsive behavior of living cells, providing a powerful new lens to study processes like the stress response, cell division, and signaling.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Understanding Human Disease:** The dysregulation of MLOs is a hallmark of numerous diseases, including ALS, Alzheimer's, and various cancers. Our predictive tools will allow researchers to input disease-associated mutations (e.g., in FUS, TDP-43, or oncogenic fusion proteins) and predict how they alter MLO partitioning and properties. This will generate concrete, mechanistic hypotheses about disease pathogenesis and identify potential nodes for therapeutic intervention.\n*   **Enabling Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** A predictive understanding of the MLO grammar will empower the rational design of synthetic organelles. Researchers will be able to engineer proteins with custom 'zip codes' to target them to specific condensates or to create entirely novel, orthogonal compartments for applications in metabolic engineering, bioremediation, and the construction of complex cellular circuits.\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Data-Driven Biologists:** This project is an ideal training environment for graduate students and postdocs. Trainees will work in a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team, gaining invaluable skills at the intersection of cell biology, biophysics, and data science. They will become fluent in machine learning, network theory, and large-scale data integration—the critical toolkit for the future data-savvy workforce, directly fulfilling a key goal of the research call.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science Strategy:**\nOur commitment to open science is unwavering. All deliverables will be made immediately and freely available to the community.\n*   **Open Data:** The 'Condensatome Atlas' will be accessible via a user-friendly web portal with full search and download capabilities.\n*   **Open Source:** All software, analysis pipelines, and machine learning models will be deposited in a public GitHub repository with permissive licenses and comprehensive documentation to ensure full reproducibility.\n*   **Open Access:** The predictive model will be deployed as a public web server and API. All research findings will be published in high-impact open-access journals and disseminated through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ASCB, ISMB). We will also organize training workshops to help the broader community utilize our resources effectively.",
        "budget_and_resources": "The proposed research is a community-scale synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of a single research laboratory and requires the unique support structure provided by NCEMS. The project does not require funds for experimental data generation; instead, the budget is focused on the personnel, computational resources, and collaborative infrastructure necessary to integrate and analyze vast, publicly available datasets.\n\n**Justification for NCEMS Support:**\nThe central challenge of this project is not the lack of data, but its fragmentation and complexity. Solving the 'grammar' of cellular organization requires a transdisciplinary team of cell biologists, biophysicists, polymer physicists, and machine learning experts to work in a deeply integrated fashion. Such a team is rarely found within a single institution and requires a dedicated collaborative framework. NCEMS support is essential to convene this working group, providing the resources for dedicated personnel to focus on data synthesis, for the computational power to process petabytes of information, and for the travel and coordination needed to foster genuine intellectual synergy. Traditional funding mechanisms are often ill-suited for projects of this nature, which prioritize synthesis and collaboration over new data generation. This proposal is therefore perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission.\n\n**Budget Breakdown (3-Year Project Estimate):**\n\n**A. Personnel:**\n*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2.0 FTE x 3 years):** Two full-time postdoctoral fellows will form the core of the project's analytical effort. Postdoc 1 (Bioinformatics/Cell Biology focus) will lead the development of the 'Condensatome Atlas' (Aim 1). Postdoc 2 (Computational/ML focus) will lead the development of the predictive and dynamic models (Aims 2 & 3). Their salaries and benefits are the largest component of the budget, reflecting the person-hours required for this intensive data synthesis work.\n*   **Graduate Students (2.0 FTE x 3 years):** Two graduate students will be supported to assist the postdocs, providing them with unparalleled cross-disciplinary training in data science and cell biology. This directly supports the NCEMS goal of training the future workforce.\n*   **Project Manager (0.25 FTE x 3 years):** A part-time project manager is critical for coordinating the multi-institutional working group, organizing meetings, managing the shared data and code repositories, and ensuring milestones are met.\n*   **Senior Personnel (0.5 month summer salary/PI/year):** Modest summer support for the lead PIs will allow them to dedicate focused time to scientific oversight, trainee mentoring, and manuscript preparation.\n\n**B. Travel:**\n*   **Annual Working Group Meeting:** Funds are requested to bring all PIs, postdocs, and students together for one 3-day in-person workshop per year. These meetings are indispensable for fostering deep collaboration, resolving complex challenges, and strategic planning.\n*   **Conference Dissemination:** Travel funds will support trainees in presenting project results at one major international conference each year, ensuring broad dissemination of our findings and resources.\n\n**C. Other Direct Costs:**\n*   **Computational Resources:** A significant allocation is required for cloud computing services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) to cover data storage, database hosting, and on-demand GPU access for training large-scale machine learning models.\n*   **Publication Fees:** Funds are budgeted to cover open-access publication charges for an anticipated 3-4 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals.\n\nThis budget is structured to maximize the collaborative and synthesis-oriented goals of the project, focusing resources on the people and infrastructure needed to turn fragmented public data into fundamental biological knowledge."

        "background_and_significance": "The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a foundational hallmark of cancer, enabling the rapid proliferation and survival of tumor cells in diverse microenvironments. First described by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, this phenomenon involves a complex rewiring of metabolic pathways to meet the increased demand for ATP, biosynthetic precursors, and redox homeostasis. While the Warburg effect—the preference for aerobic glycolysis—is a well-known example, it is now clear that cancer metabolic reprogramming is far more nuanced and heterogeneous. It encompasses alterations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutaminolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and lipid and nucleotide synthesis. This metabolic plasticity is not a monolithic entity but an emergent property arising from a complex interplay between a tumor's genetic drivers (e.g., mutations in TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA), its tissue of origin, and signals from the tumor microenvironment. Understanding the principles that govern this emergence is one of the most significant challenges in cancer biology and a critical step toward developing more effective, targeted metabolic therapies. \n\nThe last decade has witnessed an explosion in publicly available, large-scale cancer datasets, providing an unprecedented opportunity to dissect this complexity. Landmark projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have characterized the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of thousands of tumors across dozens of cancer types. More recently, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has added a crucial layer of proteomic data, offering a more direct proxy for enzymatic activity. Concurrently, repositories like the Metabolomics Workbench have begun to aggregate tumor metabolomic profiles. While these resources are invaluable, they are frequently analyzed in isolation. Most studies have focused on identifying correlations between a specific mutation and a downstream metabolic alteration within a single cancer type. This approach, while informative, has several key limitations. First, it often fails to capture the non-linear, systems-level effects through which genetic perturbations propagate through transcriptional and proteomic layers to ultimately reshape the metabolic network. Second, it struggles to explain how genetically distinct tumors can converge on similar metabolic phenotypes. Third, it may overlook therapeutic vulnerabilities that are not caused by the inhibition of a single mutated enzyme but are instead emergent properties of the rewired network—so-called 'network fragilities'.\n\nA critical gap in the field is the lack of a unified, pan-cancer framework to systematically map and classify these emergent metabolic states. We need to move beyond correlational analyses and build predictive models that mechanistically link genotype to metabolic phenotype. Such a framework would allow us to understand the common principles of metabolic reprogramming that transcend specific cancer types and driver mutations. This research is exceptionally timely. The maturation of multi-omic datasets, coupled with advances in network biology, machine learning, and constraint-based modeling, provides the necessary ingredients for a large-scale data synthesis project. A community-scale effort, as proposed here, is essential because the integration and analysis of these massive, heterogeneous datasets are beyond the scope and expertise of any single research lab. By assembling a multidisciplinary team of cancer biologists, systems biologists, and data scientists, this working group is uniquely positioned to synthesize existing public data to construct a Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States. This atlas will serve as a transformative resource for the community, providing a systems-level map of cancer metabolism, generating novel hypotheses, and identifying high-confidence therapeutic targets that are currently hidden within the complexity of multi-omic data.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The central goal of this working group is to systematically define and characterize the emergent metabolic states that arise in cancer and to leverage this understanding to predict novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. Our research is structured around three fundamental questions, each associated with a specific, testable hypothesis that will be addressed through the synthesis of public multi-omic data and the application of advanced network modeling techniques.\n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): How do diverse oncogenic drivers and tissue-of-origin contexts converge to produce a finite set of recurrent, emergent metabolic states across different cancer types?**\nWhile the genomic landscape of cancer is extraordinarily diverse, the functional requirements for proliferation—such as biomass production and energy generation—are conserved. This suggests that the vast number of possible genetic and epigenetic alterations may converge on a more limited set of stable, functional metabolic phenotypes. \n*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** Despite vast genomic heterogeneity, cancer metabolism converges on a limited number of discrete and recurrent metabolic states (e.g., 'High-Glycolytic/Low-OXPHOS', 'Lipogenic', 'Glutamine-Addicted'). These states are emergent properties defined by the collective activity of the entire metabolic network, rather than being dictated by a single driver mutation or tissue of origin.\n*   **Testing H1:** We will integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from thousands of pan-cancer tumor samples to generate a high-dimensional feature space representing the metabolic activity of each tumor. Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., consensus clustering, variational autoencoders), we will identify robust clusters of tumors that represent distinct metabolic states. We will then characterize these states by their dominant metabolic pathway activities and metabolite signatures. Our prediction is that tumors with disparate driver mutations (e.g., KRAS-mutant lung cancer and PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer) will co-cluster if their mutations perturb the underlying regulatory and metabolic network in a functionally convergent manner. The primary deliverable will be a comprehensive classification of pan-cancer metabolic states.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the key molecular mediators and network control points that govern the stability of cancer-associated metabolic phenotypes?**\nUnderstanding how cancer cells maintain a robustly altered metabolic state is key to identifying effective therapeutic strategies. We posit that these stable states are maintained by critical nodes within the integrated molecular network that act as control points.\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** The stability of each emergent metabolic state is governed by a small set of 'hub' nodes (genes, proteins, or metabolites) within the integrated multi-omic network. These hubs, characterized by high network centrality, act as crucial mediators that integrate oncogenic signals and control metabolic flux, and are not necessarily the most mutated or differentially expressed components.\n*   **Testing H2:** For each identified metabolic state, we will construct context-specific interaction networks that link genomic alterations to proteomic and metabolic changes. Using network topology analysis (e.g., calculating betweenness centrality, degree, and control centrality), we will identify putative hub nodes. We will then perform in silico perturbation analyses (e.g., simulating the removal of a node) to assess the impact of these hubs on the overall network stability and predicted metabolic output. We predict that perturbation of these hubs will cause a disproportionately large disruption to the cancer metabolic state compared to non-hub nodes. The deliverable will be a map of the key control points for each metabolic state.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can we identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities that are emergent properties of the network, representing metabolic liabilities specific to each state, regardless of cancer type?**\nThe ultimate goal is to translate our systems-level understanding into therapeutic hypotheses. A metabolic state-based classification offers a new paradigm for patient stratification.\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** Tumors classified within the same emergent metabolic state will share common metabolic dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically. These vulnerabilities are emergent properties of the rewired network and can be predicted by identifying nodes whose inhibition is synthetically lethal with the network configuration of a specific metabolic state.\n*   **Testing H3:** We will employ constraint-based modeling (e.g., Flux Balance Analysis) on our context-specific network models to simulate the functional consequences of gene/enzyme inhibition. For each metabolic state, we will perform genome-scale in silico 'knockout' screens to identify genes whose deletion is predicted to be selectively lethal (e.g., by blocking biomass production). To validate our predictions computationally, we will cross-reference our findings with experimental data from large-scale dependency screens like the DepMap project. We predict a significant enrichment of our high-confidence predicted targets among the essential genes identified experimentally in cell lines belonging to the corresponding metabolic state. The final deliverable will be a prioritized list of high-confidence, state-specific metabolic targets for future experimental validation.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed as a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary working group, leveraging the unique expertise of its members in cancer biology, metabolomics, systems biology, and data science. Our approach is organized into four sequential but interconnected phases, designed to systematically synthesize public data to build and analyze a Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States. This project will not generate new experimental data, adhering strictly to the research call's focus on data synthesis.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonized Integration (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase addresses the significant challenge of integrating diverse, large-scale public datasets. \n*   **Data Sources:** We will aggregate data from premier public repositories. Genomic data (somatic mutations, copy number variations) will be sourced from TCGA and ICGC. Transcriptomic data (RNA-Seq) will be obtained from the TCGA portal. Proteomic data (global and phosphoproteomic) will be sourced from CPTAC. Metabolomic data will be gathered from the Metabolomics Workbench and other public sources, including data from published pan-cancer metabolomic studies. We will initially focus on tumor types with overlapping data across at least three 'omic' layers.\n*   **Data Harmonization:** A dedicated team of data scientists, in consultation with domain experts, will perform rigorous data processing. This includes: (1) mapping all samples to a common, consistent patient/sample identifier system; (2) applying standardized data normalization procedures (e.g., TPM for RNA-Seq, z-scoring for proteomics/metabolomics); (3) implementing robust methods for handling missing values, such as k-nearest neighbor or Bayesian imputation, after careful evaluation of missingness patterns; and (4) mapping all molecular identifiers (genes, proteins, metabolites) to unified namespaces (e.g., Ensembl, UniProt, HMDB/KEGG).\n\n**Phase 2: Context-Specific Multi-Omic Network Reconstruction (Months 7-18)**\nOur core methodological innovation is the move from static, generic networks to dynamic, context-specific models for each tumor sample or small, homogeneous tumor cluster.\n*   **Network Scaffolding:** We will begin with a comprehensive human network scaffold integrating protein-protein interactions, signaling pathways, transcriptional regulation, and a genome-scale metabolic model (e.g., Recon3D). This scaffold represents the superset of all possible interactions.\n*   **Network Contextualization:** For each tumor sample, we will use its specific multi-omic data to tailor this generic scaffold. Transcriptomic and proteomic data will be used to infer the activity of specific pathways and the abundance of enzymes, effectively weighting or pruning edges in the network. Algorithms like iMAT or GIMME will be used to generate metabolic models that are consistent with the molecular profile of the tumor. Genomic data (mutations, CNVs) will be used to model the functional consequences of genetic alterations, such as the complete removal of a node for a loss-of-function mutation.\n*   **Integrative Network Inference:** To mechanistically link driver mutations to metabolic outputs, we will employ network-based integration algorithms like Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest (PCSF). This method identifies the most relevant subnetwork connecting known genetic alterations ('prizes') to observed changes in the proteome or metabolome, revealing the most probable signaling and regulatory pathways involved.\n\n**Phase 3: Identification and Characterization of Emergent Metabolic States (Months 19-24)**\nWith a collection of context-specific networks, we will identify recurrent patterns of metabolic organization across the pan-cancer cohort.\n*   **Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction:** From each tumor-specific network, we will extract a rich set of features, including predicted metabolic pathway fluxes, node centrality measures, and pathway enrichment scores. We will use dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP or PCA to visualize the landscape of cancer metabolism.\n*   **Unsupervised Clustering:** We will apply consensus clustering to these features to robustly partition tumors into distinct metabolic states (testing H1). The optimal number of clusters will be determined using multiple statistical metrics (e.g., silhouette score, cophenetic correlation).\n*   **State Characterization:** Each resulting cluster will be deeply characterized by identifying its defining molecular and network features, linking it back to driver mutations, tissue of origin, and clinical outcomes (testing H2).\n\n**Phase 4: Vulnerability Prediction and Computational Validation (Months 25-30)**\nThis phase will translate our network models into testable therapeutic hypotheses.\n*   **In Silico Perturbation Screening:** Using our context-specific metabolic models, we will perform systematic in silico gene knockout simulations via Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and related methods (e.g., MOMA). We will define a cancer-specific objective function (e.g., maximizing biomass production) and identify genes whose deletion is predicted to be selectively lethal for each metabolic state (testing H3).\n*   **Computational Validation:** We will validate our predictions against orthogonal experimental data. Specifically, we will compare our list of predicted vulnerabilities for each state with gene dependency scores from the DepMap project and drug sensitivity data from GDSC, stratifying cell lines by their corresponding metabolic state. A statistically significant overlap will provide strong computational validation for our approach.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of data harmonization pipeline (M6). Release of the integrated, curated pan-cancer dataset (M12). First-generation context-specific networks for 10 cancer types (M12).\n*   **Year 2:** Completion of pan-cancer network reconstruction (M18). Publication manuscript on the classification and characterization of emergent metabolic states (M24).\n*   **Year 3:** Completion of vulnerability prediction and validation pipeline (M30).

        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to produce a suite of transformative resources and fundamental new insights into cancer metabolism, with significant and lasting impact on both basic and translational cancer research. Our expected outcomes are tangible, impactful, and directly aligned with the research call's mission to catalyze community-scale data synthesis.\n\n**Key Deliverables and Scientific Contributions:**\n1.  **The Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States:** The primary outcome will be a comprehensive, publicly accessible resource that provides a systems-level map of cancer metabolism. This Atlas will be more than a static database; it will be an interactive web portal where researchers can explore the classification of metabolic states, visualize the underlying multi-omic data, query the network models for specific genes or pathways, and examine predicted vulnerabilities across dozens of cancer types. This will be the first resource of its kind to systematically classify functional metabolic phenotypes on a pan-cancer scale, moving the field beyond single-gene, single-cancer analyses.\n2.  **A Validated, Open-Source Computational Pipeline:** We will deliver a robust, reproducible, and well-documented computational workflow for the integration of multi-omic data and the construction and analysis of context-specific network models. This pipeline will be a valuable asset for the broader scientific community, enabling other research groups to apply similar systems-level analyses to their own data, not only in cancer but in other complex diseases. This directly addresses the call's goal to develop innovative analytical strategies.\n3.  **Fundamental Insights into Metabolic Reprogramming:** Our analysis will yield novel biological knowledge about the principles governing metabolic reprogramming. By identifying convergent metabolic states, we will uncover the common functional endpoints that are selected for during tumorigenesis, regardless of the specific initiating oncogenic event. The identification of network hubs and control points will elucidate the mechanisms that maintain the stability of these altered metabolic states, providing a deeper understanding of cancer's robustness.\n4.  **A Prioritized Compendium of Novel Therapeutic Hypotheses:** The project will generate a high-confidence list of predicted metabolic vulnerabilities, stratified by our novel classification of emergent metabolic states. These predictions, computationally validated against large-scale experimental screens, will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine for the cancer biology and drug development communities. This outcome has the potential to directly guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies and inform patient stratification strategies for clinical trials.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Advancing Precision Oncology:** Our work will pioneer a new paradigm for patient stratification. Instead of relying solely on genomic markers, clinicians may one day classify tumors based on their functional metabolic state, allowing for the selection of therapies that target the specific metabolic wiring of a patient's tumor. This functional approach could improve therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance to conventional treatments.\n*   **Fostering Collaborative, Open Science:** This project is a model for the type of community-scale, collaborative science that is necessary to tackle the complexity of modern biological data. By adhering to open science principles—making all data, code, and results publicly available—we will empower the entire research community, democratize access to complex analytical tools, and ensure the reproducibility and extension of our work.\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Scientists:** Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) are central to our working group. They will receive immersive, hands-on training at the intersection of cancer biology, computational biology, and data science. Through collaborative projects, dedicated workshops, and interaction with a multidisciplinary team of mentors, they will develop the skills necessary to lead the next wave of data-driven biomedical research, fulfilling a key objective of the research call.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**\nOur dissemination strategy is multi-faceted, including high-impact publications, presentations at international conferences (e.g., AACR, ISMB), and the development of the user-friendly Atlas web portal. We will also host workshops to train external researchers on our tools. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to be a living resource, continually updated as new public datasets become available (e.g., single-cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics). The foundational framework we develop can be readily adapted to study metabolic dysregulation in other complex diseases, ensuring the project's lasting impact and sustainability beyond the funding period.",

        "background_and_significance": "The human gut microbiome, a dense and diverse community of trillions of microorganisms, functions as a metabolic organ that is integral to host physiology. The concept of the human and their microbiome as a 'superorganism' or 'holobiont' has emerged from the recognition that host and microbial metabolisms are deeply and inextricably linked. This metabolic codependence is a classic example of an emergent phenomenon, where system-level properties, such as immune homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and disease resistance, arise from complex, multi-scale interactions that are not apparent from studying the host or microbes in isolation. The metabolic cross-talk between the host and gut microbiota is mediated by a vast array of molecules. Microbes ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, propionate, and acetate, which serve as a primary energy source for colonocytes and act as crucial signaling molecules that modulate host immunity and metabolism. Similarly, microbes transform host-derived primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, which regulate lipid metabolism and gut barrier function through receptors like FXR and TGR5. In turn, the host provides a nutrient-rich environment, secreting mucus glycans and other substrates that shape the microbial community structure. Disruptions in this metabolic symbiosis, termed dysbiosis, are implicated in a wide range of pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even neurological disorders. Despite the clear importance of this metabolic interplay, our understanding remains largely descriptive and correlational. A central challenge is the system's immense complexity. The human gut harbors hundreds of microbial species, each with a unique metabolic repertoire encoded by thousands of genes, interacting with a metabolically sophisticated host. Traditional experimental approaches, while essential, are often low-throughput and struggle to capture the system-wide dynamics. Computational modeling, specifically genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs), offers a powerful framework for addressing this complexity. GEMs are mathematical representations of an organism's entire metabolic network, and constraint-based modeling techniques like Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) can predict metabolic fluxes and growth rates under specific environmental conditions. In recent years, GEMs have been successfully constructed for individual gut microbes and have been extended to model simple microbial communities. Seminal works by Sung et al. (2017) and Heinken et al. (2019) have demonstrated the utility of community metabolic modeling in predicting metabolic interactions and SCFA production. However, these efforts face significant limitations. First, they often rely on a limited number of reference genomes, failing to capture the vast strain-level diversity present in the human gut. Second, and most critically, existing models rarely integrate a dynamic, tissue-specific host model. They typically treat the host as a static source of inputs and sink for outputs, ignoring the bidirectional feedback and metabolic co-regulation that define the superorganism. This leaves a critical knowledge gap: we lack a comprehensive, integrated, multi-kingdom modeling framework capable of predicting how diet and microbiome composition interact to produce an emergent systemic metabolic phenotype. This project is timely and significant because it directly addresses this gap. The recent explosion of publicly available multi-omics data—including thousands of metagenomes, host tissue-specific transcriptomes, and large-scale metabolomic profiles—provides an unprecedented opportunity for data synthesis. By integrating these disparate datasets, we can move beyond modeling microbes in isolation and construct a truly holistic model of the host-microbiome superorganism. Such a model is essential for transitioning from correlation to causation in microbiome research and for developing a mechanistic understanding of how this symbiosis shapes human health and disease.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is designed to address fundamental questions about the emergent metabolic properties of the host-microbiome superorganism. By synthesizing vast, publicly available multi-kingdom data into a unified computational framework, we will move beyond correlational studies to generate and test mechanistic hypotheses about metabolic codependence. Our research is structured around three central questions, each with specific, testable hypotheses.\n\n**Research Question 1: How do inter-kingdom metabolic dependencies and cross-feeding networks determine the systemic metabolite profile?**\nWe posit that the concentrations of key metabolites in circulation and stool are not simply additive contributions from host and microbe, but emergent properties of a highly structured metabolic network. This leads to our first hypothesis:\n*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** The production of critical signaling metabolites, such as secondary bile acids and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is contingent upon multi-step, inter-species, and inter-kingdom metabolic pathways. We predict that our integrated model will show that no single microbe, nor the host alone, can efficiently produce the observed profile of these metabolites from a standard dietary input. Instead, the model will reveal specific metabolic handoffs, where, for example, Firmicutes species perform the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates, Bacteroides species ferment the resulting oligosaccharides to propionate, and other species convert host-derived primary bile acids into signaling molecules like deoxycholic acid.\n*   **Validation:** We will test this hypothesis by simulating metabolic flux through the integrated network under a defined 'average Western diet' input. The model's predicted output of stool and systemic (absorbable) metabolites will be quantitatively compared against measured concentrations from public metabolomic datasets (e.g., from the American Gut Project cohorts). A strong correlation between predicted and observed metabolite profiles will support our hypothesis. We will further perform in silico 'tracer' experiments, tracking the flow of specific atoms (e.g., carbon from dietary fiber) through the network to explicitly map the predicted cross-feeding pathways.\n\n**Research Question 2: Can we identify keystone species or guilds whose metabolic functions are disproportionately critical for the stability and function of the entire host-microbiome metabolic network?**\nThe concept of 'keystone species' is well-established in macro-ecology, but its application to the microbiome is often based on abundance or phylogenetic position. We propose a functional definition based on metabolic contribution.\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** The stability of the host-microbiome metabolic network relies on a small subset of 'keystone' organisms or functional guilds that perform non-redundant, rate-limiting metabolic transformations. We predict that the in silico removal of these specific organisms (e.g., primary fiber degraders like *Bifidobacterium longum* or hydrogen-consuming methanogens) will cause a systemic collapse or significant alteration in the network's output, far greater than the removal of more metabolically redundant species. This disruption will manifest as a sharp decrease in the production of key metabolites like butyrate and an accumulation of intermediate metabolites.\n*   **Validation:** We will systematically perform single-species 'knockout' simulations in our community model. For each simulation, we will quantify the change in the overall community metabolic output (e.g., total SCFA production, vitamin biosynthesis) and the flux distribution across the entire network. Species whose removal causes a statistically significant and disproportionately large impact on these system-level metrics will be identified as keystone species. The predicted metabolic impact of removing these keystones (e.g., loss of butyrate) will be compared to clinical data from studies involving targeted antibiotic treatments that are known to eliminate specific microbial groups.\n\n**Research Question 3: How do clinically relevant perturbations, such as dietary shifts or antibiotic administration, propagate through the integrated metabolic network to alter systemic metabolic states?**\nA truly predictive model must be able to simulate the system's response to external pressures. We will use our framework to explore the emergent consequences of such perturbations.\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** The metabolic consequences of dietary and antibiotic perturbations are predictable outcomes of network-level flux redistributions. Specifically, we predict that: (a) shifting the model's dietary input from a low-fiber to a high-fiber composition will increase the total flux towards SCFA production by over 50% and shift the butyrate/propionate ratio, consistent with clinical observations. (b) Simulating broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment by removing all susceptible species from the model will lead to a >90% reduction in fiber degradation and secondary bile acid synthesis, creating a predicted 'vacant' metabolic niche that can be exploited by opportunistic pathogens like *Clostridioides difficile* if its GEM is introduced.\n*   **Validation:** The predictions from these perturbation simulations will be validated against public datasets from human intervention studies. For diet, we will use data from controlled feeding studies that report changes in fecal SCFA levels in response to fiber supplementation. For antibiotics, we will use multi-omics data from cohorts undergoing antibiotic therapy, comparing our model's predicted changes in the metabolome with the actual measured changes.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will synthesize publicly available data using a multi-phase, systems biology approach, culminating in a predictive in silico model of the host-microbiome metabolic network. Our methodology is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and scalable, fully embracing open science principles. The working group's diverse expertise in microbiology, immunology, nutrition, and computational biology is essential for the successful execution of each phase.\n\n**Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Aggregation and Curation (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase involves gathering and standardizing the disparate public datasets required for model construction and validation. We will not generate any new experimental data.\n*   **Microbial Genomics Data:** We will source thousands of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and reference genomes of human gut microbes from public repositories like NCBI GenBank, the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, and curated datasets from large-scale cohort studies such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT. This will ensure our models capture a broad and representative sample of the microbial diversity.\n*   **Host Omics Data:** To contextualize the host side of the model, we will utilize tissue-specific transcriptomic data for the transverse colon and terminal ileum from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. This data will inform which metabolic reactions are active in gut epithelial cells. This will be supplemented with protein abundance data from the Human Protein Atlas to further refine the host metabolic network.\n*   **Metagenomic and Metatranscriptomic Data:** We will download processed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from cohorts like HMP and the American Gut Project (AGP). This data will be used to determine the relative abundance of microbial species and the expression levels of their metabolic genes in different individuals, allowing us to create personalized or population-level community models.\n*   **Metabolomics Data:** For model validation, we will curate publicly available targeted and untargeted metabolomic data from human stool and blood samples from repositories like MetaboLights and the NIH Common Fund's Metabolomics Workbench. We will focus on datasets that have accompanying microbiome and dietary data to enable direct comparison with our model's predictions.\n\n**Phase 2: Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GEM) Reconstruction (Months 4-15)**\nWe will construct a comprehensive library of high-quality GEMs for both microbial species and the human host.\n*   **Microbial GEMs:** Using the curated genomes from Phase 1, we will employ an automated, high-throughput pipeline to reconstruct thousands of microbial GEMs. We will primarily use the CarveMe software, which leverages a universal model of prokaryotic metabolism to 'carve' species-specific models based on genomic evidence. Each reconstructed model will be subjected to quality control, including gap-filling to ensure biomass production and manual curation for key pathways (e.g., SCFA production) based on literature evidence. This library of models will be a major deliverable of our project.\n*   **Host GEM:** We will adapt the latest human metabolic reconstruction, Recon3D, to create a specific model for a human colonocyte. We will use the GIMME algorithm (Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism and Expression) along with the GTEx transcriptomic and Human Protein Atlas proteomic data to prune the generic human model, retaining only the reactions and pathways expressed in gut epithelial tissue. This tissue-specific model will be crucial for accurately representing host-microbe metabolic exchange.\n\n**Phase 3: Integrated Host-Microbiome Community Model Assembly (Months 12-24)**\nThis phase involves integrating the individual GEMs into a cohesive, multi-kingdom community model.\n*   **Community Modeling Framework:** We will use the MICOM (Microbial Community Modeling) framework, a Python-based tool specifically designed for modeling large-scale microbial communities. For a given individual's metagenomic data, MICOM assembles a community model by including the GEMs of all detected species, weighted by their relative abundance.\n*   **Host-Microbe Integration:** We will extend the standard community modeling approach by explicitly coupling the microbial community model with our colonocyte host model. This will be achieved by creating a shared 'lumen' compartment and a 'host' compartment, linked by transport reactions across the epithelial barrier. These reactions will represent the uptake of microbial-produced metabolites (e.g., SCFAs, vitamins) by the host and the secretion of host-derived substrates (e.g., mucus components, primary bile acids) into the lumen. The stoichiometry and directionality of these exchange reactions will be constrained based on known physiological parameters and literature.\n\n**Phase 4: Simulation, Hypothesis Testing, and Validation (Months 20-36)**\nWith the integrated model assembled, we will perform simulations to test our hypotheses.\n*   **Simulation Engine:** We will use constraint-based modeling techniques, primarily Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), to predict steady-state metabolic flux distributions. The objective function will be to maximize the growth rates of all organisms in the community, a common assumption in microbiome modeling.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing:** \n    *   **H1 (Cross-feeding):** We will define a simulated dietary input based on average nutrient composition of a Western diet and run FBA. We will analyze the predicted exchange fluxes between species and between the community and the host to map the metabolic handoffs. The predicted fecal and absorbed metabolite profiles will be correlated with curated metabolomics data for validation.\n    *   **H2 (Keystone Species):** We will perform systematic single-species removal simulations. For each removal, we will re-run the FBA and calculate the resulting change in key community metabolic outputs. Statistical analysis will identify species whose removal leads to an outlier effect size.\n    *   **H3 (Perturbations):** We will simulate dietary shifts by altering the nutrient composition of the model's input 'media'. Antibiotic effects will be simulated by removing classes of organisms known to be susceptible to specific antibiotics. The predicted changes in metabolite outputs will be compared to data from corresponding human intervention studies.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete data aggregation (M6). Establish and benchmark the microbial GEM reconstruction pipeline (M9). Deliver a library of >1,000 curated microbial GEMs (M12).\n*   **Year 2:** Complete host model contextualization (M18). Develop and validate the integrated host-microbiome modeling framework (M21). Perform initial simulations and validation for H1 (M24).\n*   **Year 3:** Conduct systematic knockout simulations for H2 (M30). Complete perturbation simulations for H3 (M33). Finalize data analysis, prepare manuscripts, and publicly release all models, code, and workflows (M36).",

Computational Resources ($120,000):**\nThe reconstruction of thousands of GEMs and the simulation of complex community models are computationally intensive tasks that require access to high-performance computing (HPC).\n*   **Cloud Computing Credits / HPC Access:** We request $40,000 per year for either the purchase of time on a national HPC cluster or for credits on a commercial cloud platform (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud). This will provide the necessary computational power for parallelized model reconstruction, large-scale FBA simulations, and data storage.\n\n**3. Travel and Collaboration ($75,000):**\nFacilitating strong collaboration within the geographically distributed working group is paramount.\n*   **Working Group Meetings:** We budget for annual in-person meetings of the entire working group (PIs, postdocs, students). These intensive, two-day workshops are critical for brainstorming, troubleshooting, and planning the next phases of the project. ($15,000/year = $45,000).\n*   **Conference Travel:** We request funds for the postdocs and students to present their findings at one major international conference per year (e.g., ISMB, Microbiome Keystone Symposia). This is essential for disseminating our results and receiving feedback from the broader scientific community. ($5,000/year/trainee = $30,000).\n\n**4. Publication Costs ($15,000):**\nIn accordance with our commitment to open science, we will publish our findings in open-access journals. We budget for anticipated article processing charges (APCs) for 3-4 major publications. ($5,000/publication).\n\n**5. Indirect Costs (F&A) ($175,000):**\nIndirect costs are calculated at a negotiated rate of 21.5% of the total direct costs ($810,000). This support is critical for the institutional infrastructure that makes this research possible.\n\n**Justification for NCEMS Support:** This project is uniquely suited for NCEMS support. The synthesis of multi-kingdom omics data, the reconstruction of thousands of metabolic models, and the integration into a predictive framework requires a level of computational infrastructure and collaborative, interdisciplinary expertise that is not available in a single lab or through existing collaborations. The project's focus on an emergent biological phenomenon and its commitment to open, reproducible science and trainee development align perfectly with the core mission of the funding organization."

        "background_and_significance": "The functionality of a eukaryotic cell is defined by the coordinated action of thousands of molecular machines—large, stable protein complexes that execute core processes such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein degradation. These machines, including the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome, are marvels of molecular engineering, often composed of dozens of unique protein and RNA subunits. A central, unresolved question in biology is how this staggering complexity emerged from simpler ancestral components over billions of years of evolution. Answering this question is key to understanding the origins of cellular organization and the principles that govern biological innovation.\n\nThe current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data but a deficit of integration. Over the past two decades, genomics has provided the complete protein-coding repertoires for thousands of species across the tree of life. Concurrently, structural biology, supercharged by the cryo-EM revolution, has delivered near-atomic resolution snapshots of these machines in various functional states. Finally, high-throughput proteomics has mapped the intricate web of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that form the basis of these complexes. Seminal studies have leveraged these data types in isolation or in limited combination to study the evolution of individual complexes. For instance, analyses of the ribosome have revealed its ancient RNA core, with proteins being added in successive layers, suggesting an accretionary model of evolution (e.g., Petrov et al., 2015). Similarly, work on the nuclear pore complex has traced its origins to a simpler membrane-coating machinery (Field & D'Souza, 2020). Ancestral sequence reconstruction has been powerfully applied to single proteins to trace their functional evolution (Thornton, 2013), but its application to entire complexes remains nascent.\n\nDespite these advances, significant gaps in our knowledge persist, primarily due to data fragmentation and the lack of a unified analytical framework. Genomic, structural, and interactomic data reside in disparate public databases (e.g., NCBI, PDB, BioGRID) and are rarely synthesized on a large scale. Consequently, our understanding of complex evolution is piecemeal, based on bespoke studies of a few well-characterized systems. We lack general principles that describe how molecular machines evolve. Are there common assembly pathways? What is the role of gene duplication versus de novo gene birth in creating new subunits? How are interaction networks rewired to accommodate new components without disrupting core function? Answering these questions requires a systematic, integrative approach that is beyond the scope of any single research laboratory. Most studies are limited in their phylogenetic breadth or in the number of complexes they analyze, preventing the discovery of universal patterns.\n\nThis research is both important and timely. It is important because it addresses a fundamental question about the emergence of biological complexity, with profound implications for synthetic biology, where researchers aim to build novel molecular machines, and for medicine, as misassembly of complexes underlies numerous diseases. The project is timely because we have reached a critical inflection point in data availability and computational power. The exponential growth of public databases, coupled with advances in deep homology detection, phylogenetic methods, and AI-driven structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold2), makes a large-scale synthesis project not only possible but imperative. This working group, by bringing together experts in phylogenomics, structural biology, and network science, is uniquely positioned to bridge the existing knowledge gaps. By synthesizing public data to create a '4D atlas' of molecular machine evolution, we will provide an unprecedented view into the historical processes that built the modern cell.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this working group is to uncover the general principles governing the evolutionary assembly of multi-subunit protein complexes. We will achieve this by systematically reconstructing the evolutionary history of dozens of core eukaryotic molecular machines. Our research is structured around three central questions, each associated with specific, testable hypotheses.\n\n**Research Question 1: What are the relative evolutionary ages of the constituent subunits of major eukaryotic molecular machines, and do they follow a predictable spatial and topological pattern?**\nThis question addresses the fundamental chronology of assembly. We seek to determine when each component of a machine first appeared in evolutionary history.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a (The 'Assembly Kernel' Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that most protein complexes are built around an ancient, structurally and functionally central core of subunits that was established early in eukaryotic evolution (i.e., present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, LECA). Younger, more lineage-specific subunits were subsequently added to the periphery of this 'assembly kernel'.\n*   **Prediction:** A quantitative analysis will show a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between the evolutionary age of a subunit and its centrality within the complex. We predict that older subunits will have greater buried surface area, more interaction partners (higher degree centrality), and be more critical for connecting different parts of the complex (higher betweenness centrality) than younger subunits.\n*   **Validation:** We will calculate the evolutionary age of each subunit for ~50 major complexes using phylogenetic profiling across >2000 genomes. We will then compute structural and network centrality metrics for each subunit using data from the PDB and PPI databases. The correlation between age and centrality will be assessed using Spearman's rank correlation, with permutation tests to establish statistical significance. Support for this hypothesis would establish a fundamental principle of layered, accretionary growth.\n\n**Research Question 2: What molecular mechanisms drive the expansion and diversification of protein complexes?**\nThis question explores the genetic and physical processes that allow simple complexes to grow into more complex ones.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a (The 'Duplication-and-Divergence' Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that gene duplication, followed by sub- or neo-functionalization of the resulting paralogs, is the dominant mechanism for increasing the subunit complexity of molecular machines.\n*   **Prediction:** We will find that a significant fraction of subunits within a given complex are paralogs. Furthermore, we predict that recently duplicated paralogs will occupy structurally adjacent positions and share some interaction partners, reflecting their common ancestry. Over longer evolutionary timescales, they will have diverged to occupy distinct positions and engage unique partners.\n*   **Validation:** We will systematically identify all paralogous subunits within our set of complexes using sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis. We will map these paralog pairs onto the complex's structure and interaction network. We will test whether the structural and interaction-network distance between paralogs is inversely correlated with their divergence time. We will use ancestral sequence reconstruction to infer the interaction interfaces of the ancestral protein and model how they diverged in the descendants.\n\n**Research Question 3: How did the incorporation of new subunits enable novel biological functions and regulatory capabilities?**\nThis question links the evolution of structure to the evolution of function.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a (The 'Regulatory Periphery' Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that the ancient 'assembly kernel' typically performs the core catalytic or structural function of the machine, while younger, peripheral subunits are primarily responsible for regulation, linking the complex to other cellular pathways, and refining substrate specificity.\n*   **Prediction:** A functional enrichment analysis will show that Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to 'catalytic activity' or 'structural molecule activity' are significantly enriched among the oldest stratum of subunits. In contrast, terms like 'regulation of X', 'protein binding', or terms specific to a particular lineage's biology will be enriched among the younger strata of subunits.\n*   **Validation:** We will assign each subunit to an evolutionary age stratum (e.g., 'LECA origin', 'Opisthokont origin'). We will then perform a GO term enrichment analysis for each stratum within each complex. Statistical significance will be determined using a hypergeometric test with correction for multiple testing. Furthermore, we will use ancestral sequence reconstruction and structural modeling to build models of ancestral sub-complexes (e.g., the LECA proteasome) and analyze their functional potential, comparing it to the modern, fully-assembled machine.\n\n**Expected Deliverables:** Our work will produce a comprehensive database of subunit evolutionary ages, reconstructed assembly pathways for dozens of complexes, and a public web portal for visualizing these '4D' evolutionary trajectories.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will synthesize vast, publicly available datasets using a novel, integrated computational pipeline. Our multidisciplinary working group is structured into three synergistic teams—Phylogenomics, Structural & Network Biology, and Ancestral Reconstruction—to execute the project aims. The entire workflow is computational and does not involve new data generation.\n\n**Data Sources and Curation:**\nOur research is founded on the integration of four major types of public data:\n1.  **Genomic Data:** We will assemble a comprehensive and taxonomically balanced set of over 2,000 complete eukaryotic proteomes from NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl, and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), representing all major eukaryotic supergroups. This forms the basis for our evolutionary analysis.\n2.  **Protein Complex Definitions:** We will use the CORUM database (Comprehensive Resource of Mammalian protein complexes) as a high-quality, manually curated starting point to define the subunit composition of our target molecular machines. This list will be supplemented with data from species-specific databases and literature.\n3.  **Structural Data:** We will retrieve all available experimentally determined structures of the target complexes and their sub-assemblies from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For components lacking experimental structures, we will utilize high-confidence predicted models from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.\n4.  **Interaction Data:** We will aggregate a high-confidence physical interaction network for each complex from major PPI databases, including BioGRID, IntAct, and STRING. Interactions will be filtered to include only those supported by multiple lines of evidence or those directly observed in structural data.\n\n**Aim 1: Determining Subunit Evolutionary Age:**\nThis aim will be led by our Phylogenomics team. For each subunit of a target complex (e.g., human RPT1 in the proteasome), we will perform a deep homology search using its protein sequence as a query in an iterative HMM-HMM-based search (HHblits) against our custom database of 2,000+ proteomes. The resulting hits will be used to define protein families and infer orthologous groups using OrthoFinder, a method robust to gene duplication events. This process generates a presence/absence matrix for every subunit across our species tree. We will then use established methods for ancestral state reconstruction (both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, implemented in R packages like `ape` and `phytools`) to map the origin of each subunit to a specific node on a calibrated eukaryotic species tree (e.g., from TimeTree.org). This assigns each subunit to an evolutionary stratum (e.g., LECA, Opisthokonta, Metazoa), providing its relative evolutionary age.\n\n**Aim 2: Reconstructing Evolutionary Assembly Trajectories:**\nThis aim, led by the Structural & Network Biology team, integrates the age data from Aim 1 with structural and interaction data. First, we will construct a composite, structurally-resolved interaction graph for each complex, where nodes are subunits and edges represent physical interactions. We will then color the nodes according to their evolutionary age. To test the 'Assembly Kernel' hypothesis (H1a), we will calculate various centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness) for each node and structural properties (buried surface area, number of distinct interfaces). We will then use Spearman's rank correlation to test for a significant association between age and these metrics. To test the 'Duplication-and-Divergence' hypothesis (H2a), we will identify all paralogous pairs within each complex using phylogenetic analysis of the gene families from Aim 1. We will then calculate the structural distance and interaction-partner overlap (Jaccard index) for each pair and test for a negative correlation with their divergence time.\n\n**Aim 3: Inferring Ancestral Sub-complex Properties:**\nThe Ancestral Reconstruction team will lead this aim. To test the 'Regulatory Periphery' hypothesis (H3a), we will first perform a systematic Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis on the subunits within each evolutionary stratum for every complex. We will use a hypergeometric test with FDR correction to identify functions that are significantly associated with ancient versus more recently evolved components. To gain deeper structural insight, we will perform ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) for key ancient subunits. Using the gene families from Aim 1, we will build multiple sequence alignments and gene trees, and then use a maximum likelihood framework (e.g., PAML) to infer the ancestral protein sequences at key nodes (e.g., the LECA node). These inferred ancestral sequences will then be used as input for AlphaFold-Multimer to generate structural models of ancient sub-complexes. We will analyze these models for structural integrity, conservation of catalytic sites, and comparison of interaction interfaces with their modern counterparts.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Data aggregation, curation, and pipeline development. Execution of Aim 1: complete phylogenetic profiling and age determination for all subunits in ~50 core complexes. Milestone: A comprehensive database of subunit evolutionary ages.\n*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Execution of Aims 2 and 3: network analysis, ancestral reconstructions, and structural modeling. Interpretation of results, development of the '4D Atlas' web visualization tool, and preparation of manuscripts. Milestone: Submission of the primary manuscript and launch of the public web portal.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology by providing a fundamentally new, evolutionary dimension to our understanding of the cell's essential machinery. The expected outcomes will have a lasting impact on the field, with broad applications in basic science, biotechnology, and education.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\nThe primary outcome of this research will be the elucidation of general principles that govern the evolution of molecular complexity. By moving beyond single-complex studies to a large-scale, systematic synthesis, we expect to answer long-standing questions: Is complex assembly primarily an accretionary process built on ancient cores? What is the relative importance of gene duplication versus other mechanisms in generating novelty? How are function and regulation layered onto molecular machines over time? The discovery of such 'rules' of molecular evolution would represent a major conceptual advance, providing a predictive framework for understanding any multi-component biological system.\n\nA second major outcome will be the creation of a rich, publicly accessible data resource: the '4D Atlas of Molecular Machines'. This integrated database and interactive web portal will be the first of its kind, allowing researchers to visualize the evolutionary assembly of complexes through time. Users will be able to select a complex and see its subunits appear on a timeline, mapped onto its 3D structure and interaction network. This will not only be a powerful tool for hypothesis generation for the entire research community but will also serve as an invaluable educational resource for teaching the dynamic, evolutionary nature of the cell.\n\nFinally, we will develop and disseminate a robust, scalable, and transferable computational workflow for evolutionary data synthesis. This pipeline—integrating phylogenomics, structural analysis, and network biology—can be readily adapted by other researchers to study the evolution of other systems, such as metabolic pathways, signaling networks, or even ecological networks, thus amplifying the project's impact.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe insights gained from this work have significant potential for broader applications. In **synthetic biology**, understanding the natural design principles of stable, functional molecular machines can guide the de novo engineering of novel protein assemblies. For example, knowledge of how nature uses conserved 'kernel' subunits as scaffolds could inform the design of custom enzymatic pathways or targeted drug delivery vehicles. In **biomedicine**, our work will provide an evolutionary framework for understanding diseases of complex misassembly ('complexopathies'), which include many cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. By identifying the most ancient, conserved, and structurally critical interfaces, we can better predict which mutations are likely to be pathogenic and potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\nThis project is also intrinsically designed for **training and education**. It will provide a unique cross-disciplinary training environment for two postdoctoral fellows and a graduate student, equipping them with highly sought-after skills in computational biology, data science, and evolutionary analysis. They will be the vanguard of a new generation of scientists fluent in data synthesis. We will further broaden our educational impact by developing teaching modules based on our '4D Atlas' and by hosting a summer workshop in Year 2 to train the wider community in our methods.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science:**\nOur commitment to open science is central to this project. All source code for our analysis pipelines will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. All generated data, including subunit ages and ancestral sequences, will be deposited in Zenodo and made accessible through our web portal. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals (e.g., *eLife*, *PLOS Biology*) and present our work at key international conferences (e.g., SMBE, ASCB, ISMB) to ensure rapid and broad dissemination of our results and methods. The long-term vision is to establish this working group as a hub for evolutionary systems biology, expanding our framework to prokaryotic systems and fostering a collaborative community dedicated to understanding the origins of biological complexity.",

        "background_and_significance": "The concept of cellular identity emerging from the complex interplay of genes has been elegantly captured for over 60 years by Conrad Waddington's 'epigenetic landscape' metaphor. In this model, a pluripotent cell, represented as a ball at the top of a hill, rolls down a branching system of valleys, with each path leading to a distinct, stable cell fate at the bottom. This intuitive picture powerfully illustrates the robustness and directionality of development. However, despite its conceptual influence, the Waddington landscape has remained largely a qualitative metaphor. A central challenge in modern biology is to transform this metaphor into a quantitative, predictive, and data-driven mathematical framework. The recent explosion in single-cell genomics has provided the technological means to address this challenge. Technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) allow us to capture high-dimensional snapshots of the molecular state of thousands of individual cells as they undergo differentiation. This has led to the development of numerous computational methods for 'trajectory inference' (TI), such as Monocle, Slingshot, and PAGA. These tools order cells along a 'pseudotime' axis, revealing branching lineage pathways and identifying genes that change along these paths. While transformative, these TI methods are fundamentally descriptive. They reconstruct the paths cells have taken but do not model the underlying forces, or dynamics, that govern these transitions. They cannot, for instance, quantify the stability of a cell state, predict the outcome of a genetic perturbation, or explain why certain cell fate transitions are more probable than others. A new frontier of methods has begun to address these limitations by inferring cellular dynamics. RNA velocity, for example, leverages the ratio of spliced to unspliced mRNA transcripts to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of gene expression, providing a vector for each cell that points towards its likely future state. Tools like scVelo and dynamo have extended this concept to reconstruct a continuous vector field that represents the flow of cells through gene expression space. These approaches represent a critical step towards a dynamical systems view of development. However, significant gaps remain. First, most current methods do not explicitly reconstruct the potential landscape itself, which is essential for quantifying concepts like cell state stability (the depth of a valley) and transition barriers (the height of a ridge). Second, integrating multi-omic data—such as combining the fast timescale of transcription (scRNA-seq) with the slower timescale of epigenetic modifications (scATAC-seq)—into a single, coherent dynamical model is still in its infancy. Epigenetic changes are thought to shape the landscape itself, but current models rarely incorporate this explicitly. Third, the role of stochasticity is often treated as technical noise, yet biological evidence suggests that random fluctuations in gene expression are a crucial ingredient in development, allowing cells to explore different states and cross landscape barriers. This project is timely and important because it stands at the confluence of three enabling factors: the massive and growing repository of public single-cell multi-omic data from community efforts like the Human Cell Atlas; the increasing maturity of machine learning and dynamical systems theory to model complex, high-dimensional systems; and the pressing need in fields like regenerative medicine and cancer biology for predictive models of cell fate control. By synthesizing public data through the lens of statistical physics and dynamical systems, this working group will address a long-standing fundamental question in biology. We will move beyond mere description to build a predictive framework that can quantitatively map the Waddington landscape, identify its key molecular sculptors, and model the interplay of deterministic forces and stochastic fluctuations that drive cellular emergence.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This working group aims to transform the Waddington landscape from a qualitative metaphor into a quantitative, predictive framework by synthesizing public single-cell multi-omic data. Our research is structured around three central questions, each with specific, testable hypotheses.\n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can the high-dimensional state space and governing vector field of cellular differentiation be reconstructed from time-series single-cell data to quantitatively define the Waddington landscape's topology?**\nThis question addresses the core challenge of building the landscape itself. We move beyond simple trajectory plotting to model the underlying forces governing cell state transitions.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a (H1a):** The dynamics of cellular differentiation can be approximated as a gradient system, where the vector field of gene expression changes is the negative gradient of a potential function, U(x), representing the Waddington landscape. Stable, terminal cell types correspond to local minima (attractors) of this potential function.\n    *   **Prediction:** Our reconstructed potential landscape for well-characterized systems like hematopoiesis will exhibit distinct basins of attraction. The coordinates of these minima in gene expression space will correspond to the transcriptomic profiles of known mature cell types (e.g., erythrocytes, neutrophils). The depth of these basins, a measure of their stability, will correlate with the known robustness of these cell fates.\n    *   **Validation:** We will quantitatively compare the locations of predicted attractors with cell type annotations from the original studies. Using cross-validation, we will train our model on early and intermediate time points and test its ability to predict the distribution of cell types at the final time point.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b (H1b):** Cell fate decision points correspond to unstable saddle points on the potential landscape, and the ridges separating basins of attraction represent the energetic barriers to cell fate transitions.\n    *   **Prediction:** The model will identify saddle points along differentiation trajectories that co-localize with multipotent progenitor cells known to be at lineage commitment points (e.g., common myeloid progenitors). The calculated potential energy difference between a progenitor state and a transition state (saddle point) will quantify the barrier that must be overcome for differentiation to proceed.\n    *   **Validation:** We will compare the locations of predicted saddle points and the genes that define them with the known biology of lineage priming and commitment from the literature.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the core components of the gene regulatory network (GRN) and the key epigenetic modifications that sculpt the topology of the Waddington landscape?**\nThis question seeks to identify the molecular machinery that creates the valleys and ridges of the landscape.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a (H2a):** The landscape's geometry is primarily shaped by a core set of master transcription factors (TFs) whose interactions (e.g., mutual repression, auto-activation) create the stable attractors and bifurcations of the dynamical system.\n    *   **Prediction:** In silico perturbation of these identified TFs within our model will cause dramatic and predictable changes to the landscape topology. For example, knocking out a lineage-specific TF like GATA1 in a hematopoietic model will lead to the flattening or disappearance of the erythroid attractor basin.\n    *   **Validation:** We will identify candidate driver TFs using feature importance methods on our trained model. These predictions will be validated against extensive existing literature and, where available, public single-cell CRISPR perturbation datasets (e.g., Perturb-seq).\n*   **Hypothesis 2b (H2b):** Chromatin accessibility acts as a slower-timescale variable that modulates the faster transcriptional dynamics, effectively changing the shape of the landscape over developmental time.\n    *   **Prediction:** An integrated multi-omic model will show that the parameters of the transcriptional vector field are dependent on the chromatin state. For instance, the influence of a TF on its targets will be stronger when the chromatin at those target sites is accessible. Barriers on the landscape will correlate with regions of inaccessible chromatin.\n    *   **Validation:** We will build and compare the predictive accuracy of models trained with and without epigenetic data. We will analyze the learned dependencies to explicitly test if chromatin accessibility at TF binding sites is a strong predictor of that TF's regulatory influence in the model.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How does stochastic gene expression interact with the deterministic landscape to influence cell fate probabilities and timing?**\nThis question addresses the role of noise in development, treating it not as an error but as a functional component of the system.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a (H3a):** Cell-to-cell variability can be modeled as a diffusion process on the reconstructed potential landscape. The probability of a cell adopting a particular fate is determined by the interplay between the deterministic pull of the landscape's valleys and the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations.\n    *   **Prediction:** Stochastic simulations (using a Langevin equation) on our learned landscape will reproduce the experimentally observed proportions of different cell lineages emerging from a common progenitor pool. The model will also predict the distribution of transition times for cells to reach their final state.\n    *   **Validation:** We will compare the distributions of cell populations generated by our simulations against held-out experimental data from later time points using rigorous statistical metrics (e.g., Earth Mover's Distance).",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our project is a purely computational synthesis effort, organized into three synergistic phases executed by our interdisciplinary working group. We will leverage agile project management principles, with continuous collaboration via a dedicated Slack channel and a shared GitHub repository, complemented by quarterly in-person or virtual workshops.\n\n**Phase 1: Community Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase addresses the significant challenge of integrating heterogeneous public datasets.\n*   **Data Sources and Selection:** We will exclusively use publicly available data from repositories like the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), EMBL-EBI, and major consortia portals including the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), Mouse Cell Atlas, and Fly Cell Atlas. We will prioritize datasets that meet stringent criteria: (1) provide a time-course or developmental trajectory; (2) are multi-omic, ideally with paired transcriptomic and epigenomic readouts from the same cell (e.g., scNMT-seq, 10x Multiome); (3) originate from well-characterized biological systems to provide a 'ground truth' for model validation.\n*   **Initial Biological Systems:** We will focus on three canonical systems to develop and test our framework:\n    1.  **Murine Hematopoiesis:** The quintessential model of hierarchical differentiation, with a wealth of time-resolved scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.\n    2.  **Human Pancreas Development:** A clinically relevant system for understanding organogenesis and diabetes, with high-quality datasets from the HCA.\n    3.  **Cellular Reprogramming (e.g., Fibroblast to iPSC):** A controlled, engineered system that allows us to study how cells traverse a non-physiological landscape to acquire pluripotency.\n*   **Standardized Processing Pipeline:** We will develop and implement a reproducible data harmonization pipeline using the `Scanpy` and `Seurat` ecosystems. This pipeline will handle raw data processing, quality control, normalization, and batch effect correction across different studies and technologies using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Harmony, scVI). The output will be a set of unified, analysis-ready data objects, a key deliverable in itself.\n\n**Phase 2: Dynamical Model and Landscape Reconstruction (Months 7-18)**\nThis phase constitutes the core intellectual contribution of our project.\n*   **Vector Field Learning:** Our central goal is to learn a continuous vector field function, **F**(x), that maps a cell's high-dimensional state `x` (its gene expression profile) to its velocity vector `dx/dt`. We will first initialize this process by computing RNA velocity using `scVelo`'s dynamical model where applicable. We will then train a deep learning model, specifically a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), to learn the global function **F**(x) from the discrete snapshot data. This approach allows us to infer a continuous trajectory for any cell state, not just those observed experimentally.\n*   **Multi-Omic Integration:** To incorporate epigenetic data, we will develop a conditional Neural ODE. Here, the chromatin accessibility vector (from scATAC-seq) will serve as a condition that modulates the weights of the neural network defining the transcriptional dynamics. This formally models the hypothesis that the epigenetic state shapes the rules of gene regulation.\n*   **Potential Landscape Derivation:** Assuming the system's dynamics are dominated by gradient-like forces, we will decompose the learned vector field **F** into its gradient and curl components using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. The gradient component can then be numerically integrated to yield a scalar potential function U(x), our quantitative Waddington landscape. The minima, saddle points, and barriers of U(x) will be identified using standard methods from computational topology.\n*   **GRN Driver Identification:** The trained Neural ODE is not a black box. We will interrogate it to find key regulatory drivers. We will compute the Jacobian matrix of the vector field (∂**F**/∂x), which represents the local GRN interactions. Furthermore, we will use saliency maps and integrated gradients to rank genes based on their influence on the vector field at critical regions, such as bifurcation points.\n\n**Phase 3: Stochastic Simulation and In Silico Perturbation (Months 19-30)**\nIn this phase, we will use our model for prediction and hypothesis testing.\n*   **Stochastic Modeling:** We will extend our deterministic model (dx/dt = **F**(x)) to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form dx = **F**(x)dt + σ(x)dW. The diffusion term σ(x), representing biological noise, will be estimated from the local variance of gene expression in the data. This SDE model fully embraces the probabilistic nature of cell fate decisions.\n*   **Forward Simulation and Validation:** We will perform forward simulations by numerically solving the SDE, starting with populations of cells from early experimental time points. We will then compare the distributions of simulated cells at later time points with held-out empirical data. A close match in cell type proportions and transcriptomic distributions, as measured by metrics like the Wasserstein distance, will validate our model's predictive power.\n*   **In Silico Experiments:** A key outcome is the ability to perform experiments computationally. To simulate a gene knockout, we will modify the learned function **F**(x) to remove that gene's regulatory contributions and re-run the SDE simulations. This will allow us to predict how specific perturbations re-sculpt the landscape and alter cell fate outcomes, providing testable hypotheses for future experimental work.\n\n**Timeline and Open Science:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete data harmonization for all three systems. Release v1.0 of the vector field reconstruction pipeline. Submit first methods-focused publication.\n*   **Year 2:** Complete multi-omic integration and stochastic modeling framework. Perform in silico perturbations and validation for the hematopoietic system. Release v1.0 of the open-source software package.\n*   **Year 3:** Complete cross-system comparative analysis. Host a community training workshop. Submit major biological application papers. All code, models, and processed data will be made publicly available through GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will yield significant advances in our fundamental understanding of cellular biology and provide powerful new tools for the scientific community, with far-reaching impacts in medicine and biotechnology. Our expected outcomes are organized around intellectual merit, practical applications, and community building.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\n*   **A Quantitative Framework for Emergence:** Our primary contribution will be the development of a robust, generalizable computational framework to transform Waddington's qualitative landscape into a quantitative, predictive model. This moves the field beyond descriptive analysis of single-cell data towards a mechanistic understanding of how stable cell fates emerge from underlying molecular interactions. This directly addresses the research call's focus on fundamental questions of emergence in cellular biosciences.\n*   **Novel Biological Insights into Cell Fate Control:** By applying this framework to canonical systems like hematopoiesis and pancreas development, we will generate specific, novel biological hypotheses. We expect to identify previously unappreciated regulatory drivers at key decision points, quantify the relative stability of progenitor versus terminally differentiated states, and elucidate the precise role of chromatin remodeling in canalizing cell fate decisions. For example, our analysis of the non-gradient (curl) component of the dynamics may reveal regulatory motifs, like oscillatory feedback loops, that are critical for maintaining pluripotency.\n*   **A New Paradigm for Data Synthesis:** This project will serve as a powerful exemplar of synthesis research. By integrating dozens of disparate, publicly funded datasets, we will generate a holistic view of developmental processes that would be impossible to achieve from any single study. This demonstrates the immense scientific value that can be unlocked from existing data archives and provides a blueprint for future community-scale synthesis projects.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Accelerating Regenerative Medicine:** The ability to rationally design cell differentiation protocols is a holy grail of regenerative medicine. Our predictive framework will provide a platform for in silico screening of perturbation strategies. Instead of costly and slow trial-and-error in the lab, researchers could use our model to identify the optimal combination and timing of growth factors or transcription factor expression to guide stem cells to a desired therapeutic fate (e.g., insulin-producing beta cells) with high efficiency and purity.\n*   **New Perspectives in Cancer Biology:** Cancer can be conceptualized as a disease of a distorted epigenetic landscape, where malignant cells are trapped in abnormal, proliferative attractor states. Our methods can be applied to cancer datasets to map these aberrant landscapes, identify the oncogenic drivers that create them, and computationally screen for drug combinations that could destabilize the cancer state and push cells towards differentiation or apoptosis.\n*   **Training a New Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This inherently interdisciplinary project is an ideal training environment. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be co-mentored by experts in developmental biology, physics, and machine learning, gaining deep expertise that spans these fields. They will lead collaborative sub-projects, manage open-source code development, and present at international meetings. We will host a final, hands-on workshop to train the broader community in the use of our tools, directly fulfilling the call's mandate to train the future data-savvy workforce.\n\n**Dissemination Plan and Long-Term Vision:**\n*   **Open Science and Reproducibility:** Our commitment to open science is absolute. We will disseminate our work through:\n    1.  **High-Impact Publications:** Targeting journals like *Nature Methods* for the framework and *Cell* or *Science* for the biological discoveries.\n    2.  **Open-Source Software:** A well-documented and user-friendly Python package, `DynamoScape`, will be released with tutorials and example datasets.\n    3.  **Data and Model Portal:** A project website will provide interactive visualizations of the reconstructed landscapes and access to all processed data and trained models.\n*   **Long-Term Vision:** This project lays the groundwork for a 'Dynamical Cell Atlas'—a community resource that moves beyond cataloging cell types to mapping the rules that govern their transitions. In the future, this framework can be extended to incorporate spatial genomics to understand how tissue architecture constrains the landscape, and to comparative genomics to study how developmental landscapes evolve across species. This working group will catalyze a long-term collaborative community focused on a dynamical systems approach to biology.",

        "background_and_significance": "Allostery, the phenomenon where a perturbation at one site of a protein propagates to a functionally distinct, distant site, is a cornerstone of biological regulation. First conceptualized by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux in the 1960s to explain the cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, it has since been recognized as a ubiquitous mechanism controlling nearly every cellular process, from metabolic feedback inhibition to complex signal transduction cascades. This 'action at a distance' allows proteins to act as sophisticated information processors, integrating multiple signals to produce finely tuned functional outputs. The current state of the field is characterized by a deep but narrow understanding. Decades of research have yielded exquisitely detailed case studies of allostery in specific proteins, such as GPCRs, kinases, and transcription factors. These studies, employing techniques like X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, have revealed that allosteric communication is mediated by subtle, collective changes in protein structure and dynamics. Computationally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided atomistic views of these conformational transitions, while network-based models, representing proteins as graphs of interacting residues, have helped rationalize the pathways of communication. A pivotal advance came from the field of molecular evolution. The work of Ranganathan and colleagues on Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) demonstrated that residues forming allosteric pathways often co-evolve. This insight established a powerful principle: evolutionary history, captured in multiple sequence alignments, contains a record of the structural and functional constraints that shape allosteric mechanisms. Despite these advances, a profound gap in our knowledge remains: we lack a systems-level, proteome-wide map of allosteric regulation. Our understanding is a collection of isolated examples, not a comprehensive atlas. Experimental methods for identifying allosteric sites are low-throughput, costly, and often technically challenging, making a proteome-scale survey infeasible. Existing computational methods are typically applied on a one-off basis, require expert supervision, or rely on a single data type, limiting their predictive power and scalability. For instance, methods based solely on structure may miss dynamic effects, while those based on sequence alone lack physical grounding. This fragmentation prevents us from addressing fundamental questions about the emergent properties of cellular regulation. How are allosteric pathways architected across entire protein families? Are there universal 'design principles' for allosteric communication? How does the network of allosteric interactions within and between proteins give rise to robust cellular behavior? This research is critically important and timely because we are at a unique confluence of data availability and computational power. The explosion of public data—including massive sequence databases (UniProt), comprehensive structural repositories (PDB, AlphaFold DB), and extensive catalogs of human genetic variation (ClinVar, gnomAD)—provides the raw material for an unprecedented data synthesis effort. Concurrently, advances in machine learning, particularly graph-based neural networks, provide the ideal tools to integrate these heterogeneous data types and learn the complex patterns that define allosteric communication. Creating a map of the 'allosteric interactome' will not only transform our basic understanding of cellular signaling but also have profound translational impact. Allosteric drugs, which target regulatory sites rather than conserved active sites, promise greater specificity and novel modes of action. A comprehensive atlas of allosteric sites would provide a treasure map for the discovery of next-generation therapeutics, addressing the urgent need for new strategies to combat drug resistance and off-target effects.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this working group is to construct and validate the first proteome-wide map of the human allosteric interactome. By synthesizing co-evolutionary, structural, and functional genomics data, we aim to move beyond single-protein case studies to a systems-level understanding of allosteric regulation. This endeavor is guided by three central research questions and their corresponding testable hypotheses.\n\n**Research Question 1: Can the synergistic integration of co-evolutionary signals, structural dynamics, and functional mutation data systematically and accurately predict allosteric pathways within proteins on a proteome-wide scale?**\nOur central premise is that a multi-modal approach will capture a more complete picture of allostery than any single data type alone. Co-evolutionary data reveal functional constraints over geological timescales, structural network data provide the physical scaffold for communication, and functional data ground the predictions in physiological outcomes.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A machine learning model trained on integrated features from Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA), protein structure networks (PSNs), and known functional mutation data will significantly outperform models based on any single data type in predicting experimentally validated allosteric sites and pathways.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that our integrated model will achieve a substantially higher Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) on a curated benchmark set of known allosteric proteins (e.g., from the AlloSteric Database) compared to baseline models using only SCA, PSN metrics, or sequence conservation. We will rigorously test this using k-fold cross-validation and by evaluating performance on an independent hold-out test set of proteins not used during training or model selection.\n\n**Research Question 2: Do proteins within shared functional pathways or structural families exhibit common allosteric architectural principles or conserved 'design motifs'?**\nIf allostery is a product of evolution, we expect to find convergent solutions and conserved regulatory architectures among related proteins. Identifying these principles is key to understanding the emergence of complex regulatory networks.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Allosteric 'hub' residues—those predicted to be critical for propagating signals—are not randomly distributed but are enriched in specific structural motifs (e.g., at domain interfaces, in hinge regions) and are frequently targets of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that serve as regulatory switches.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that a network analysis of our predicted allosteric interactome will reveal clusters of proteins with similar allosteric network topologies, and that these clusters will significantly correlate with Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations and KEGG pathway memberships. We will validate this by performing statistical enrichment analyses, testing for significant co-localization of predicted allosteric hubs with known PTM sites (from PhosphoSitePlus) and domain boundaries (from Pfam), using permutation testing to establish statistical significance.\n\n**Research Question 3: How does disease-associated genetic variation perturb the allosteric interactome, and can this knowledge be used to identify novel therapeutic targets?**\nA vast number of disease-causing mutations occur far from a protein's active site, and their mechanism of action is often unknown. We propose that many of these act by disrupting allosteric communication.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** A significant fraction of pathogenic missense mutations cataloged in databases like ClinVar, particularly those distal to active sites, exert their deleterious effect by disrupting critical nodes or edges within allosteric communication pathways.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that our predicted allosteric pathways will be statistically enriched for known pathogenic mutations from ClinVar compared to presumed benign polymorphisms from gnomAD, even after controlling for confounding factors like residue conservation and solvent accessibility. To validate this, we will develop an 'allosteric disruption score' for every possible missense mutation in the human proteome. We will then test whether this score is a more accurate classifier of pathogenicity than established tools (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen-2), especially for the challenging class of non-active-site variants.\n\n**Expected Deliverables:** The successful completion of this research will yield: (1) A robust, open-source computational pipeline for proteome-scale prediction of allosteric regulation. (2) The 'Human Allosteric Interactome Atlas,' a publicly accessible, searchable web database for the scientific community. (3) A comprehensive map linking thousands of disease mutations to specific disruptions in allosteric signaling, providing novel mechanistic insights. (4) A series of high-impact, open-access publications detailing our methods, findings, and the community resource.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a transdisciplinary working group with expertise in computational biophysics (PI 1), bioinformatics and network biology (PI 2), and machine learning (PI 3). The research plan is organized into three synergistic aims, with specific roles for postdoctoral and graduate trainees to foster their development in a collaborative, data-intensive environment, directly aligning with the research call's training goals.\n\n**Aim 1: Curation of Integrated Datasets and Gold-Standard Benchmarks.**\nThe foundation of our synthesis project is the rigorous acquisition and harmonization of diverse public datasets.\n*   **Sequence Data:** We will compile multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for ~18,000 human protein families from the Pfam database. For families with insufficient sequence diversity, we will generate de novo MSAs using HHblits to search the UniRef100 database. Quality control will be stringent, filtering MSAs based on depth and coverage to ensure robust co-evolutionary signal.\n*   **Structural Data:** We will utilize all available experimental structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For the many proteins lacking experimental structures, we will leverage the high-quality, comprehensive models from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. All structures will undergo a standardized preprocessing pipeline: cleaning, protonation state assignment using PDB2PQR, and energy minimization using the OpenMM toolkit to relax any strained conformations.\n*   **Functional and Validation Data:** A 'gold-standard' training set will be meticulously curated from the AlloSteric Database (ASD), which catalogs proteins with experimentally validated allosteric sites and modulators. This will form our ground truth for supervised machine learning. For large-scale statistical validation, we will integrate: (1) pathogenic missense variants from ClinVar; (2) presumed benign population variants from gnomAD; (3) post-translational modification sites from PhosphoSitePlus; and (4) enzyme kinetic data from BRENDA.\n\n**Aim 2: Development of an Integrated Computational Pipeline for Allostery Prediction.**\nThis aim constitutes the core data synthesis effort, combining three analytical modules into a unified predictive framework.\n*   **Module 1: Co-evolutionary Network Inference:** We will implement a high-throughput Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) pipeline. For each protein family's MSA, we will compute a matrix of co-evolutionary scores between all pairs of residues. This identifies 'sectors' of co-evolving residues that often correspond to functional units and allosteric pathways.\n*   **Module 2: Structural Network and Dynamics Analysis:** For each protein structure, we will construct a residue-residue interaction network, or Protein Structure Network (PSN). Residues are nodes, and edges are weighted by the strength of inter-residue non-covalent interactions calculated using a distance-based cutoff. We will compute a suite of network centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality) for each residue to identify its importance in the physical communication network. To capture dynamic properties, we will perform Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) on an elastic network model of the protein to identify low-frequency collective motions that are often involved in allosteric transitions.\n*   **Module 3: Machine Learning Synthesis:** We will develop a machine learning model to integrate the features from Modules 1 and 2. Our primary approach will be a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which is naturally suited to protein structure data. Each residue (node) in the protein graph will be decorated with a rich feature vector, including its sequence conservation, co-evolutionary scores with all other residues, PSN centrality metrics, NMA-derived dynamics, and local structural properties (e.g., secondary structure, solvent accessibility). The GNN will be trained on our gold-standard dataset to learn a function that maps these integrated features to a probability that a given residue is part of an allosteric pathway. We will use 10-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation and employ techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the model and determine the relative importance of evolutionary, structural, and dynamic features.\n\n**Aim 3: Proteome-Wide Prediction, Validation, and Dissemination.**\n*   **Prediction:** The validated pipeline from Aim 2 will be deployed on high-performance computing resources to predict allosteric sites and pathways for the entire human proteome for which sufficient data is available.\n*   **Statistical Validation:** We will perform large-scale validation by testing for statistical enrichment of predicted allosteric sites in orthogonal datasets not used for training. Specifically, we will use Fisher's exact test to determine if our predicted sites are significantly enriched for: (a) ClinVar pathogenic mutations versus gnomAD variants, (b) known PTM sites, and (c) non-active-site drug binding pockets from DrugBank.\n*   **Dissemination:** In adherence with Open Science principles, all code will be shared on GitHub and all data will be deposited in Zenodo. The final, primary deliverable will be the 'Human Allosteric Interactome Atlas,' a public web portal with intuitive search and visualization tools.\n\n**Timeline:**\n*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition, preprocessing, and gold-standard dataset curation. Development and benchmarking of standalone SCA and PSN modules. First annual working group meeting.\n*   **Year 2:** Development and training of the integrated GNN model. Initial proteome-wide application to key families (kinases, GPCRs). Publication of the methodology paper. Second working group meeting.\n*   **Year 3:** Completion of proteome-wide predictions. Large-scale statistical validation. Development and public launch of the web database. Dissemination of results at conferences and through a capstone publication.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on medicine and biotechnology. By undertaking the first-ever systematic, proteome-wide synthesis of allosteric regulation data, we will create a foundational resource that shifts the paradigm from studying individual allosteric proteins in isolation to understanding allostery as a system-level, emergent property of the cellular network.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\nThe primary outcome will be the 'Human Allosteric Interactome Atlas,' a public database and visualization portal. This resource will provide the scientific community with testable hypotheses about the regulation of thousands of proteins, catalyzing new research directions. Our work will provide concrete answers to fundamental questions: What are the conserved architectural principles of allosteric communication? How has allostery evolved across different protein families? How do networks of allosteric interactions contribute to the robustness and adaptability of cellular signaling? By integrating evolutionary history with physical structure, our project directly addresses the research call's focus on understanding how emergent biological function arises from molecular properties.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n1.  **Revolutionizing Drug Discovery:** The most significant broader impact will be in pharmacology. The Atlas will serve as a blueprint for identifying novel allosteric drug targets across the proteome. Allosteric modulators offer key advantages over traditional active-site inhibitors, including higher specificity (as allosteric sites are less conserved) and the ability to tune protein activity rather than simply blocking it. This opens new therapeutic avenues for diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration and provides a powerful strategy to overcome the growing problem of drug resistance.\n2.  **Advancing Precision Medicine:** By systematically linking disease-causing mutations from ClinVar to the disruption of specific allosteric pathways, our project will provide novel mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of genetic disorders. This will enhance the interpretation of genomic data from patients, helping to classify 'variants of unknown significance' and suggesting personalized therapeutic strategies based on restoring or compensating for disrupted allosteric regulation.\n3.  **Enabling Protein Engineering and Synthetic Biology:** A deep understanding of allosteric design principles will empower protein engineers to create novel molecular tools. By manipulating the allosteric pathways we identify, researchers can design custom biosensors, molecular switches, and enzymes with precisely controlled activities for applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, and industrial catalysis.\n\n**Dissemination, Open Science, and Training:**\nOur commitment to Open Science is central to the project's design and aligns perfectly with the funding call's requirements. All software developed will be open-source and distributed via GitHub. All generated data and the final Atlas will be made publicly available without restriction. We plan for at least three high-impact, open-access publications to ensure broad dissemination of our methods and findings. Furthermore, the project is structured as a training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs will be co-mentored across disciplines, gaining invaluable experience in large-scale data synthesis, machine learning, and collaborative, reproducible science—skills essential for the future data-savvy workforce.\n\n**Potential for Follow-up Research and Long-Term Vision:**\nThis project will lay the groundwork for numerous future investigations. The working group will be ideally positioned to secure follow-on funding to: (1) Expand the Atlas to other model organisms, enabling comparative and evolutionary studies of allostery. (2) Integrate new data modalities as they become available, such as from cryo-EM and deep mutational scanning experiments. (3) Collaborate with experimental labs to validate high-priority predictions, closing the loop between computation and experiment. Our long-term vision is for the Allosteric Interactome Atlas to become a sustained, dynamic community resource, continually updated and expanded, that serves as an indispensable tool for the molecular and cellular sciences for years to come.",

        "background_and_significance": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes, enabling a single gene to produce multiple mRNA isoforms and, consequently, a vast diversity of proteins. It is estimated that over 95% of human multi-exon genes undergo AS, playing critical roles in development, cellular differentiation, and physiological homeostasis. The process is orchestrated by the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that recognizes specific sequences at exon-intron boundaries. However, the selection of these splice sites is not fixed; it is dynamically regulated by a complex interplay of cis-acting regulatory sequences within the pre-mRNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). This intricate network of interactions constitutes the 'splicing code,' which dictates splicing outcomes in a manner that is highly specific to cell type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. Dysregulation of this code is a hallmark of numerous human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and congenital defects.\n\nThe current understanding of the splicing code is fragmented. Early research identified canonical splice site sequences and key cis-elements, such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs/ISEs) and silencers (ESSs/ISSs). These elements serve as binding platforms for RBPs, primarily from the serine/arginine-rich (SR) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) families, which act as activators or repressors of splicing, respectively. However, these elements are often short, degenerate, and their functional effect is highly context-dependent, making simple motif-based prediction unreliable. The advent of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized the field. Large-scale projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) have used techniques like eCLIP-seq to map the binding sites of hundreds of RBPs across the transcriptome, providing a 'parts list' of the regulatory machinery. Concurrently, projects like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated RNA-sequencing data from tens of thousands of human samples, providing an unprecedented view of splicing variation across diverse tissues and disease states.\n\nDespite this wealth of data, a critical gap in knowledge remains: how do these components integrate to produce a quantitative, predictable splicing outcome? This is a problem of emergence, where the collective behavior of many interacting components (RBPs and cis-elements) gives rise to a complex, higher-level phenomenon (cell-type-specific splicing patterns). Previous computational models have tackled parts of this problem. For instance, models like MaxEntScan predict splice site strength based on local sequence, but they do not account for distal regulatory elements or the trans-acting environment. More recently, deep learning models like SpliceAI have achieved remarkable success in predicting splicing consequences of genetic variants using genomic sequence alone. While powerful, these models are inherently static; they cannot explain why a given exon is included in the brain but excluded in the liver, because they do not explicitly model the changing RBP environment. This project is timely and important because it proposes to bridge this gap. For the first time, the scale of publicly available data is sufficient to train a unified model that integrates genomic sequence (the 'hardware') with the cell-specific RBP expression profile (the 'software'). By synthesizing these massive, orthogonal datasets, our working group will develop a dynamic and predictive model of the splicing code. This will not only address a fundamental question in molecular biology but also create a powerful resource for interpreting the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variation, a major challenge in the post-genomic era.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research proposal is designed to address the emergent complexity of the splicing code through a large-scale data synthesis approach. Our overarching goal is to build and validate a quantitative, predictive model that integrates genomic sequence with the dynamic, cell-type-specific environment of trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to explain and predict alternative splicing outcomes. We have formulated three central research questions, each with a corresponding testable hypothesis, that will guide our investigation.\n\n**Research Question 1: Can a unified deep learning model that integrates cis-regulatory sequence and trans-acting RBP expression data accurately predict quantitative, context-specific splicing outcomes across diverse human tissues?**\n*   **Hypothesis 1:** A hybrid deep learning architecture that explicitly models both the genomic sequence context and the cell-type-specific expression levels of RBPs will significantly outperform models that rely on sequence information alone. The combinatorial information provided by the RBP expression profile is essential for predicting the quantitative variation of splicing across different cellular states.\n*   **Predictions:** We predict that our integrated model will achieve a substantially higher Pearson correlation and lower mean squared error between predicted and observed Percent Spliced In (PSI) values on a held-out test set of tissues compared to state-of-the-art sequence-only models. Furthermore, we predict the model's performance will be highest for exons known to be regulated by a large number of RBPs.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will train the model on a large subset of the GTEx dataset and evaluate its performance on unseen tissues and cell types. To directly test the hypothesis, we will perform ablation studies where the RBP expression input is removed or shuffled, quantifying the resulting drop in predictive accuracy. This will isolate and measure the contribution of the trans-acting environment to the model's success.\n\n**Research Question 2: What are the specific cis-trans interactions and combinatorial RBP codes that govern tissue-specific splicing programs?**\n*   **Hypothesis 2:** Tissue-specific splicing patterns emerge from the synergistic and antagonistic interactions of distinct ensembles of RBPs binding to a 'grammar' of cis-regulatory elements. The functional impact of a given sequence motif is not fixed but is conditional upon the cellular concentration of specific interacting RBPs.\n*   **Predictions:** Using model interpretation techniques (e.g., Integrated Gradients, in silico mutagenesis), we will identify sequence motifs whose predicted impact on splicing is significantly altered by changes in the expression levels of specific RBPs or RBP combinations. For example, we predict we will find enhancers that are active only in neuronal tissues due to their dependence on a combination of neuron-specific RBPs like NOVA and ELAVL1.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will systematically perform in silico 'perturbation' experiments, computationally altering the expression level of individual or pairs of RBPs and observing the genome-wide predicted impact on splicing. The resulting network of RBP-RBP functional interactions will be validated against known physical protein-protein interactions from databases like STRING and BioGRID. Furthermore, our model's predictions about key regulatory RBPs for specific tissues will be compared with published experimental results from RBP knockdown or knockout studies.\n\n**Research Question 3: How can a context-aware splicing model improve the interpretation of non-coding genetic variants and elucidate splicing dysregulation in disease?**\n*   **Hypothesis 3:** Our model, by accounting for the cellular context, can more accurately predict the pathogenic consequences of non-coding variants and identify the specific RBP dysregulations that drive aberrant splicing in diseases like cancer.\n*   **Predictions:** We predict that our model will assign significantly larger predicted splicing changes (ΔPSI) to known pathogenic variants from ClinVar than to common, benign polymorphisms from gnomAD. When applied to TCGA data, we predict the model will identify cancer-specific splicing signatures driven by the altered expression of specific oncogenic or tumor-suppressor RBPs (e.g., SRSF1, PTBP1).\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will benchmark our model's variant-scoring performance against other tools using curated variant datasets and, where available, experimental data from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). For cancer analysis, we will correlate the predicted splicing changes driven by specific RBPs with clinical outcomes, such as patient survival or tumor stage, to identify prognostically significant regulatory rewiring events. These findings will generate specific, testable hypotheses for future experimental validation.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that exclusively utilizes publicly available data, requiring the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary working group. Our approach is organized into three synergistic aims that encompass data integration, model development, and biological interpretation.\n\n**Aim 1: Curation and Integration of a Multi-modal Splicing Dataset.**\nThe foundation of this project is the construction of a comprehensive, harmonized dataset. This task is beyond the scope of a single lab due to the sheer scale and heterogeneity of the data sources.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will leverage three primary data types. 1) **Transcriptomic Data:** We will process raw RNA-seq data from the GTEx project (v8; ~17,000 samples across 54 tissues) and the TCGA project (~11,000 samples across 33 cancer types). 2) **Genomic Sequence:** The human reference genome (GRCh38) will provide the DNA sequence context for each splicing event. 3) **RBP Binding Data:** We will use processed eCLIP-seq peak data for ~150 RBPs from the ENCODE project to inform our model about potential RBP binding sites, although the primary RBP information will come from expression levels.\n*   **Data Processing Pipeline:** We will establish a reproducible bioinformatics pipeline using workflow managers like Snakemake or Nextflow. For RNA-seq data, reads will be aligned to the genome using STAR. We will then use LeafCutter to identify and quantify intron excision events, yielding Percent Spliced In (PSI) values for thousands of variable splicing events per sample. This event-based approach is robust and well-suited for detecting complex splicing changes. For each sample, we will also quantify the expression (Transcripts Per Million, TPM) of all known RBP-encoding genes.\n*   **Data Integration:** The final integrated dataset will be structured for machine learning. Each data point will represent a single splicing event in a single sample and will consist of: (i) the DNA sequence surrounding the event (e.g., 1kb centered on the cassette exon), one-hot encoded; (ii) a vector containing the expression values of ~1,500 known RBPs in that sample; and (iii) the target variable, the quantified PSI value for that event in that sample.\n\n**Aim 2: Development and Training of a Predictive Deep Learning Model.**\nOur central goal is to create a model that learns the splicing code from the integrated data.\n*   **Model Architecture:** We will develop a hybrid neural network. The first component will be a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes the DNA sequence as input. The convolutional layers are designed to automatically learn and detect relevant cis-regulatory motifs (like ESEs/ESSs) without prior specification. The output of the CNN, a learned embedding of the sequence's regulatory potential, will be concatenated with the RBP expression vector for that sample. This combined feature representation will then be fed into a series of fully connected (dense) layers, which will model the non-linear interactions between the cis-elements and the trans-acting environment to predict the final PSI value. The output layer will use a sigmoid activation function to constrain the prediction between 0 and 1.\n*   **Training and Validation:** The model will be implemented in Python using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. We will train the model on a large portion (e.g., 80%) of the GTEx dataset, using the mean squared error between predicted and observed PSI as the loss function. To ensure generalizability and prevent overfitting, we will employ a rigorous cross-validation scheme, holding out entire chromosomes or, more stringently, entire tissues during training and using them for testing. Model hyperparameters will be systematically tuned using techniques like Bayesian optimization. Training will be conducted on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with GPUs.\n\n**Aim 3: Model Interpretation and Application to Disease.**\nA key advantage of our approach is the ability to interrogate the trained model to extract biological insights.\n*   **Interpretation of Cis-Trans Logic:** We will use feature attribution methods like Integrated Gradients or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand model decisions. These methods will allow us to score the importance of each nucleotide in the input sequence and each RBP in the expression vector for a given splicing prediction. To probe combinatorial control, we will perform large-scale in silico perturbation experiments. By systematically altering RBP expression levels in the input and observing the predicted change in PSI, we can map the functional regulatory network of the splicing code.\n*   **Variant and Disease Analysis:** We will apply the trained model to predict the functional impact of genetic variants. By comparing the predicted PSI for a reference allele versus an alternative allele, we can calculate a ΔPSI score to prioritize potentially pathogenic variants from databases like ClinVar. We will also apply the model to the TCGA dataset, using the cancer-specific RBP expression profiles to predict aberrant splicing patterns and identify key RBP drivers of oncogenic splicing programs.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Assemble working group; establish data processing pipelines; complete curation of GTEx and ENCODE data; develop and benchmark initial model prototypes. (Deliverable: Integrated GTEx dataset; prototype model code).\n*   **Year 2:** Finalize model architecture; complete large-scale model training and hyperparameter optimization; perform rigorous cross-validation and benchmarking; begin model interpretation and in silico perturbation analyses. (Deliverable: Trained model; initial interpretation results).\n*   **Year 3:** Apply the model to TCGA and ClinVar datasets; complete analysis of combinatorial RBP logic and disease-specific splicing; prepare manuscripts for publication; develop and launch a public web portal for model access; disseminate results through conferences and workshops. (Deliverable: Publications; public web portal; final open-source code and data release).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to make significant contributions to molecular biology, computational genetics, and precision medicine. By synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets through a novel, multidisciplinary approach, we will generate not only new knowledge but also powerful resources that will catalyze future research across the scientific community.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of the Splicing Code:** The primary outcome will be a state-of-the-art deep learning model, which we will name 'SpliceNet-Context' (SNC). Unlike existing tools, SNC will be the first model to integrate genomic sequence with the trans-acting RBP environment to predict quantitative splicing outcomes across dozens of human tissues and disease states. This model will represent a paradigm shift from static, sequence-based prediction to dynamic, context-aware modeling of a fundamental biological process.\n2.  **A Comprehensive Atlas of Splicing Regulation:** Through systematic interpretation of the trained model, we will produce a comprehensive atlas detailing the regulatory logic of the splicing code. This will include: (a) a refined catalog of cis-regulatory motifs and their positional dependencies; (b) a quantitative map of the impact of over 1,500 RBPs on thousands of splicing events; and (c) a network of functional RBP-RBP interactions (synergistic and antagonistic) that define tissue-specific splicing programs. This atlas will provide countless testable hypotheses for the broader RNA biology community.\n3.  **An Open-Access Suite of Resources:** In adherence with open science principles, all project outputs will be made publicly available. This includes the fully trained SNC model, all source code hosted on GitHub, all processed data tables deposited in Zenodo, and a user-friendly web portal. The web portal will allow researchers to submit a genomic variant or a gene of interest and receive predictions of splicing patterns across all modeled tissues, democratizing access to our complex model.\n\n**Broader Scientific Impact:**\nThis research will fundamentally advance our understanding of gene regulation as an emergent phenomenon. By demonstrating how simple components (sequence motifs, individual proteins) interact to produce complex, tissue-specific behavior, our work will provide a blueprint for systems-level analysis of other regulatory processes. It will transform the study of splicing from a gene-by-gene approach to a genome-wide, quantitative science. For the genetics community, SNC will be a powerful tool for interpreting the 98% of disease-associated variants that fall in non-coding regions, helping to bridge the gap between statistical association and biological mechanism. In the context of cancer biology, our analysis of TCGA data will uncover novel mechanisms of splicing dysregulation that contribute to tumorigenesis and may reveal new therapeutic vulnerabilities.\n\n**Dissemination and Training:**\nOur dissemination strategy is multifaceted. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals and present at leading international conferences (e.g., ISMB, RNA Society, ASHG). We will also organize a final workshop for the broader community to demonstrate the use of our tools and resources. This project is an exceptional training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs within the working group will receive unique cross-disciplinary training at the interface of wet-lab biology, big data analysis, and machine learning—a skill set in high demand. The collaborative nature of the project will foster a team science environment, preparing trainees for the future of biomedical research.\n\n**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**\nThe framework we develop is designed to be extensible. The SNC model can be readily updated as more RBP binding data or transcriptomic profiles become available. In the future, it can be expanded to incorporate additional data modalities, such as chromatin structure, DNA methylation, or RNA structure probing data, to build an even more holistic model of gene expression. The collaborative network established by this NCEMS working group will form a durable intellectual hub for data synthesis in RNA biology, positioning us to secure further funding (e.g., NIH R01s) to pursue these exciting future directions and ensure the long-term sustainability and impact of our work.",

        "background_and_significance": "The emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic ancestors stands as one of the most significant and transformative events in evolutionary history, paving the way for the entire diversity of multicellular life, including fungi, plants, and animals. This transition was characterized by a dramatic increase in cellular complexity, including the acquisition of the mitochondrion, the evolution of a dynamic endomembrane system and cytoskeleton, and the sequestration of the genome within a nucleus. Understanding the nature of the organism that stood at the precipice of this radiation—the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)—is a grand challenge in modern biology. Reconstructing LECA provides a critical anchor point for understanding the fundamental principles of eukaryotic cell biology and the evolutionary processes that generate organismal complexity. The current consensus, bolstered by the discovery of the Asgard superphylum of archaea, posits that eukaryotes arose from a symbiosis between an Asgard-like archaeal host and an alphaproteobacterium that became the mitochondrion. This 'two-domain' view of life provides a clear phylogenetic framework for tracing the origins of eukaryotic genes. However, the cellular and genomic state of LECA remains a subject of intense debate. Was LECA a simple 'proto-eukaryote' that only gradually accrued complexity in subsequent lineages, or was it already a highly complex cell, possessing the majority of molecular systems found in modern eukaryotes? Answering this question requires a detailed, data-driven reconstruction of LECA's 'parts list' and cellular organization. Previous efforts to reconstruct LECA have provided invaluable but incomplete insights. Early phylogenomic studies, often based on limited taxon sampling, inferred a core set of several thousand gene families present in LECA. More recent work has focused on reconstructing specific ancestral systems, such as the nuclear pore complex, the endomembrane trafficking machinery (e.g., ESCRTs, COPs), and the spliceosome. These studies have demonstrated the power of comparative genomics but have largely been conducted in isolation, leaving a critical gap in our understanding: the lack of an integrated, systems-level view of the LECA cell. We do not yet have a comprehensive picture of how these individual components were interconnected into functional networks and pathways, nor a complete understanding of the metabolic and physiological capabilities of this ancient organism. Furthermore, many reconstructions have been hampered by a historical reliance on a few model organisms (e.g., yeast, animals, plants), which represent only a tiny fraction of eukaryotic diversity. The vast majority of eukaryotes are microbial protists, and these lineages, many of which branch deep within the eukaryotic tree, are essential for accurately inferring ancestral states. The current moment is uniquely opportune for a definitive synthesis project. The past decade has witnessed an explosion in the availability of publicly accessible genomic and transcriptomic data from an unprecedented diversity of eukaryotic lineages, including crucial, understudied protists from projects like the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) and various single-cell genomics initiatives. Concurrently, advances in computational methods—including more sophisticated phylogenetic models, powerful orthology inference tools, and revolutionary protein structure prediction algorithms like AlphaFold—provide the necessary toolkit to analyze this data deluge. This project will leverage these converging advances to move beyond a simple gene list, aiming to reconstruct LECA as an integrated cellular system. By synthesizing phylogenomics, protein interaction data, and structural biology, we will build a multi-layered model of LECA, providing a foundational resource that will catalyze new research across cell biology, evolutionary biology, and synthetic biology for years to come.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project addresses the overarching question: What was the genomic, structural, and functional composition of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), and how did its hallmark features emerge from the integration of archaeal and bacterial components? To answer this, we have structured our research into three synergistic aims, each with specific questions and testable hypotheses. \n\n**Aim 1: A comprehensive phylogenomic analysis to infer the complete protein-coding gene repertoire of LECA.**\nThis aim seeks to generate the definitive 'parts list' of the ancestral eukaryotic cell.\n*   **Research Question 1.1:** What was the size and functional composition of the LECA proteome, and what does this imply about its cellular complexity?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** LECA already possessed a highly complex proteome, containing the core components of nearly all major eukaryotic molecular machines, making it qualitatively more similar to modern eukaryotes than to any prokaryote. We hypothesize that the major increase in complexity at the origin of eukaryotes was one of integration and regulation, not simply gene content.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** Our phylogenomic pipeline will infer a core set of approximately 4,000-6,000 protein families that trace back to the LECA node with high statistical support across multiple inference methods (e.g., parsimony, likelihood). Functional annotation of this set will reveal enrichment for hallmark eukaryotic processes like endomembrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and chromatin modification, validating the hypothesis of a complex ancestor.\n\n**Aim 2: An interaction-based reconstruction of LECA's ancestral molecular machines and organelles.**\nThis aim moves beyond a list of genes to understand how they were organized into functional modules.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** What was the subunit composition and interaction logic of key LECA molecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex (NPC), endomembrane coats (COPII, clathrin), and the proteasome?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** LECA's molecular machines were compositionally sophisticated, containing the core structural scaffolds found across modern eukaryotes, but lacked many of the lineage-specific peripheral and regulatory subunits that were added later. This implies a model of 'core complexity followed by peripheral elaboration'.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** By integrating our inferred LECA proteome with public protein-protein interaction (PPI) and structural data (e.g., AlphaFold DB), we will reconstruct ancestral interaction networks. We predict that these networks will reveal conserved cores for at least ten major complexes, shared across all eukaryotic supergroups. The validity of these reconstructed 'proto-complexes' will be tested by assessing the co-evolutionary signals (e.g., mirrored phylogenetic trees) of their constituent proteins and by comparing their predicted structures to known modern complexes.\n\n**Aim 3: A functional synthesis to model the physiology of LECA.**\nThis aim integrates the findings from Aims 1 and 2 to create a holistic model of the LECA cell in action.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** What were the core metabolic capabilities and regulatory networks of LECA, and how did they differ from its prokaryotic progenitors?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** LECA was an aerobic, heterotrophic phagotroph, whose metabolism was fully integrated with its proto-mitochondrion. It possessed a sophisticated ubiquitin-based signaling system that was central to regulating protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and membrane trafficking, representing a key eukaryotic innovation.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** Mapping the inferred LECA proteome onto metabolic databases (e.g., KEGG) will reveal complete pathways for oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle, alongside pathways for phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation. We will identify the core components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (E1, E2, E3 enzymes) and their predicted targets, validating the presence of this regulatory network. The resulting genome-scale metabolic model will be tested for its ability to sustain a viable metabolic flux in silico.\n\n**Expected Deliverables:** The primary deliverables will be: (1) A publicly accessible, annotated database of the inferred LECA proteome. (2) Reconstructed interaction networks and 3D structural models for key ancestral molecular machines. (3) A genome-scale metabolic model of LECA. These resources will provide an unparalleled foundation for future research into the principles of eukaryotic cell evolution.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a pure data synthesis effort that will integrate publicly available data using a novel, multi-layered computational pipeline. Our transdisciplinary team has the requisite expertise in phylogenomics, cell biology, structural modeling, and network analysis to execute this ambitious plan. The methodology is organized around our three research aims.\n\n**Data Sources and Curation:**\nOur foundation will be a meticulously curated dataset of genomes and proteomes. We will compile data from major public repositories including NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl Genomes, and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). A key feature of our approach is the emphasis on deep taxonomic sampling to break long branches and improve phylogenetic accuracy. We will specifically incorporate over 200 diverse protist lineages from sources like the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) and recent single-cell genomic surveys. This eukaryotic dataset of >300 species will be complemented by >1000 representative prokaryotic genomes, with a dense sampling of Asgard archaea and Alphaproteobacteria to serve as critical outgroups for rooting phylogenies. For Aims 2 and 3, we will integrate this genomic data with other data types: protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from STRING and BioGRID (using only high-confidence experimental interactions), protein structures from the PDB and AlphaFold DB, and functional annotations from Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, and InterPro.\n\n**Aim 1: Phylogenomic Reconstruction of the LECA Proteome:**\n1.  **Orthology Inference:** We will use OrthoFinder2, a highly accurate and scalable method, to cluster all proteins from our >1300 proteomes into orthologous groups (OGs).\n2.  **Phylogenetic Pipeline:** For each of the thousands of OGs, we will build a robust phylogeny. This involves a standardized pipeline: multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT (L-INS-i algorithm), automated alignment trimming with trimAl (gappyout method), and maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference with IQ-TREE2. The latter will use ModelFinder to select the best-fit substitution model and will assess branch support with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates.\n3.  **Ancestral State Reconstruction:** To infer the gene content of LECA, we will reconcile these individual gene trees with a consensus species tree. The species tree will be built independently from a concatenated alignment of ~200 conserved, single-copy marker proteins. We will use a suite of ancestral state reconstruction methods, including both parsimony (Dollo and Wagner) and probabilistic likelihood-based models (e.g., using the Count software). An OG will be considered a high-confidence LECA gene only if it is inferred as present by a consensus of these methods.\n4.  **Gene Provenance:** For each inferred LECA gene, its comprehensive phylogeny (including prokaryotic homologs) will be analyzed to determine its evolutionary origin: archaeal, bacterial, or a eukaryotic-specific innovation.\n\n**Aim 2: Interaction and Structural Reconstruction:**\n1.  **Interactome Inference:** We will map high-confidence PPIs from model organisms (e.g., human, yeast, Arabidopsis) onto our inferred LECA proteins using homology. An ancestral interaction will be inferred if orthologs of the interacting partners are found in LECA and the interaction is conserved across multiple eukaryotic supergroups. This 'phylogenetic profiling' of interactions minimizes false positives.\n2.  **Structural Modeling of Complexes:** We will leverage the revolutionary power of AlphaFold-Multimer. For high-priority ancestral complexes (e.g., the core scaffold of the NPC, the ESCRT-III membrane-remodeling machinery), we will use the inferred LECA protein sequences as input to predict the three-dimensional quaternary structure of the entire complex. These structural predictions provide an independent and powerful test of inferred protein interactions.\n3.  **Network Analysis:** The resulting LECA interactome will be modeled as a network graph. We will apply community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain modularity optimization) to identify densely interconnected modules, which represent the footprints of ancestral molecular machines and functional pathways.\n\n**Aim 3: Functional and Metabolic Synthesis:**\n1.  **Functional Annotation:** The LECA proteome will be functionally annotated using a battery of tools, including eggNOG-mapper for assignment to KEGG Orthology (KO) groups and InterProScan for domain and GO term mapping.\n2.  **Metabolic Network Reconstruction:** Using the KO annotations, we will reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of LECA with the KBase platform or the CarveMe tool. This model will mathematically represent all known metabolic reactions catalyzed by the LECA proteome.\n3.  **Flux Balance Analysis (FBA):** We will use FBA to simulate LECA's physiology in silico. This will allow us to test hypotheses about its metabolic capabilities, such as its ability to grow on different substrates or its reliance on oxygen for efficient energy production.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition and curation; completion of orthology inference and initial phylogenies; first annual working group meeting. **Milestone:** A version 1.0 inferred LECA proteome.\n*   **Year 2:** Refinement of phylogenomic analyses; reconstruction of ancestral interactome and structural models for 5 key complexes; functional annotation and metabolic model construction; training workshop for trainees. **Milestone:** Reconstructed models of the nuclear pore and endomembrane systems.\n*   **Year 3:** Integration of all data into a unified cellular model; in silico physiological simulations; manuscript preparation; public release of all data and tools via a dedicated project portal. **Milestone:** Public LECA resource portal and submission of synthesis manuscript.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will provide a transformative, systems-level understanding of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, yielding significant outcomes that will have a lasting impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Definitive, Community-Standard LECA Proteome:** The primary scientific outcome will be the most comprehensive and rigorously validated reconstruction of the LECA gene set to date. This 'LECA parts list,' annotated with functional information and evolutionary origins, will serve as a foundational reference for the entire field. It will replace older, less complete reconstructions and become the standard for any study investigating the deep evolution of eukaryotic gene families.\n2.  **The First Structural Models of Ancestral Molecular Machines:** By integrating phylogenetics with AlphaFold-Multimer, we will move beyond lists of components to generate the first plausible 3D structural models of key molecular machines as they existed over a billion years ago. This provides unprecedented mechanistic insight into how these complexes functioned and assembled, revealing the architectural principles of eukaryotic cellular organization.\n3.  **An Integrated Systems-Level Model of an Ancestral Cell:** Our final synthesis will be a holistic, multi-scale model of LECA, connecting its genome, proteome, interactome, and metabolome. This will be the most complete model of an ancestral organism ever created, providing a powerful in silico platform for generating and testing new hypotheses about the major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of the nucleus and the integration of the mitochondrion.\n4.  **A Novel and Reusable Methodological Framework:** The computational pipeline we develop for integrating phylogenomics, interactomics, and structural biology will be a significant methodological contribution. This open-source workflow will be adaptable for reconstructing other ancestral organisms or systems, providing a valuable resource for the broader evolutionary biology community.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Foundation for Understanding Human Disease:** Core cellular processes like cell division, DNA repair, and intracellular trafficking are deeply conserved from LECA to humans. Malfunctions in this machinery underlie cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders. By understanding the ancestral, core function of these systems, we can gain new perspectives on their roles in human health and disease.\n*   **Informing Synthetic Biology:** A detailed blueprint of a complex, viable ancestral cell can provide design principles for the field of synthetic biology. Understanding the minimal set of components required for key eukaryotic functions could guide efforts to engineer synthetic organelles or minimal eukaryotic chassis.\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdocs will gain hands-on experience at the cutting edge of computational biology, learning to manage large datasets, implement complex analytical pipelines, and work within a collaborative, multidisciplinary team. We will host an annual workshop to disseminate these skills more broadly.\n\n**Dissemination Plan and Open Science:**\nOur commitment to open science is central to this project's philosophy. \n*   **Publications:** We plan for 3-4 major publications in high-impact, open-access journals (e.g., *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, *eLife*, *Cell*), including separate papers for each major aim and a final synthesis paper.\n*   **Public Data Portal:** All data, results, and models will be made immediately available through a dedicated project website. This includes the inferred LECA proteome, downloadable network files, PDB files for structural models, and the metabolic model in SBML format. \n*   **Open Source Software:** All analysis scripts and pipelines will be version-controlled on GitHub and released under a permissive open-source license, ensuring full reproducibility and reusability.\n*   **Community Engagement:** We will present our findings at major international conferences (e.g., Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, American Society for Cell Biology) and will develop educational materials based on our LECA models for use in undergraduate and graduate curricula.",

The budget is designed to support a distributed working group of three Principal Investigators (PIs) and their trainees over a three-year period. As this project does not involve any wet-lab experiments, the costs are focused on personnel, computation, and travel to facilitate synergy and collaboration.\n\n**1. Personnel (Total: ~$600,000):**\nThis is the largest component of the budget, reflecting the person-hours required for data curation, analysis, and integration.\n*   **Postdoctoral Scholars (2):** We request full salary and benefits for two postdoctoral scholars for three years. One postdoc will specialize in phylogenomics and large-scale sequence analysis, while the second will focus on network analysis, structural modeling, and systems integration. They will be the primary drivers of the day-to-day research.\n*   **Graduate Students (3):** We request partial support (stipend, tuition, and fees) for three graduate students, one located at each PI's institution. They will lead specific sub-projects aligned with our core aims and will receive cross-disciplinary training.\n*   **PI Summer Salary:** We request one month of summer salary per year for each of the three PIs. This will provide protected time for project management, data analysis oversight, trainee mentoring, and manuscript preparation.\n\n**2. Travel (Total: ~$45,000):**\nEffective collaboration in a synthesis working group requires regular face-to-face interaction.\n*   **Annual Working Group Meetings:** Funds are requested for all 8-10 project members (PIs, postdocs, students) to convene for a 3-day intensive workshop each year.

        "background_and_significance": "The prevailing paradigm in cancer biology has shifted from a cancer-cell-centric model to one that recognizes tumors as complex, adaptive ecosystems. This ecosystem, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME), comprises a heterogeneous collection of cancer cells, immune cells (e.g., T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix components. The coordinated and often co-opted interactions between these cellular players are fundamental drivers of cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The collective behaviors of the tumor, such as sustained angiogenesis, localized immunosuppression, and invasion, are not properties of any single cell type but are emergent phenomena arising from a dense network of intercellular communication. Understanding the 'social network' of the TME is therefore a paramount challenge in modern oncology. \n\nThe advent of high-throughput single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has provided an unprecedented opportunity to deconstruct the TME at cellular resolution. Seminal studies have leveraged these technologies to create detailed cell atlases for various cancers, revealing previously unappreciated cellular heterogeneity and identifying novel cell subtypes. Building on this, a suite of computational tools has been developed to infer cell-cell communication (CCI) by mapping the expression of ligands in signaling cells to their cognate receptors in receiving cells. Tools like CellPhoneDB, NicheNet, and CellChat have enabled researchers to move beyond simple cell-type cataloging to creating static maps of potential interactions. These approaches have successfully identified critical communication axes in specific contexts, such as the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in immune checkpoint blockade or the role of specific CAF-cancer cell interactions in promoting invasion. \n\nDespite these advances, significant gaps in our knowledge persist, limiting the translational potential of this research. First, most CCI studies are confined to a single cancer type, a limited patient cohort, or a specific biological context. This fragmented approach prevents the identification of generalizable, pan-cancer principles of TME organization. We lack a unified framework to compare and contrast communication networks across different malignancies. Second, current analyses predominantly focus on cataloging pairwise ligand-receptor interactions. While informative, this reductionist view fails to capture the higher-order, systems-level properties of the TME network. The emergent logic of the tumor—how local interactions give rise to global, pro-tumorigenic functions—remains largely uncharacterized. We do not know which cell types act as critical 'hubs' controlling information flow, nor do we understand the recurrent circuit 'motifs' that stabilize the TME's malignant state. Finally, our understanding of TME network dynamics is nascent. How this complex communication web rewires in response to perturbations, particularly cancer therapies, is a critical unanswered question for overcoming treatment resistance. \n\nThis research is both important and timely. The recent explosion of publicly available data from large-scale consortia, including the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), has created a critical mass of data that makes a large-scale synthesis project feasible for the first time. This proposal directly addresses the research call's focus on synthesizing public data to understand emergence phenomena in cellular biosciences. By integrating these vast datasets, our working group will construct the first pan-cancer atlas of TME communication networks. This project will move beyond simple interaction maps to a systems-level analysis, applying principles from network theory to uncover the fundamental organizational logic of the TME. Such an understanding is essential for designing the next generation of cancer therapies, which will likely require rationally designed combination strategies that disrupt the very communication networks that enable tumors to thrive.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research proposal is structured around three primary aims, each designed to deconstruct the TME communication network from a different perspective—from identifying its key players to understanding its recurrent circuits and its dynamic response to therapy. Each aim is driven by specific research questions and testable hypotheses.\n\n**Aim 1: Identify key communication hubs and keystone cell types that disproportionately control information flow in the TME.**\nThis aim seeks to move beyond a simple census of cell types to a functional understanding of their roles within the TME's information architecture. We will identify the cellular players that are most critical for maintaining network integrity and function.\n*   **Research Question 1.1:** Across diverse human cancers, are there conserved cell types or functional cell states that consistently act as central communication hubs?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that specific subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), rather than cancer cells themselves, will consistently emerge as the TME's 'keystone' communicators. These cell types will exhibit high network centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness), acting as critical bridges for signaling between cancer, immune, and stromal compartments, thereby orchestrating a pro-tumorigenic environment.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will construct communication networks for thousands of individual tumor samples. Using network analysis algorithms, we will calculate centrality metrics for every cell type in each sample. We will then test for cell types whose centrality scores are consistently and significantly higher than others across a pan-cancer cohort. We will validate this *in silico* by simulating the removal of these hub nodes and measuring the resulting disruption to network connectivity.\n*   **Research Question 1.2:** Is the network centrality of specific cell populations correlated with clinical outcomes, such as patient survival, tumor grade, or metastatic potential?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that higher network centrality of immunosuppressive cell types (e.g., M2-like TAMs, regulatory T cells) and lower centrality of effector immune cells (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes) will be significantly associated with poorer overall survival and more advanced disease stage.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate our network metrics with the rich clinical metadata available from sources like TCGA. We will use survival analysis models (e.g., Cox proportional hazards) to test for significant associations between cell-type centrality and patient outcomes, controlling for confounding variables like tumor type and stage.\n\n**Aim 2: Characterize recurrent communication motifs and feedback loops that stabilize pro-tumorigenic states.**\nThis aim focuses on identifying higher-order circuit patterns, or 'motifs', that represent common functional modules used by tumors to sustain growth and evade the immune system.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** What are the most prevalent multi-cellular communication circuits that are statistically enriched in tumor tissues compared to matched normal adjacent tissues?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize the existence of conserved, pro-tumorigenic motifs. For example, we predict the frequent occurrence of a 'mutual support loop' where cancer cells secrete CSF1 to promote the survival and M2-polarization of macrophages, which in turn secrete growth factors like EGF to stimulate cancer cell proliferation.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will apply motif-finding algorithms to our TME networks to identify over-represented three- and four-node subgraphs. The statistical significance of these motifs will be rigorously assessed by comparing their frequency to that in a large ensemble of randomized networks that preserve basic properties like node degree.\n\n**Aim 3: Determine how the TME communication network rewires in response to therapies, particularly immunotherapy.**\nThis aim investigates the dynamics of the TME network, seeking to understand how it adapts to therapeutic pressure and why some tumors respond while others are resistant.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** How do the global topology and specific pathway activities of the TME communication network differ between tumors that respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and those that do not?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that in ICI responders, the TME network undergoes a large-scale state transition, rewiring from an immunosuppressive to an inflamed topology. This will be characterized by a marked increase in the strength and diversity of communication pathways originating from CD8+ T cells and helper T cells, and a collapse in the centrality of immunosuppressive populations. Conversely, non-responder networks will exhibit resilience, maintaining their baseline suppressive architecture or reinforcing alternative escape pathways.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will analyze public single-cell datasets from pre- and on-treatment biopsies of patients treated with ICIs. We will perform differential network analysis to identify statistically significant changes in network properties (global metrics, node centrality, and individual edge weights) between responder and non-responder cohorts. This will pinpoint the specific communication pathways associated with successful therapeutic response.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that relies exclusively on the integration and analysis of publicly available data. Our methodology is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and scalable, organized into a three-stage analytical pipeline.\n\n**1. Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonization**\nThis foundational stage ensures that data from disparate sources are processed into a consistent, analysis-ready format. This task is a primary justification for a collaborative working group, as it requires significant domain expertise and computational resources.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically aggregate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets from major public repositories. Key sources include: \n    *   **Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN):** Provides high-quality, multi-modal data across a wide range of cancers, serving as a core resource.\n    *   **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):** While primarily bulk data, we will leverage its unparalleled clinical and genomic metadata for correlation studies and utilize the growing number of associated single-cell datasets.\n    *   **Public Repositories (GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress):** We will conduct a comprehensive literature and database search to identify all relevant datasets, with a particular focus on studies with pre- and post-treatment samples for Aim 3.\n*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** To overcome technical variability between studies, we will develop and implement a standardized bioinformatic pipeline. This pipeline, containerized using Docker for reproducibility, will perform: \n    1.  **Uniform Raw Data Processing:** Raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) will be processed through a single workflow (e.g., Cell Ranger) to generate gene expression count matrices.\n    2.  **Quality Control and Normalization:** Rigorous QC will be applied to filter low-quality cells and genes. Data will be normalized using methods like SCTransform in Seurat to stabilize variance and remove technical artifacts.\n    3.  **Batch Correction:** To enable cross-dataset integration, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms like Harmony or Seurat's reference-based integration.\n    4.  **Standardized Cell Type Annotation:** We will create a consistent, multi-level cell ontology. Annotation will be performed using a hybrid approach, combining automated reference-based methods (e.g., Azimuth, SingleR) with manual curation based on canonical marker gene expression, ensuring high accuracy across all datasets.\n\n**2. Network Inference and Analysis**\nThis stage forms the analytical core of the project, transforming processed data into communication networks and interrogating their structure.\n*   **Cell-Cell Communication (CCI) Inference:** For each tumor sample, we will infer a weighted, directed network of intercellular communication. To ensure robustness, we will use a consensus approach led by CellChat, a powerful tool that models CCI by considering the stoichiometry of multi-subunit ligand-receptor complexes. We will supplement this with insights from NicheNet, which links communication signals to downstream gene expression changes in the receiving cell. The output will be an adjacency matrix for each sample, where nodes are cell types/subtypes and edges are weighted by the inferred communication probability for specific ligand-receptor pairs.\n*   **Network Analysis (Aims 1 & 2):** We will use graph theory libraries (e.g., `igraph`, `NetworkX`) to analyze the inferred networks.\n    *   **Hub and Keystone Identification (Aim 1):** We will calculate a suite of centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) for each cell type node across thousands of samples. A composite centrality score will be used to rank cell types and identify those that consistently function as pan-cancer hubs. We will correlate these centrality scores with clinical variables using mixed-effects models to account for study-specific variation.\n    *   **Motif Discovery (Aim 2):** We will employ specialized algorithms to search for statistically over-represented network motifs (e.g., feedback and feed-forward loops) of 3 and 4 nodes. The significance of each motif will be determined by comparing its frequency in the real TME networks to its frequency in an ensemble of thousands of degree-preserved randomized networks.\n*   **Differential Network Analysis (Aim 3):** To understand network rewiring, we will compare networks across different conditions (e.g., ICI responder vs. non-responder; tumor vs. normal). We will identify statistically significant differences in global network properties (e.g., density, modularity), node-level centrality, and the weights of individual communication pathways (edges). This will pinpoint the specific signaling axes that are gained or lost during therapeutic response.\n\n**3. Timeline and Milestones**\n*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12): Pipeline Development and Data Aggregation.**\n    *   **Milestones:** Assemble and curate datasets for at least 10 major cancer types. Finalize, benchmark, and publish the open-source data harmonization and network inference pipeline.\n    *   **Deliverable:** A containerized, reproducible workflow for generating TME communication networks from raw scRNA-seq data.\n*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24): Pan-Cancer Static Network Analysis.**\n    *   **Milestones:** Complete the pan-cancer analysis for Aims 1 and 2. Identify conserved network hubs and recurrent communication motifs. Draft and submit the first major manuscript describing the TME communication atlas.\n    *   **Deliverable:** A comprehensive, static atlas of TME communication networks and their core organizational principles.\n*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36): Dynamic Network Analysis and Public Resource Deployment.**\n    *   **Milestones:** Complete the differential network analysis for Aim 3. Develop and deploy the interactive web portal. Submit the second major manuscript on network rewiring. Formulate plans for long-term sustainability of the resource.\n    *   **Deliverable:** The public, interactive 'TME Social Network Atlas' web portal, enabling community-wide data exploration.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to produce a transformative set of resources, insights, and hypotheses that will significantly advance the fields of cancer biology, immunology, and systems medicine. The impact will be felt across basic, translational, and computational research communities.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n1.  **A Foundational, Pan-Cancer TME Communication Atlas:** The primary tangible outcome will be a comprehensive, multi-cancer atlas of intercellular communication networks. This will be the first resource of its kind, moving beyond single-study analyses to a unified, integrated view of TME organization. This atlas will be made publicly available through an intuitive, interactive web portal, allowing researchers worldwide to explore and visualize communication patterns, query specific ligand-receptor pairs, and compare network structures across different cancer types and cellular contexts.\n2.  **Discovery of Fundamental Principles of TME Organization:** By applying network theory to this vast dataset, we expect to uncover novel, generalizable principles of TME self-organization. This includes the identification of 'keystone' cell types that act as master regulators of the TME's functional state (Aim 1) and the characterization of recurrent communication 'motifs' that represent conserved, stabilizing circuits driving pro-tumorigenic behavior (Aim 2). These findings will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how collective tumor properties emerge from local cell interactions.\n3.  **Actionable Hypotheses for Novel Combination Therapies:** Our analysis will generate a wealth of specific, data-driven hypotheses for therapeutic intervention. By identifying the critical communication hubs and feedback loops that sustain tumors, we can propose rational strategies to disrupt them. For example, the analysis of network rewiring in response to immunotherapy (Aim 3) will reveal the communication pathways associated with resistance, suggesting novel co-targets to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. These hypotheses will provide a strong foundation for follow-up experimental validation by the broader research community.\n\n**Broader Impact and Alignment with Research Call**\nThis project is perfectly aligned with the funding organization's mission. It is a community-scale synthesis project that leverages existing public data to address a fundamental question of emergence in molecular and cellular biosciences. The transdisciplinary working group, comprising experts in cancer immunology, systems biology, and computational science, is essential for tackling a problem of this scale and complexity, which is far beyond the capacity of any single research lab.\n*   **Advancing Cancer Research:** The atlas will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine, democratizing access to complex systems-level analyses and accelerating the pace of discovery for countless individual research labs.\n*   **Informing Precision Medicine:** The network signatures we identify as being associated with clinical outcomes or therapy response could be developed into novel, systems-level biomarkers. A 'network biomarker' that captures the functional state of the TME may prove more predictive and robust than traditional single-gene or protein markers.\n*   **Training the Next Generation:** As mandated by the research call, this project provides an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be deeply embedded in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary team, gaining invaluable skills in data science, network biology, and cancer systems biology—a critical skillset for the future biomedical workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science Plan**\nWe are fully committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science.\n*   **Publications:** We anticipate at least two high-impact, peer-reviewed publications detailing the atlas and our findings on network dynamics.\n*   **Open-Access Portal:** The primary mode of dissemination will be the public web portal, ensuring broad and sustained access to the data and visualizations.\n*   **Open Code and Data:** All analysis code will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. The computational pipeline will be distributed as a Docker container. All derived data products, such as the network graph files, will be deposited in open repositories like Zenodo with a persistent DOI.\n*   **Community Engagement:** We will present our findings at major international conferences (e.g., AACR, SITC, ISCB) and conduct workshops to train researchers in using our portal and analysis tools, fostering a collaborative community around this resource.",
