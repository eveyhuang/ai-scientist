        "background_and_significance": "The complexity of cancer biology is underscored by the heterogeneity observed within tumor populations. Traditional bulk RNA sequencing methods provide an average expression profile of a tumor sample, which can obscure critical subclonal variations that drive tumor evolution and drug resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented resolution to capture the transcriptomic diversity at the single-cell level, enabling the identification of rare cell states and subclonal populations. However, despite the wealth of scRNA-seq data generated across various cancer types, there remains a gap in synthesizing these datasets to derive comprehensive insights into the heterogeneity of tumor cells. This gap is particularly significant given the rapid accumulation of scRNA-seq data and the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Our project aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing large-scale scRNA-seq datasets from multiple cancer types, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for understanding tumor heterogeneity.

However, despite extensive research, many key aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood. For instance, while numerous studies have reported altered microbial communities in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, the functional implications of these alterations are still under investigation. Similarly, while there is increasing evidence linking the microbiome to immune responses, the mechanistic details of these interactions are far from clear. These gaps in our understanding highlight the need for a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary approach to unravel the complex relationships between the host and its microbiome in chronic inflammatory diseases.

        "abstract": "This initiative will synthesize single-cell RNA sequencing data from tumor microenvironments to understand the dynamics of immune cell populations. By integrating scRNA-seq data from multiple tumors and conditions, we aim to identify key immune cell subsets and their roles in tumor suppression or promotion. The project will involve immunologists, oncologists, and bioinformaticians to develop innovative analytical tools. NCEMS support will be essential for managing and analyzing large-scale datasets. Results will be shared openly, and findings will be published in open-access journals. Trainees will gain experience in interdisciplinary research and learn state-of-the-art methods in single-cell analysis.",
        "background_and_significance": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem where various cell types interact to influence tumor progression. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled the detailed profiling of individual cells within TMEs, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and functional states. However, despite these technological advancements, a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between immune cells and tumor cells remains elusive. Current studies often focus on single datasets or specific cell types, limiting our ability to draw broad conclusions about the overall TME dynamics. Moreover, the lack of standardized analytical tools hampers the integration of diverse datasets, further impeding progress. This project aims to address these gaps by synthesizing publicly available scRNA-seq data from multiple tumors and conditions to identify key immune cell subsets and their roles in tumor suppression or promotion. This work is timely given the increasing availability of scRNA-seq data and the growing recognition of the importance of the TME in cancer biology. By bringing together experts from immunology, oncology, and bioinformatics, we can leverage diverse perspectives and expertise to develop innovative analytical strategies and gain deeper insights into TME dynamics.",

We hypothesize that specific immune cell subsets play critical roles in tumor suppression through mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, and modulation of the TME. Conversely, we predict that certain immune cell subsets promote tumor growth through immunosuppressive activities. To test these hypotheses, we will identify and characterize distinct immune cell populations using clustering algorithms and gene expression signatures. We expect to discover novel immune cell subsets and their functions in the TME, which could lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

        "background_and_significance": "The field of epigenetics has seen remarkable advancements over the past decades, revealing how gene expression can be regulated without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) refers to the transmission of epigenetic marks across generations, which can influence phenotype without changes to the genome itself. While TEI has been observed in various organisms, including plants, animals, and even humans, our understanding of its mechanisms and implications remains limited. Current studies often focus on single species or specific environmental conditions, leading to fragmented and incomplete knowledge. For instance, while numerous studies have demonstrated TEI in Arabidopsis thaliana, the mechanisms and heritability of these epigenetic marks across multiple generations are still under investigation. Similarly, in mammals, the role of TEI in complex traits such as disease susceptibility and behavioral phenotypes is an emerging area of research but lacks a comprehensive framework. These gaps highlight the need for a systematic and interdisciplinary approach to synthesize existing data and uncover common patterns and mechanisms of TEI across diverse species. This project aims to fill these knowledge gaps by integrating epigenetic data from multiple species, thereby providing a more holistic view of TEI and its potential biological significance. Given the rapid accumulation of epigenetic data, now is an opportune time to leverage these resources to address fundamental questions in molecular and cellular biology.

Data curation will involve identifying and selecting high-quality datasets from reputable repositories, such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) databases. Normalization will be performed using standardized methods to ensure consistency across datasets. Integration will involve combining the curated and normalized datasets into a unified framework for analysis. Computational approaches will include pathway enrichment analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning algorithms to identify key bacterial species and metabolites that influence brain function. Specifically, we will use differential expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in response to alterations in gut microbiota composition. Pathway enrichment analysis will help us understand the biological processes and signaling pathways affected by these changes. Correlation analysis will be used to identify associations between gut microbiota composition, fecal metabolites, and host transcriptomic profiles. Machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and support vector machines, will be employed to build predictive models that link gut microbiota to brain function. In addition, we will perform in vitro experiments to validate the predicted associations and in vivo experiments to assess the impact of specific gut microbiota compositions on brain function. These experiments will involve culturing gut microbiota in vitro and analyzing the effects on neuronal cell cultures. In vivo experiments will include gnotobiotic mouse models to study the impact of specific gut microbiota compositions on behavior and brain function. The project will be divided into several phases, each with specific deliverables and milestones. Phase 1 will focus on data curation and normalization, with completion expected within 3 months. Phase 2 will involve data integration and preliminary analysis, with completion expected within 6 months. Phase 3 will involve detailed analysis using computational and experimental approaches, with completion expected within 12 months. Phase 4 will involve validation of the predicted associations and building of predictive models, with completion expected within 18 months. Statistical analysis plans will be developed for each phase, ensuring rigorous evaluation of the data. The project timeline is as follows: Data curation and normalization (3 months), Data integration and preliminary analysis (6 months), Detailed analysis and model development (12 months), Validation and model refinement (18 months).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "The expected outcomes of this project include a comprehensive database of gut microbiome and host transcriptomic data, along with integrative models that link gut microbiota to brain function.
