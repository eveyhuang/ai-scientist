          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have emerged as fundamental organizing principles in cellular biology, yet the sequence-to-function rules governing their formation remain poorly understood. This synthesis project will integrate publicly available proteomics, transcriptomics, structural databases (PDB, AlphaFold), and high-throughput LLPS screening data to develop a comprehensive predictive framework for phase separation behavior. By combining expertise from biophysics, computational biology, cell biology, and machine learning, we will analyze thousands of proteins across diverse organisms to identify conserved sequence features, post-translational modifications, and structural motifs that drive condensate formation. The project will synthesize data from DisProt, PhaSePro, LLPSDB, and recent proteome-wide studies to map the phase separation landscape across the tree of life. We will develop open-source machine learning models to predict LLPS propensity and validate predictions against existing experimental datasets. This work addresses the fundamental question of how cells evolved to use phase separation as a regulatory mechanism and will provide tools for understanding disease-associated mutations in condensate-forming proteins. The collaborative nature of this project requires integration of disparate data types, advanced computational infrastructure, and expertise spanning multiple disciplines—capabilities that exceed individual laboratories. Deliverables will include a comprehensive phase separation atlas, predictive algorithms with public web interfaces, standardized analysis workflows, and training modules for graduate students in integrative data science approaches to molecular biology."

          "abstract": "Understanding how modern cellular metabolism emerged from prebiotic chemistry represents one of biology's most fundamental puzzles. This synthesis project will integrate metabolomics databases (KEGG, MetaCyc, HMDB), genomic data across all domains of life, geochemical datasets, and prebiotic chemistry literature to reconstruct plausible evolutionary pathways of metabolic network assembly. By bringing together systems biologists, evolutionary biochemists, geochemists, and network theorists, we will analyze the distribution of metabolic pathways across phylogenetic space to identify ancient core reactions and trace their elaboration into complex networks. The project will synthesize data from thousands of sequenced genomes, experimental studies of enzyme promiscuity, and computational models of prebiotic reaction networks to test competing hypotheses about metabolic origins (RNA world, metabolism-first, iron-sulfur world). We will employ graph theory, phylogenetic reconstruction, and constraint-based modeling to identify metabolic modules that could have functioned in early cells and map their expansion through gene duplication, horizontal transfer, and pathway fusion. This work will address whether metabolism evolved through continuous elaboration or punctuated innovation and identify chemical constraints that shaped biochemical evolution. The synthesis requires integration of geological, chemical, and biological data at scales impossible for single laboratories, along with development of novel analytical frameworks. Outputs will include an evolutionary metabolic atlas, open-source reconstruction tools, curated databases of ancient enzyme families, and interdisciplinary training programs bridging chemistry, biology, and computational sciences."

          "abstract": "While RNA structure is fundamental to gene regulation, most transcriptome-wide structural information remains unexplored. This synthesis project will integrate publicly available RNA structure probing data (DMS-seq, SHAPE-seq, icSHAPE), evolutionary conservation data, ribosome profiling datasets, and RNA-binding protein interaction maps to systematically identify functional RNA structural elements across human and model organism transcriptomes. By assembling experts in RNA biology, structural bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and machine learning, we will analyze thousands of datasets to discover conserved structural motifs that regulate translation, localization, and stability. The project will synthesize data from ENCODE, GTEx, modENCODE, and specialized RNA structure databases to build comprehensive structure-function maps. We will develop algorithms to distinguish functional structures from neutral folding, identify structure-disrupting disease mutations, and predict how RNA modifications alter structural landscapes. This addresses the fundamental question of how much gene regulation occurs through RNA structure versus sequence alone. The collaborative framework is essential because it requires integration of chemical probing data, high-throughput sequencing, structural prediction algorithms, and functional genomics—expertise rarely combined in single laboratories. The project will produce a public RNA structure atlas, validated structural motif libraries, prediction tools for identifying regulatory structures, and training workshops in integrative RNA biology. This resource will transform understanding of post-transcriptional regulation and provide new therapeutic targets for RNA-based diseases."

          "abstract": "Cells exist in a vast landscape of possible states, yet we lack a comprehensive framework for understanding the rules governing state transitions and the boundaries between cell types. This synthesis project will integrate single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, and lineage tracing data from hundreds of public datasets to construct a unified map of cellular state space across development, homeostasis, and disease. By combining expertise from developmental biology, computational biology, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning, we will analyze millions of single-cell profiles to identify attractor states, transition trajectories, and the regulatory networks that maintain or destabilize cell identity. The project will synthesize data from the Human Cell Atlas, ENCODE, developmental atlases across model organisms, and cancer cell line databases to address fundamental questions: What defines the boundaries between cell types? Are there universal principles governing cell state transitions? How do cells navigate state space during reprogramming or transformation? We will develop mathematical frameworks based on landscape theory and apply topological data analysis to map the geometry of cellular state space. This requires integration of multi-modal single-cell data, sophisticated computational infrastructure, and diverse theoretical perspectives beyond single-lab capabilities. Deliverables include an interactive cellular state atlas, open-source tools for trajectory inference and state prediction, standardized workflows for multi-modal data integration, and training programs in quantitative cell biology that will prepare the next generation of data-savvy researchers."

          "abstract": "Current protein interaction networks capture primarily stable complexes, missing the transient and weak interactions that constitute the majority of cellular regulatory events. This synthesis project will integrate diverse interaction datasets (AP-MS, Y2H, proximity labeling, crosslinking MS, structural predictions from AlphaFold-Multimer) with functional genomics, phosphoproteomics, and cellular localization data to construct comprehensive context-dependent interaction networks. By uniting structural biologists, systems biologists, biophysicists, and network scientists, we will develop methods to predict transient interactions, identify their regulatory contexts, and understand their functional consequences. The project will synthesize data from BioGRID, STRING, IntAct, and recent proteome-wide studies across multiple organisms to address how cells use weak interactions for signal processing and regulation. We will apply machine learning to distinguish functional transient interactions from non-specific binding, integrate structural data to understand interaction interfaces, and map how post-translational modifications modulate interaction dynamics. This addresses the fundamental gap in understanding cellular regulation beyond stable protein complexes. The synthesis requires integration of orthogonal experimental approaches, structural modeling at proteome scale, and network analysis tools that exceed individual laboratory capabilities. Outputs will include a dynamic interaction atlas with confidence scores and context annotations, predictive algorithms for transient interactions, standardized data integration pipelines, and interdisciplinary training modules. This resource will reveal hidden regulatory layers and provide new frameworks for understanding cellular decision-making."

          "abstract": "Mitochondria retain their own genomes that must coordinate with nuclear-encoded components, yet the principles governing mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution remain poorly understood despite their importance for fitness, speciation, and disease. This synthesis project will integrate mitochondrial and nuclear genome sequences from thousands of species, gene expression data, protein interaction networks, and population genomics datasets to understand how these two genomes maintain compatibility across evolutionary time. By bringing together evolutionary biologists, mitochondrial biologists, population geneticists, and systems biologists, we will analyze patterns of compensatory evolution, identify genes under coordinated selection, and determine how mitonuclear interactions constrain evolutionary trajectories. The project will synthesize data from GenBank, 1000 Genomes, population genomics databases, and mitochondrial disease repositories to test hypotheses about coevolutionary dynamics. We will develop computational frameworks to detect compensatory mutations, analyze expression coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and identify mitonuclear incompatibilities that contribute to hybrid breakdown and disease. This addresses fundamental questions about organellar evolution, the maintenance of mitochondrial genomes, and the genetic basis of metabolic diseases. The synthesis requires integration of phylogenomics, functional data, and population-level variation across diverse taxa—a scope impossible for individual laboratories. Deliverables include a mitonuclear coevolution database, tools for predicting compatibility, analysis workflows for detecting compensatory evolution, and training programs bridging evolutionary biology and molecular genetics that will equip trainees with skills in integrative genomics."

This synthesis project will integrate protein structural databases (PDB, AlphaFold), molecular dynamics simulations, mutational scanning data, and functional assays to decode the principles of allosteric communication. By assembling structural biologists, biophysicists, computational chemists, and machine learning experts, we will analyze thousands of protein structures to identify conserved pathways for signal transmission and develop predictive models for allosteric effects. The project will synthesize experimental structures, computational predictions, deep mutational scanning datasets, and NMR dynamics data to map allosteric networks across protein fold families. We will apply network analysis, perturbation theory, and deep learning to identify residues critical for signal transmission and predict how mutations disrupt allostery in disease. This addresses the fundamental question of how proteins encode regulatory information in their structures beyond active sites. The collaborative framework is essential because it requires integration of structural data, dynamics simulations, experimental validation datasets, and advanced computational methods that span multiple disciplines. Outputs will include an allosteric pathway database, prediction tools for identifying allosteric sites and mutations, standardized analysis protocols, and training workshops in integrative structural biology.

This synthesis project will integrate Hi-C, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and genomic data from diverse eukaryotes—from protists to mammals—to understand how chromatin architecture evolved and identify conserved organizational principles. By uniting chromatin biologists, evolutionary biologists, computational biologists, and comparative genomicists, we will analyze 3D genome organization across phylogenetic space to determine which features are ancestral and which represent lineage-specific adaptations. The project will synthesize data from ENCODE, modENCODE, 4D Nucleome, and organism-specific databases to address fundamental questions: When did TADs, compartments, and loops evolve? How do different organisms achieve transcriptional regulation through chromatin? What constraints shape genome organization? We will develop comparative frameworks to align chromatin features across divergent genomes, identify conserved architectural proteins and their binding motifs, and correlate organizational changes with regulatory innovations. This requires integration of 3D genomics data, phylogenetic methods, and comparative analyses at scales beyond individual laboratories. Deliverables include a comparative chromatin architecture atlas, tools for cross-species chromatin analysis, curated datasets of orthologous regulatory elements, and interdisciplinary training programs.

This synthesis project will integrate time-series transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and single-cell data from circadian, cell cycle, and metabolic studies to construct a unified framework of cellular timekeeping. By bringing together chronobiologists, cell cycle biologists, systems biologists, and applied mathematicians, we will analyze oscillatory patterns across molecular layers to identify coupling mechanisms, hierarchical relationships, and emergent temporal organization. The project will synthesize data from CircaDB, Cyclebase, time-resolved omics studies, and single-cell temporal datasets to address how cells integrate multiple timing cues and maintain temporal coordination. We will develop mathematical models of coupled oscillators, apply signal processing techniques to identify phase relationships, and determine how perturbations propagate through temporal networks. This addresses fundamental questions about cellular time perception and coordination of complex processes. The synthesis requires integration of multi-omics time-series data, sophisticated mathematical modeling, and expertise spanning multiple biological timing systems—capabilities exceeding individual laboratories. Outputs will include a temporal coordination atlas, tools for analyzing coupled oscillators in biological data, standardized workflows for time-series integration, and training programs in quantitative temporal biology.

This synthesis project will integrate proteomics data on protein abundance and turnover, structural databases, chaperone interaction networks, aggregation propensity predictions, and stress response datasets to map the cellular protein folding landscape. By assembling protein biochemists, cell biologists, biophysicists, and computational biologists, we will analyze how cells maintain proteome integrity across conditions, organisms, and evolutionary time. The project will synthesize data from ProteomeXchange, aggregation databases, chaperone interaction studies, and thermal proteome profiling to address fundamental questions: What determines which proteins require chaperones? How do proteostasis networks evolve? Why do certain proteins aggregate in disease? We will develop predictive models for protein folding outcomes in cellular environments, identify vulnerable proteins prone to misfolding, and map how proteostasis capacity varies across cell types and conditions. This requires integration of structural predictions, interaction networks, abundance measurements, and functional data at proteome scale—beyond single-lab capabilities. Deliverables include a cellular proteostasis atlas, tools for predicting folding outcomes and aggregation risk in cellular context, standardized analysis pipelines, and interdisciplinary training programs bridging biochemistry and cell biology.
