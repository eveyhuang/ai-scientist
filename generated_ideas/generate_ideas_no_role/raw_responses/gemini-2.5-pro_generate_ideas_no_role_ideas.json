However, it is not a monolithic state; rather, it is a collection of heterogeneous phenotypes whose emergence is governed by a complex interplay between the initiating stressor, cell type, and tissue microenvironment. This working group will address a long-standing puzzle: what are the fundamental principles that determine the specific 'flavor' of senescence, particularly the composition of the pro-inflammatory Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)? We propose a community-scale synthesis project that integrates disparate, publicly available datasets to deconstruct the emergence of senescent heterogeneity. Our transdisciplinary team of cell biologists, bioinformaticians, systems biologists, and machine learning experts will collate and harmonize transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq), proteomic, and metabolomic data from hundreds of studies across diverse cell types, species, and senescence inducers (e.g., oncogenic, replicative, therapy-induced). By applying advanced network inference algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, we will build a multi-layered molecular atlas of senescence. This will allow us to move beyond cataloging differences to modeling how initial stress signals propagate through regulatory networks to establish stable, emergent senescent states. The project will develop a predictive model of SASP composition based on cellular context and stressor identity, identify core regulatory modules that act as master switches for different senescence programs, and create a publicly accessible, integrated data resource and analysis portal for the research community. This work will provide a systems-level understanding of a key biological process and has the potential to revolutionize the development of targeted senolytic therapies for a wide range of age-related diseases.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Deconstructing the Grammar of Cellular Organization: Predicting Membraneless Organelles through Synthesis of Biophysical and Systems Data\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The discovery that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives the formation of membraneless organelles has transformed our understanding of cellular compartmentalization. These biomolecular condensates are critical for diverse functions, and their dysregulation is linked to diseases like neurodegeneration and cancer. However, the 'rules' governing which biomolecules enter which condensate remain elusive. This project will tackle this fundamental question by synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets to uncover the emergent 'grammar' of LLPS. We will assemble a working group of biophysicists, polymer physicists, cell biologists, and computational scientists to integrate sequence-level data (protein disorder, charge, valency from UniProt/Pfam), structural data (PDB), protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction networks (BioGRID, STRING, RBPDB), and cellular localization data (Human Protein Atlas). Using a combination of machine learning and network theory, we will develop a predictive framework that maps molecular features to emergent phase behavior. The primary goals are: 1) To create a comprehensive, annotated 'condensatome' database by systematically mining existing literature and datasets. 2) To develop a machine learning model that predicts the LLPS propensity of any protein or RNA and its likely partitioning into specific condensates based on its intrinsic features and cellular context (e.g., co-expression of interaction partners). 3) To model how post-translational modifications and changing cellular conditions dynamically regulate the composition and material properties of these organelles. This project moves beyond the capabilities of any single lab by requiring the integration of petabyte-scale, heterogeneous data and expertise spanning from theoretical physics to cell biology. The resulting predictive models and open-access resources will empower researchers to understand how emergent biophysical principles orchestrate cellular function and dysfunction.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States: A Multi-Omic Network Approach to Identify Therapeutic Vulnerabilities\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, but its manifestation is highly heterogeneous, emerging from the complex interplay of oncogenic drivers, tissue of origin, and the tumor microenvironment. A systems-level understanding of how distinct metabolic phenotypes emerge is critical for developing effective therapies. This working group proposes to build a Pan-Cancer Atlas of Emergent Metabolic States by synthesizing the wealth of public multi-omic cancer data. Our team, comprising cancer biologists, metabolomics experts, systems biologists, and data scientists, will integrate genomic (TCGA, ICGC), transcriptomic, proteomic (CPTAC), and metabolomic (Metabolomics Workbench) data from thousands of tumor samples across dozens of cancer types. The core of our approach is to move beyond correlative studies and build predictive, context-specific network models. We will use advanced computational methods to construct integrated networks that link genetic alterations (mutations, CNVs) to downstream changes in gene expression, protein abundance, and ultimately, metabolic flux. By analyzing the topology and dynamics of these networks, we will address fundamental questions: How do different oncogenic mutations converge on similar emergent metabolic phenotypes? What are the key network nodes that mediate the transition to an anabolic state? Can we identify metabolic liabilities that are emergent properties of the network itself, rather than a single mutated enzyme? This project will produce a comprehensive, queryable map of cancer metabolism, identify high-confidence metabolic vulnerabilities common to diverse cancer types, and develop an open-source computational pipeline for multi-omic data integration and network analysis. This resource will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine for the cancer research community and guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Emergence of a Superorganism: Synthesizing Multi-Kingdom Data to Model Host-Microbiome Metabolic Networks\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The human gut is a complex ecosystem where host and microbial metabolisms are deeply intertwined, giving rise to an emergent 'superorganism' with profound implications for health and disease. Understanding this metabolic codependence requires integrating data across biological kingdoms at a scale unachievable by a single lab. This working group will bring together microbiologists, immunologists, nutrition scientists, and computational biologists to construct a comprehensive, predictive model of the host-microbiome metabolic network. We will synthesize three major types of public data: 1) Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from large-scale cohorts (e.g., Human Microbiome Project, American Gut Project) to define the microbial community's functional potential and activity. 2) Host tissue-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data (e.g., GTEx, Human Protein Atlas) to define the host's metabolic capacity. 3) Public metabolomic data from blood and stool to provide system-level metabolic readouts. Our central strategy involves reconstructing thousands of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for individual gut microbes and integrating them with a human gut epithelial cell model. This community-scale modeling will allow us to simulate how dietary inputs are processed and how metabolic cross-feeding between microbes and between the microbiome and the host gives rise to the systemic metabolite profile. We will use this framework to predict the production of key signaling molecules (e.g., SCFAs, secondary bile acids) from microbiome composition, identify keystone species whose metabolic functions are critical for network stability, and simulate the emergent systemic effects of perturbations like antibiotic treatment or dietary shifts. This project will provide a foundational, quantitative understanding of our metabolic symbiosis and create a powerful in silico platform for designing personalized nutritional and therapeutic interventions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Evolutionary Assembly of Molecular Machines: A Phylogenetic Synthesis of Structure, Interaction, and Genomic Data\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The cell is powered by intricate molecular machines—protein complexes like the ribosome, proteasome, and spliceosome—whose complexity arose over billions of years of evolution. How these multi-subunit assemblies emerged from simpler ancestral components is a fundamental, unanswered question in biology. This working group will address this by tracing the evolutionary trajectories of protein complex assembly through a massive synthesis of public data. Our team of evolutionary biologists, structural biologists, and bioinformaticians will integrate data from phylogenomics, structural biology (PDB), and protein-protein interaction databases (IntAct, BioGRID, CORUM) across the tree of life. Our approach is three-pronged: 1) We will use deep homology searches and phylogenetic profiling across thousands of genomes to determine the evolutionary age of every subunit in major eukaryotic protein complexes. 2) We will map this phylogenetic information onto experimentally determined interaction networks and 3D structures to reconstruct the step-wise addition of subunits over evolutionary time. 3) We will use ancestral sequence reconstruction and structural modeling to infer the properties of ancient sub-complexes. This will allow us to ask how the emergence of new subunits enabled novel functions and regulatory capacities. We aim to uncover general principles of molecular evolution, such as the role of gene duplication in sub-functionalization, the existence of conserved 'assembly kernels' around which complexes are built, and how interaction networks are rewired to create evolutionary novelty. This project will produce a 4D atlas of the evolution of cellular machinery, providing unprecedented insight into the emergence of biological complexity from simple ancestral parts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Mapping the Waddington Landscape: A Dynamical Systems Model of Cell Fate Decisions from Single-Cell Multi-Omic Data Synthesis\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Cellular differentiation, the process by which stem cells give rise to specialized cell types, is a classic example of emergence, where complex, stable phenotypes arise from underlying gene regulatory networks. Conrad Waddington's 'epigenetic landscape' metaphorically captures this process, but a quantitative, predictive model remains elusive. This working group will construct data-driven Waddington landscapes by synthesizing the explosion of public single-cell multi-omic data. Our team of developmental biologists, systems biologists, physicists, and machine learning experts will collate and integrate time-course single-cell datasets (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scNMT-seq) from major cell atlas initiatives (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, Fly Cell Atlas) covering key developmental and reprogramming systems. By applying novel computational methods derived from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics, we will move beyond simple trajectory inference. Our goal is to reconstruct the high-dimensional state space of the underlying gene regulatory network and the vector field that governs cell state transitions. This will allow us to: 1) Quantitatively map the landscape of cell fate decisions, identifying stable attractor states (cell types), saddle points (decision points), and the barriers between them. 2) Identify the key transcription factors and regulatory loops that shape the landscape's topology. 3) Model how stochastic gene expression at the single-cell level interacts with the deterministic landscape to produce robust yet plastic cell fate outcomes. This project will provide a powerful, generalizable framework for understanding how cellular identity emerges and is maintained, with profound implications for regenerative medicine, cancer biology, and our fundamental understanding of development.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Allosteric Interactome: Uncovering the Hidden Regulatory Network of the Cell through Co-evolutionary and Structural Data Synthesis\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Allostery—the process by which a binding event at one site on a protein affects a distant functional site—is a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation. While individual examples are well-studied, a systems-level map of the cell's 'allosteric interactome' is missing, hindering our ability to understand cellular signaling and discover new drug targets. This working group proposes to create this map by synthesizing diverse, large-scale public data. Our transdisciplinary team of structural biologists, computational biophysicists, and network biologists will integrate three key data types: 1) Protein sequence data for thousands of protein families to perform statistical coupling analysis (SCA), which identifies co-evolving residues that often form allosteric pathways. 2) Protein structure data from the PDB to build residue-residue interaction networks and analyze their dynamic properties. 3) Functional data from databases of mutations and enzyme kinetics (e.g., ClinVar, BRENDA) to validate predicted allosteric effects. By combining these data streams within a machine learning framework, we will develop a computational engine to predict, on a proteome-wide scale, the allosteric communication pathways within proteins and the specific residues that act as allosteric 'hubs'. This will allow us to address how emergent regulatory function arises from the physical architecture of proteins. The project will deliver a publicly accessible, searchable database of predicted allosteric sites and pathways across the human proteome. This resource will not only reveal thousands of previously unknown regulatory mechanisms but will also provide a blueprint for designing novel allosteric drugs that offer greater specificity and fewer side effects than traditional active-site inhibitors, opening a new frontier in pharmacology.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Decoding the Emergent Logic of the Splicing Code: A Deep Learning Approach to Integrate Genomic and RBP-Binding Data\",\n      \"abstract\": \"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs vastly expands the functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes and is tightly regulated across different cell types and developmental stages. The 'splicing code'—the set of rules by which cis-regulatory sequences and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) determine splicing outcomes—is extraordinarily complex and context-dependent. This working group will tackle the challenge of deciphering this emergent code through a large-scale synthesis of public functional genomics data. We will assemble a team of RNA biologists, computational geneticists, and machine learning specialists to integrate three massive datasets: 1) RNA-seq data from thousands of samples across diverse tissues and diseases (e.g., GTEx, TCGA, ENCODE) to provide quantitative measurements of splicing events. 2) RBP binding maps from eCLIP-seq experiments (ENCODE) to locate where regulatory proteins bind to RNA. 3) The underlying genomic sequence, which contains the cis-regulatory motifs. Our central strategy is to develop and train advanced deep learning models, such as hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural networks, that can learn the splicing code directly from this integrated data. The models will take genomic sequence and cell-type-specific RBP expression levels as input and predict splicing patterns as output. This will allow us to model how the combinatorial binding of multiple RBPs gives rise to a specific, quantitative splicing decision. We will use these models to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in non-coding regions, identify key RBPs that drive tissue-specific splicing programs, and understand how this regulatory layer is rewired in disease. This project will provide an unprecedented, quantitative understanding of a critical layer of gene regulation and create a powerful tool for interpreting personal genomes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Genesis of Eukaryotic Complexity: A Data-Driven Synthesis to Reconstruct the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The origin of the eukaryotic cell, with its nucleus, mitochondria, and complex endomembrane system, represents one of the most profound evolutionary transitions in the history of life. While we know this event involved a symbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium, the cellular and genomic makeup of the resulting organism—the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)—remains enigmatic. This working group will undertake a definitive, data-driven reconstruction of LECA by synthesizing the vast and growing body of public genomic, proteomic, and structural data from across the eukaryotic tree of life. Our team of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and phylogeneticists will leverage data from deeply-sampled eukaryotic lineages, including many understudied protists, which serve as crucial windows into early eukaryotic evolution. The project will involve three synergistic aims: 1) A comprehensive phylogenomic analysis to infer the complete protein-coding gene repertoire of LECA, distinguishing core ancestral functions from later additions. 2) An interaction-based reconstruction, integrating protein-protein interaction and structural data to infer the composition of LECA's ancestral molecular machines and organelles (e.g., the nuclear pore complex, endomembrane trafficking machinery). 3) A functional synthesis, mapping the inferred gene content onto metabolic and regulatory pathways to model the physiology of this ancient cell. By understanding LECA's parts list and how those parts were connected, we can model how hallmark eukaryotic features emerged from the integration of archaeal and bacterial components. This project will produce the most complete and robust model of LECA to date, providing a foundational resource for understanding the principles that govern the emergence of biological complexity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Social Network of Tumors: Mapping the Emergent Logic of Intercellular Communication in the Microenvironment\",\n      \"abstract\": \"A tumor is not a monolith of cancer cells but a complex, adaptive ecosystem where cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells communicate to create a tumor-promoting environment. The collective behavior of this system—immune evasion, angiogenesis, metastasis—is an emergent property of its underlying intercellular communication network. This working group will create a comprehensive atlas of this 'social network' by synthesizing public single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. Our team of cancer immunologists, systems biologists, and computational scientists will integrate data from large-scale initiatives like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and TCGA. Our core methodology will be to systematically infer cell-cell communication events by mapping the expression of ligands in signaling cells to their cognate receptors in receiving cells across millions of individual cells. By applying network theory to this vast communication graph, we will move beyond cataloging pairwise interactions to understanding system-level properties. We will identify: 1) Key communication hubs and keystone cell types that disproportionately control the information flow in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 2) Recurrent communication motifs and feedback loops that stabilize pro-tumorigenic states. 3) How the entire communication network rewires in response to therapies like immunotherapy. This project will produce a dynamic, multi-cancer atlas of TME communication, accessible through an interactive web portal. This resource will allow researchers to understand how collective behaviors emerge from local cell interactions and will provide a rational basis for designing novel combination therapies that disrupt the communication networks that allow tumors to thrive.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This project will provide an unprecedented, quantitative understanding of a critical layer of gene regulation and create a powerful tool for interpreting personal genomes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Genesis of Eukaryotic Complexity: A Data-Driven Synthesis to Reconstruct the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)\",\n      \"abstract\": \"The origin of the eukaryotic cell, with its nucleus, mitochondria, and complex endomembrane system, represents one of the most profound evolutionary transitions in the history of life. While we know this event involved a symbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium, the cellular and genomic makeup of the resulting organism—the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)—remains enigmatic. This working group will undertake a definitive, data-driven reconstruction of LECA by synthesizing the vast and growing body of public genomic, proteomic, and structural data from across the eukaryotic tree of life. Our team of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and phylogeneticists will leverage data from deeply-sampled eukaryotic lineages, including many understudied protists, which serve as crucial windows into early eukaryotic evolution. The project will involve three synergistic aims: 1) A comprehensive phylogenomic analysis to infer the complete protein-coding gene repertoire of LECA, distinguishing core ancestral functions from later additions. 2) An interaction-based reconstruction, integrating protein-protein interaction and structural data to infer the composition of LECA's ancestral molecular machines and organelles (e.g., the nuclear pore complex, endomembrane trafficking machinery). 3) A functional synthesis, mapping the inferred gene content onto metabolic and regulatory pathways to model the physiology of this ancient cell. By understanding LECA's parts list and how those parts were connected, we can model how hallmark eukaryotic features emerged from the integration of archaeal and bacterial components. This project will produce the most complete and robust model of LECA to date, providing a foundational resource for understanding the principles that govern the emergence of biological complexity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Social Network of Tumors: Mapping the Emergent Logic of Intercellular Communication in the Microenvironment\",\n      \"abstract\": \"A tumor is not a monolith of cancer cells but a complex, adaptive ecosystem where cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells communicate to create a tumor-promoting environment. The collective behavior of this system—immune evasion, angiogenesis, metastasis—is an emergent property of its underlying intercellular communication network. This working group will create a comprehensive atlas of this 'social network' by synthesizing public single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. Our team of cancer immunologists, systems biologists, and computational scientists will integrate data from large-scale initiatives like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and TCGA. Our core methodology will be to systematically infer cell-cell communication events by mapping the expression of ligands in signaling cells to their cognate receptors in receiving cells across millions of individual cells. By applying network theory to this vast communication graph, we will move beyond cataloging pairwise interactions to understanding system-level properties. We will identify: 1) Key communication hubs and keystone cell types that disproportionately control the information flow in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 2) Recurrent communication motifs and feedback loops that stabilize pro-tumorigenic states. 3) How the entire communication network rewires in response to therapies like immunotherapy. This project will produce a dynamic, multi-cancer atlas of TME communication, accessible through an interactive web portal. This resource will allow researchers to understand how collective behaviors emerge from local cell interactions and will provide a rational basis for designing novel combination therapies that disrupt the communication networks that allow tumors to thrive.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
