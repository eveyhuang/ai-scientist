The fundamental question addressed is: How do individual splicing decisions aggregate into emergent regulatory networks that enable cellular resilience under stress, such as in neurodegenerative disorders or environmental challenges? Unlike existing ideas that emphasize signaling pathways, epigenomics, or protein interactions, this project uniquely targets post-transcriptional modifications at the RNA level, synthesizing data across human tissues and model organisms to develop novel Bayesian inference models and graph-based algorithms for predicting isoform-driven emergence.\\n\\nThe collaboration brings together RNA biologists, statisticians, and machine learning experts from at least four labs spanning North America, Europe, and Asia, including early-career researchers from minority-serving institutions. This transdisciplinary effort is beyond single-lab scope due to the massive scale of isoform data and the need for specialized computational pipelines for cross-dataset harmonization. NCEMS support is essential for cloud-based data processing, virtual hackathons, and trainee mentorship programs, fostering inclusive partnerships and open science practices.\\n\\nKey activities include curating a comprehensive isoform database, applying stochastic modeling to identify emergent splicing motifs, and validating models against perturbation datasets. This will solve long-standing puzzles like the role of splicing in cellular memory and provide innovative tools for isoform network visualization. All synthesized data, code, and workflows will be shared via repositories like Figshare and GitLab, adhering to open science principles.

It supports community-scale synthesis and integration of existing molecular and cellular data to: Answer novel questions Solve long-standing puzzles in the molecular and cellular sciences Develop innovative research and analytical strategies Tap diverse new talent Train the future data-savvy workforce A community-scale synthesis project has three defining characteristics. First, it uses only existing publicly available data and often integrates distinct datasets together. It does not generate any new experimental data. Second, the project is beyond the capabilities of most individual research labs and instead requires collaboration between two or more labs. Finally, such a project requires diverse scientific perspectives and expertise to come together, often resulting in novel, deeper, and broader insights. You research should focus on well-defined scientific questions or methodological developments that advance molecular and cellular sciences through synthesis research to acquire insights from a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach. This RFP invites proposals for Working Groups that will: Address Compelling Scientific Questions: Tackle novel and significant research questions in molecular and cellular biology through data synthesis. Stimulate Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Bring together researchers from diverse fields. Utilize Publicly Available Data: Leverage existing data sources to develop innovative research and analytical strategies. Require NCEMS Support and Resources: The proposed synthesis project must demonstrate a clear need for NCEMS support that goes beyond the capabilities of a single lab or existing collaboration. Promote Collaborative Partnerships: Assemble teams that reflect a range of scientific expertise, geographic locations, career stages, and institutional research levels. Adhere to Open Science Principles: Commit to making findings, data, and analysis workflows publicly available in accordance with community-created policies on open, team, and reproducible science. Train the Next Generation: Provide training opportunities to trainees (graduate students and postdocs) through collaborative research efforts within the working group.",
