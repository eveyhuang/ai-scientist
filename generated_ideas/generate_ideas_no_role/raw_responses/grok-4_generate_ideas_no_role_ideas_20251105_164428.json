Emergence in this context refers to how complex cellular responses arise from interactions among signaling molecules, often leading to unexpected phenotypes in health and disease. The project addresses a fundamental question: How do perturbations in signaling pathways propagate to generate emergent cellular states, such as resistance to drugs or metastatic potential in cancer? By synthesizing data from diverse model organisms and human cell lines, we aim to develop novel analytical strategies, including machine learning-based network inference and dynamic modeling, to predict these emergent properties.\\n\\nThe collaboration involves experts from computational biology, systems biology, biochemistry, and data science across multiple institutions, including those from underrepresented regions and career stages. This transdisciplinary approach is essential, as no single lab possesses the breadth of expertise or computational resources to handle the scale of data integration required. We will leverage NCEMS support for virtual collaboration platforms, data curation workshops, and trainee involvement, fostering skills in open science and reproducible workflows.\\n\\nKey activities include curating a unified dataset of signaling perturbations, applying graph theory and AI to identify emergent motifs, and validating predictions against independent public datasets. The project will stimulate cross-disciplinary insights, such as linking molecular interactions to cellular decision-making processes. All findings, integrated datasets, and analysis pipelines will be shared via open repositories like GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles. Trainees will participate in hackathons and mentorship programs, training the next generation in data-savvy molecular sciences. This synthesis effort promises to solve long-standing puzzles in signal transduction, such as the origins of cellular heterogeneity, and pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.

It supports community-scale synthesis and integration of existing molecular and cellular data to: Answer novel questions Solve long-standing puzzles in the molecular and cellular sciences Develop innovative research and analytical strategies Tap diverse new talent Train the future data-savvy workforce A community-scale synthesis project has three defining characteristics. First, it uses only existing publicly available data and often integrates distinct datasets together. It does not generate any new experimental data. Second, the project is beyond the capabilities of most individual research labs and instead requires collaboration between two or more labs. Finally, such a project requires diverse scientific perspectives and expertise to come together, often resulting in novel, deeper, and broader insights. You research should focus on well-defined scientific questions or methodological developments that advance molecular and cellular sciences through synthesis research to acquire insights from a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach. This RFP invites proposals for Working Groups that will: Address Compelling Scientific Questions: Tackle novel and significant research questions in molecular and cellular biology through data synthesis. Stimulate Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Bring together researchers from diverse fields. Utilize Publicly Available Data: Leverage existing data sources to develop innovative research and analytical strategies. Require NCEMS Support and Resources: The proposed synthesis project must demonstrate a clear need for NCEMS support that goes beyond the capabilities of a single lab or existing collaboration. Promote Collaborative Partnerships: Assemble teams that reflect a range of scientific expertise, geographic locations, career stages, and institutional research levels. Adhere to Open Science Principles: Commit to making findings, data, and analysis workflows publicly available in accordance with community-created policies on open, team, and reproducible science. Train the Next Generation: Provide training opportunities to trainees (graduate students and postdocs) through collaborative research efforts within the working group.",
