Despite its importance, a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of the molecular principles governing entry into, maintenance of, and exit from quiescence is lacking. This project proposes to establish a multidisciplinary working group to synthesize the vast and growing body of publicly available multi-omics data related to quiescence. We will integrate transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic datasets from diverse biological contexts, including yeast, cultured mammalian cells, primary stem cells, and dormant tumor cells. The central hypothesis is that a conserved 'core quiescence program' exists across species and cell types, which is then tailored by context-specific regulatory modules. The working group, comprising experts in cell cycle biology, systems biology, computational modeling, and machine learning, will develop a novel analytical pipeline to normalize and integrate these heterogeneous datasets. Our primary goals are to: 1) Identify a robust, cross-species molecular signature of the core quiescence program; 2) Map the signaling pathways and metabolic shifts that are universally associated with the quiescent state; and 3) Build predictive models that can distinguish between different 'depths' of quiescence and predict a cell's potential to re-enter the cell cycle.

We will synthesize a diverse array of public data, including: 1) Protein sequence features from UniProt, focusing on intrinsically disordered regions and low-complexity domains; 2) Post-translational modification (PTM) data from repositories like PhosphoSitePlus, as PTMs are key regulators of LLPS; 3) Experimentally determined and predicted protein structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB) to understand how structure influences phase separation; 4) High-content imaging data from resources like the Image Data Resource to identify proteins that co-localize in cellular puncta; and 5) Protein-protein interaction and co-expression data to infer condensate partnerships. The core of the project is to develop a suite of machine learning models that can predict a protein's propensity to phase separate, its likely interaction partners within a condensate, and the PTMs that regulate its assembly/disassembly.

This requires a massive data synthesis effort far beyond the scope of any single lab. Our working group, composed of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, and computational scientists, will integrate data from hundreds of genomes and proteomes spanning all major eukaryotic supergroups (including under-sampled protist lineages), Asgard archaea (the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes), and other prokaryotes.

The working group, with expertise in cancer biology, metabolism, bioinformatics, and systems modeling, will develop a unified pipeline to process and integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data from over 20,000 tumor samples. Using this integrated dataset, we will employ genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs) and machine learning to: 1) Construct context-specific metabolic models for every major cancer subtype; 2) Identify a core set of metabolic reactions and pathways that are consistently dysregulated across most cancers, representing robust therapeutic targets; 3) Uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities that are linked to specific driver mutations or tissue-of-origin effects; and 4) Correlate metabolic phenotypes with clinical outcomes and drug response data.

It supports community-scale synthesis and integration of existing molecular and cellular data to: Answer novel questions Solve long-standing puzzles in the molecular and cellular sciences Develop innovative research and analytical strategies Tap diverse new talent Train the future data-savvy workforce A community-scale synthesis project has three defining characteristics. First, it uses only existing publicly available data and often integrates distinct datasets together. It does not generate any new experimental data. Second, the project is beyond the capabilities of most individual research labs and instead requires collaboration between two or more labs. Finally, such a project requires diverse scientific perspectives and expertise to come together, often resulting in novel, deeper, and broader insights. You research should focus on well-defined scientific questions or methodological developments that advance molecular and cellular sciences through synthesis research to acquire insights from a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach. This RFP invites proposals for Working Groups that will: Address Compelling Scientific Questions: Tackle novel and significant research questions in molecular and cellular biology through data synthesis. Stimulate Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Bring together researchers from diverse fields. Utilize Publicly Available Data: Leverage existing data sources to develop innovative research and analytical strategies. Require NCEMS Support and Resources: The proposed synthesis project must demonstrate a clear need for NCEMS support that goes beyond the capabilities of a single lab or existing collaboration. Promote Collaborative Partnerships: Assemble teams that reflect a range of scientific expertise, geographic locations, career stages, and institutional research levels. Adhere to Open Science Principles: Commit to making findings, data, and analysis workflows publicly available in accordance with community-created policies on open, team, and reproducible science. Train the Next Generation: Provide training opportunities to trainees (graduate students and postdocs) through collaborative research efforts within the working group.",
