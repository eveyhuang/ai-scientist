      "abstract": "A fundamental question in biology is how a single genome can give rise to hundreds of distinct, stable cell types. This emergent property, cellular identity, is encoded not just in the DNA sequence but in its dynamic, three-dimensional folding within the nucleus. We propose to create a 'Chromatin Compiler,' a predictive framework that synthesizes vast, publicly available datasets to understand how chromatin architecture dictates cell fate. This Working Group will integrate multi-modal data including Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and Micro-C from the 4D Nucleome portal to map genome topology; single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq from cell atlases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas) to link chromatin state to gene expression at cellular resolution; and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics for histone modifications and transcription factor binding. Our transdisciplinary team, comprising polymer physicists, computational biologists, developmental biologists, and machine learning experts, will develop novel graph-based neural networks and dynamical systems models. These models will aim to uncover the 'grammatical rules' governing how interactions between regulatory elements, topological associating domains (TADs), and nuclear compartments orchestrate complex gene expression programs during differentiation. The project's success will yield a powerful in silico tool to predict how perturbations to genome architecture—such as those caused by structural variants in cancer or developmental disorders—lead to aberrant cell identities. This work will provide unprecedented insight into the emergent logic of cellular programming and establish a new paradigm for studying genome function.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of biomolecular condensates, membraneless organelles formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), has revolutionized our understanding of cellular organization. These dynamic compartments emerge from multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, concentrating components to regulate key processes like transcription and stress response. However, the sequence-level rules governing which molecules enter which condensate, and how condensate properties yield specific functions, remain elusive. This Working Group will build a predictive atlas of the 'condensatome' by synthesizing disparate public data. We will integrate protein sequence and domain information (UniProt, Pfam), experimentally determined and predicted structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB), protein-protein interaction networks (STRING, BioGRID), and LLPS-specific databases (PhaSepDB, DrLLPS). Our team of biophysicists, protein biochemists, cell biologists, and AI specialists will employ advanced machine learning models, including large language models trained on protein sequences and graph neural networks on interaction data, to predict LLPS propensity and composition. We will correlate these predictions with cell-type-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data to understand how the cellular context modulates condensate formation. A key goal is to identify the 'emergent grammar' of LLPS and predict how mutations, suchas those found in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's, disrupt condensate dynamics and lead to pathological aggregation. This project will produce a publicly accessible, predictive platform that will transform our ability to understand and therapeutically target the emergent biology of cellular compartmentalization.",

      "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem where cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and other stromal cells engage in intricate metabolic cross-talk. Emergent properties of this system, such as profound immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance, are major barriers to effective cancer treatment. This Working Group aims to deconstruct this 'metabolic symphony' by building a spatially-resolved, multi-cellular model of TME metabolism. We will synthesize publicly available single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data (from TCGA, GEO, and specialized atlases), proteomics data, and public metabolomics datasets. Our collaborative team, uniting cancer biologists, immunologists, computational systems biologists, and spatial data scientists, will develop novel computational methods to integrate these data layers. We will use this integrated data to parameterize community-scale, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) that simulate nutrient competition and metabolite exchange between every cell type within a spatially-defined TME. The goal is to identify critical metabolic dependencies and feedback loops that drive emergent system-level behaviors. For example, how does lactate produced by glycolytic cancer cells reprogram macrophages to an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype? How do cancer-associated fibroblasts fuel tumor growth? By simulating metabolic perturbations, we will predict novel therapeutic strategies that disrupt these symbiotic interactions, aiming to break drug resistance and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. This synthesis project will provide a systems-level blueprint of TME metabolism, offering a powerful new lens through which to view and treat cancer.",

      "abstract": "Allostery, the process by which binding at one site on a protein affects a distant functional site, is a fundamental emergent property that enables complex biological regulation. While well-studied in individual proteins, a proteome-wide understanding of allosteric communication pathways is lacking. This Working Group will create a comprehensive, predictive map of allostery across the human proteome. We will synthesize a massive corpus of public data, including static protein structures (PDB), structural ensembles (NMR, cryo-EM), and predicted structures (AlphaFold DB); molecular dynamics simulation trajectories from repositories like MDTraj and MDsrv; and large-scale sequence data with evolutionary couplings (Pfam, EVcouplings). We will also integrate data on disease- and population-level mutations (ClinVar, gnomAD) to identify variants that likely function by disrupting allosteric regulation. Our team, composed of structural biologists, computational chemists, bioinformaticians, and machine learning experts, will develop a novel framework based on graph theory and geometric deep learning. This framework will model proteins as dynamic networks, identifying conserved pathways of communication ('allosteric wires') that are invisible to static structural analysis. The ultimate goal is to create a publicly accessible 'Allosterome Atlas' that allows researchers to query any protein and visualize its potential allosteric sites and communication pathways.

      "abstract": "Cellular signaling networks face a fundamental design challenge: they must be robust enough to buffer against noise and perturbations, yet plastic enough to adapt to new environmental cues. How these dual, seemingly contradictory, emergent properties arise from the underlying molecular interactions is a central puzzle in systems biology. This Working Group will address this question by synthesizing diverse, large-scale public datasets to uncover the general design principles of robust and plastic networks. We will integrate phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic time-series data following various perturbations (e.g., from LINCS, GEO), comprehensive protein-protein interaction maps (BioGRID, IntAct), and kinetic parameters curated from the literature (SABIO-RK). Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, mathematicians specializing in dynamical systems, control theory engineers, and computational scientists will develop and apply novel analytical strategies. We will use network topology analysis, information theory, and machine learning-based parameter inference to build predictive dynamical models of key signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, NF-κB). By comparing network architectures and dynamics across different pathways and organisms, we will identify recurring motifs, feedback/feedforward loop structures, and parameter regimes that confer robustness versus plasticity. The project will deliver a set of generalizable principles that explain how cells achieve this critical balance, with profound implications for understanding diseases where signaling is dysregulated (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders) and for the rational design of synthetic biological circuits.",

We will integrate complete genomes and proteomes from diverse eukaryotes, archaea (with a focus on the recently discovered Asgardarchaeota, our closest prokaryotic relatives), and bacteria from NCBI and UniProt. This will be combined with protein family phylogenies (OrthoDB), and a vast repository of protein structures (PDB, AlphaFold DB) to trace the origin and evolution of key eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs) involved in membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and nuclear organization. Our team, a unique collaboration of evolutionary biologists, cell biologists, structural bioinformaticians, and computational phylogenomicists, will use sophisticated computational methods to reconstruct ancestral protein functions and interaction networks. We aim to pinpoint the specific molecular innovations and horizontal gene transfers that enabled the emergence of eukaryotic complexity, resolving long-standing debates about the roles of endosymbiosis and autogenous evolution.

This code, composed of enhancers, promoters, and insulators, is interpreted by transcription factors to control development and cellular function. Despite decades of research, predicting gene expression patterns from DNA sequence alone remains a grand challenge. This Working Group will tackle this challenge by building a unified deep learning framework that synthesizes the wealth of public functional genomics data. We will leverage massive datasets from consortia like ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and the 4D Nucleome, including data on chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq), transcription factor binding (ChIP-seq), histone modifications, and 3D chromatin contacts (Hi-C). This will be integrated with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data from atlases like the Human Cell Atlas to provide the ground truth for gene expression. Our team, comprising experts in computational genomics, machine learning, developmental biology, and statistics, will develop novel convolutional and graph-based neural network architectures that can model not only the linear sequence but also the 3D context of the genome. The resulting model will predict cell-type-specific gene expression levels directly from the DNA sequence of a given locus.
