        "background_and_significance": "Protein folding is a fundamental process in biology, with implications for understanding disease mechanisms, drug design, and synthetic biology. Despite decades of research, the process remains poorly understood due to its complexity and the limitations of experimental techniques. Current computational models are unable to accurately predict protein folding pathways or the influence of cellular environments on this process. This project aims to address these gaps by synthesizing existing data from diverse sources, including molecular dynamics simulations, experimental data on protein structures, and cellular data on protein-protein interactions and cellular environments. This research is timely and important as it will provide new insights into protein folding, potentially leading to breakthroughs in understanding diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, which are associated with protein misfolding, and in designing more effective drugs and synthetic proteins.",

We hypothesize that protein folding is influenced by a combination of intrinsic factors (e.g., amino acid sequence, molecular dynamics) and extrinsic factors (e.g., cellular environment, protein-protein interactions). We predict that integrating these diverse data sources will lead to a more accurate and comprehensive model of protein folding.
