      "original_abstract": "A fundamental question in cell biology is whether universal principles govern the spatial organization of organelles and protein complexes, giving rise to robust cellular function. This project posits that a 'grammar of cellular architecture' exists, where local molecular interactions and physical constraints lead to emergent, predictable global organization. We propose to decipher this grammar by synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets that are currently siloed. This working group will bring together cell biologists, computer scientists specializing in vision and AI, biophysicists, and systems biologists to integrate high-content imaging data from repositories like the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the Human Cell Atlas with quantitative proteomics data from PRIDE and BioPlex. Our primary objective is to develop a novel computational framework, 'CellArchitect', that uses deep learning to segment and map the 3D spatial distribution and co-localization of thousands of proteins and organelles across millions of cells. By correlating these spatial maps with protein-protein interaction networks and functional annotations, we will move beyond simple co-localization to build predictive models of subcellular organization. We will employ methods from statistical physics and network theory to identify conserved spatial motifs, quantify organizational entropy, and derive rules that predict how perturbations to a single component cascade to alter the entire cellular architecture. This project is beyond the scope of any single lab due to the immense scale of the data and the required diversity of expertise.

        "background_and_significance": "The eukaryotic cell is a paragon of emergent complexity, a highly structured, dynamic entity where precise spatial organization is inextricably linked to function. From the segregation of biochemical reactions within membrane-bound organelles to the assembly of signaling complexes at specific subcellular locales, cellular architecture underpins all life processes. For decades, cell biologists have meticulously cataloged the cell's components and their individual functions. However, a comprehensive, predictive understanding of how these components assemble into a coherent, functioning whole remains one of the most significant unresolved challenges in modern biology. We lack a unifying framework—a 'grammar'—that explains how local molecular interactions give rise to global, emergent cellular form.\n\nThe current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data generated by two parallel technological revolutions. On one hand, advances in microscopy, including super-resolution, light-sheet, and cryo-electron tomography, have provided breathtaking views of the cell's interior. Large-scale initiatives like the Allen Cell Explorer and the Human Protein Atlas, along with public repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR), have made petabytes of high-resolution imaging data publicly available. These resources offer unprecedented spatial information on the localization of thousands of proteins and organelles. On the other hand, the proteomics revolution, driven by high-throughput mass spectrometry, has systematically mapped the cell's protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Techniques like affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent labeling (e.g., BioID, APEX), curated in databases like BioPlex and STRING, have generated comprehensive 'parts lists' and wiring diagrams of molecular machinery.\n\nDespite the power of these individual approaches, a critical gap exists: these vast imaging and proteomics datasets remain largely siloed. We have detailed maps of *where* proteins are located and separate maps of *what* proteins interact with, but we lack a systematic, large-scale integration of these two fundamental aspects of cellular organization. Current studies are often limited to a few proteins at a time, or they analyze organization in a static, averaged manner, failing to capture the cell-to-cell variability and dynamic nature of the system. Consequently, our understanding is often descriptive rather than predictive. We can observe that the endoplasmic reticulum makes contact with mitochondria, but we cannot predict from first principles how the density and structure of these contacts will change in response to metabolic stress. This inability to bridge the gap from molecular interactions to cellular architecture represents a major barrier to progress in understanding cellular function in health and disease.\n\nThis research is both important and timely for several reasons. First, the sheer volume and quality of publicly available data have reached a critical mass where a large-scale synthesis is not only possible but essential to extract maximal value. Second, recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning for image segmentation (e.g., CellPose, U-Net) and graph neural networks for analyzing complex relationships, provide the necessary computational tools to tackle this challenge at an unprecedented scale. Third, addressing this fundamental question has profound implications. A predictive model of cellular organization would transform our ability to understand diseases characterized by architectural defects, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and ciliopathies. It would also provide a foundational blueprint for synthetic biology, enabling the rational design of cells with novel functions. By synthesizing existing data to uncover the universal principles of cellular self-organization, this project will address a grand challenge in biology, moving the field from a descriptive to a predictive science of the cell.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is founded on the central hypothesis that the spatial organization of the eukaryotic cell is governed by a discoverable set of rules—a 'grammar'—where local protein-protein interactions and biophysical constraints give rise to emergent, predictable, and functionally optimized global architectures. We will test this overarching hypothesis through three specific, interconnected research aims.\n\n**Aim 1: To develop a multi-modal computational framework, 'CellArchitect', for integrating large-scale imaging and proteomics data to create a unified, spatially-resolved map of cellular organization.** This aim addresses the foundational challenge of data integration, creating the resource upon which subsequent discoveries will be built.\n*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can a unified deep learning pipeline accurately and automatically segment organelles and determine protein distributions from heterogeneous, multi-source public imaging data, thereby creating a standardized spatial coordinate system for the cell?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a federated learning model, leveraging a 3D U-Net architecture pre-trained on diverse datasets (e.g., Human Protein Atlas, OpenCell), can be fine-tuned to achieve robust, cross-dataset segmentation of at least ten major organelles and protein clusters with an average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.85. This will enable the mapping of thousands of proteins onto a canonical cellular reference frame, normalizing for variations in cell size, shape, and imaging modality.\n*   **Research Question 1.2:** How can we probabilistically fuse non-spatial protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with spatial co-localization data to generate a high-confidence, spatially-aware interactome?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.2:** We hypothesize that a Bayesian integration model, which combines biochemical evidence from proteomics (e.g., AP-MS scores from BioPlex) with spatial co-occurrence statistics (e.g., voxel-level correlation from our imaging pipeline), will significantly outperform either data type alone in predicting functionally related protein modules. This will result in a spatially-resolved interactome where interaction probabilities are conditional on subcellular location.\n\n**Aim 2: To identify and characterize conserved spatial motifs and organizational principles that constitute the 'grammar' of cellular architecture.** This aim seeks to extract fundamental rules from the integrated data map created in Aim 1.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** Do recurrent, statistically significant spatial arrangements of proteins and organelles—'supramolecular motifs'—exist, and are they conserved across different cell types and functional states?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that graph-based mining of the spatially-resolved interactome will reveal a finite set of conserved motifs (e.g., a specific geometric arrangement of metabolic enzymes around a mitochondrial crista, or a defined sequence of signaling proteins at the plasma membrane) that occur far more frequently than predicted by random chance. We predict these motifs will represent fundamental functional units of cellular organization.\n*   **Research Question 2.2:** Can we use principles from information theory and statistical physics to quantify the complexity, robustness, and efficiency of cellular organization?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** We hypothesize that cellular states can be characterized by a quantitative 'organizational entropy'. We predict that pluripotent stem cells will exhibit higher entropy (more organizational plasticity), while terminally differentiated cells will have lower entropy (a more fixed, optimized architecture). Furthermore, we predict that disease states, such as cancer, will be associated with an increase in organizational entropy, reflecting a breakdown of regulatory control.\n\n**Aim 3: To build and validate a predictive model of cellular architecture that can simulate the systemic effects of local perturbations.** This aim represents the ultimate test of our derived 'grammar'.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can the organizational rules derived in Aim 2 be formalized into a computational model that accurately predicts the global reorganization of the cell in response to the removal or alteration of a single component?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that a generative model, such as a graph neural network (GNN) trained on the CellArchitect atlas, can predict the new steady-state spatial distributions of key proteins following the in silico knockout of a network hub protein. We predict the model's output will show a high degree of concordance (e.g., Earth Mover's Distance below a validated threshold) with experimental imaging data from corresponding CRISPR-mediated knockout cell lines available in public repositories like the IDR. This will demonstrate a truly predictive understanding of cellular self-organization.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed through a phased, multi-year approach, integrating expertise from computer science, cell biology, proteomics, and biophysics. Our methodology is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and entirely based on the synthesis of publicly available data.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**\nOur foundation will be a meticulously curated collection of multi-modal data. \n*   **Imaging Data Sources:** We will systematically aggregate 3D imaging datasets from the Image Data Resource (IDR), the Allen Cell Explorer, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and the Chan Zuckerberg Institute's OpenCell project. Our selection criteria will prioritize datasets with high-resolution 3D stacks, multiple fluorescent channels, clear metadata (cell type, genetic background, treatment), and correspondence to cell lines with rich proteomics data (e.g., HEK293, HeLa, U2OS, A549). We will target an initial corpus of over 100 distinct studies, comprising millions of individual cell images.\n*   **Proteomics Data Sources:** We will compile a comprehensive human interactome from primary repositories like BioPlex (AP-MS), HuRI (Y2H), and proximity-labeling data curated from the PRIDE archive. We will supplement this with functional annotations from Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway information from KEGG and Reactome. \n*   **Standardization Pipeline:** A critical first step is to develop an automated pipeline to convert all data into a unified format. Imaging data will be converted to the OME-Zarr cloud-optimized format, which supports scalable, parallel access. We will apply standardized intensity normalization and metadata mapping to create an analysis-ready collection. Proteomics data will be integrated into a single graph structure, with edges weighted by a composite score reflecting the strength and type of evidence for each interaction.\n\n**Phase 2: The CellArchitect Framework - Integration and Mapping (Months 6-18)**\nThis phase focuses on the core technical development outlined in Aim 1.\n*   **Module 1: Unified Image Analysis Pipeline:** We will develop a multi-scale, deep learning-based segmentation engine. First, a robust instance segmentation model (e.g., CellPose) will identify individual cells and nuclei. Second, within each cell, a 3D U-Net model, trained on manually annotated data from HPA and Allen Cell, will perform semantic segmentation of major organelles (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes). Third, for fluorescently tagged proteins, a dedicated convolutional neural network will classify their localization patterns (e.g., punctate, diffuse, filamentous) and quantify their distribution relative to the segmented organelles. To enable cross-cell comparison, we will implement a canonical coordinate system transformation for each cell, aligning them based on the nuclear centroid and principal axes.\n*   **Module 2: Spatially-Resolved Interactome Construction:** We will bridge the imaging and proteomics data using a probabilistic framework. For every protein pair with evidence of a physical interaction from our proteomics graph, we will compute a suite of spatial co-occurrence metrics from the imaging data (e.g., Pearson's correlation, Manders' overlap coefficient, radial distribution functions). These spatial scores will be integrated with the biochemical interaction scores using a Bayesian network to yield a final probability for a 'spatially-active interaction'. The output will be a multi-layered graph representing the cell's spatially-resolved molecular network.\n\n**Phase 3: Discovering the 'Grammar' of Organization (Months 15-30)**\nWith the integrated atlas, we will address Aim 2.\n*   **Motif Discovery:** We will apply subgraph mining algorithms (e.g., gSpan) to the spatially-resolved interactome to identify recurrent patterns or 'motifs'. The statistical significance of these motifs will be rigorously tested against a null model generated by spatial permutation of protein locations, allowing us to distinguish true architectural principles from random co-occurrence.\n*   **Quantification of Organizational Principles:** We will implement algorithms to compute the 'organizational entropy' for each cell based on the predictability of protein and organelle locations within the voxelized cell volume. We will use statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) to compare entropy across different cell types, cell cycle stages, and perturbation conditions, testing our hypotheses about organizational complexity.\n*   **Rule Derivation:** Using machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees), we will build a classifier that learns the relationship between a protein's intrinsic properties (e.g., domain structure, network degree) and its emergent spatial properties. This will allow us to extract human-interpretable rules, such as 'Proteins containing a PX domain that interact with PI3P-binding proteins are localized to endosomes with 95% probability'.\n\n**Phase 4: Predictive Modeling and Validation (Months 24-36)**\nThis final phase will test the predictive power of our derived grammar (Aim 3).\n*   **Generative Model Development:** We will construct a predictive model using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. The model will take the PPI network and the state of a subset of proteins as input and learn to generate the 3D spatial coordinates for all other proteins in the cell. \n*   **In Silico Perturbations and Validation:** The model will be trained on the thousands of wild-type cells in our atlas. We will then validate its predictive power by performing in silico 'knockouts' (removing a node from the input graph) and comparing the model's predicted cellular reorganization to actual experimental data from public datasets featuring the corresponding gene knockout (e.g., from IDR). Quantitative comparison will be performed using metrics like the Wasserstein distance between predicted and observed protein distributions.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete data curation (M9). Release of v1.0 of the segmentation and feature extraction pipeline (M12).\n*   **Year 2:** Release of the first integrated spatially-resolved interactome for three cell lines (M18). Publication of the CellArchitect framework and initial findings on organizational entropy (M24).\n*   **Year 3:** Complete motif discovery and rule derivation (M30). Validate the predictive GNN model against at least five different knockout datasets (M33). Public release of the full, queryable CellArchitect Atlas and all associated software tools (M36).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "The successful completion of this project will yield transformative outcomes, providing foundational resources, novel methodologies, and fundamental biological insights that will have a broad and lasting impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Foundational, Queryable 4D Atlas of the Cell:** The primary deliverable will be the 'CellArchitect Atlas,' a public, web-accessible resource that integrates spatial and molecular interaction data for thousands of proteins across millions of cells. This will be a paradigm-shifting resource, analogous to the reference human genome. It will empower researchers to ask complex questions that are currently intractable, such as, 'What is the consensus spatial arrangement of all components of the mTOR signaling pathway in response to nutrient starvation?' or 'Which protein-protein interactions are most significantly altered in their spatial context between a normal and a cancerous cell line?'. This atlas will serve as a central hub for hypothesis generation and data exploration for the entire cell biology community.\n2.  **Novel, Open-Source Computational Tools:** We will develop and disseminate a suite of powerful, open-source software tools for the large-scale, integrative analysis of multi-modal biological data. The CellArchitect pipeline for automated image segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial-proteomic integration will be a significant methodological contribution, applicable to a wide range of biological imaging and systems biology problems. These tools will lower the barrier to entry for complex data synthesis, democratizing this research area.\n3.  **Discovery of Fundamental Principles of Cellular Organization:** This project will move cell biology from a largely descriptive to a predictive science. By identifying conserved spatial motifs and deriving the 'grammatical rules' of cellular architecture, we will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how robust cellular form and function emerge from molecular parts. This will represent a fundamental advance in our understanding of self-organization in living systems, a central theme in biology.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n1.  **Advancing Human Health:** A predictive understanding of cellular architecture has profound implications for medicine. The organizational entropy metric we propose could serve as a novel, quantitative biomarker for disease states like cancer, where cellular disorganization is a hallmark. Our predictive models could be used to screen for therapeutic compounds that restore normal cellular architecture or to understand the mechanisms of drug action at a systems level. This work will provide a new lens through which to view diseases of cellular organization, including neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and viral infections.\n2.  **Enabling Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** The rational design of synthetic cells and biological circuits is currently limited by our incomplete understanding of spatial organization. The rules and models generated by this project will provide a 'design blueprint' for synthetic biologists, enabling them to engineer cells with novel functions by precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of components.\n3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Scientists:** As mandated by the research call, this project is intrinsically designed for training. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work at the intersection of cell biology, AI, and biophysics, acquiring a unique and highly sought-after skillset. Through collaborative workshops and open-source software development, they will become leaders in the emerging field of quantitative, data-driven cell biology, directly contributing to the development of a future-ready scientific workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science:**\nOur commitment to open science is absolute. All curated data, source code for all models and pipelines, and the final CellArchitect Atlas will be made publicly available under permissive licenses (e.g., MIT for code, CC-BY for data). We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. We will actively disseminate our work through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ASCB, ISMB, NeurIPS) and will host annual workshops to train the broader scientific community on how to use our data resources and computational tools. The project's long-term vision is to establish the CellArchitect Atlas as a living, community-driven resource that will be continuously updated and expanded, ensuring its sustained impact on the biosciences.",

      "original_abstract": "Viruses are master manipulators of cellular machinery, but the common principles and evolutionary trade-offs governing their strategies remain poorly understood. This project will address a long-standing puzzle: what are the conserved molecular 'choke points' in the host cell that are targeted by diverse viruses, and how do host defense networks evolve to counter these attacks? We will assemble a multidisciplinary team of virologists, immunologists, bioinformaticians, and evolutionary biologists to conduct a community-scale synthesis of all publicly available host-pathogen interaction data. Our working group will integrate disparate datasets including transcriptomics (GEO, SRA), proteomics (PRIDE), and protein-protein interaction data (BioGRID, IntAct) spanning hundreds of different viral infections in human and other host species. The core of our approach is to build a multi-layered, pan-viral interaction network. We will develop novel graph-based machine learning algorithms to identify 'viral hijacking modules'—sets of host proteins and pathways consistently targeted by unrelated viruses—and corresponding 'emergent host defense modules'—conserved transcriptional and signaling responses that constitute the core of the intrinsic immune system. By comparing the strategies of DNA vs. RNA viruses, or acute vs. persistent viruses, we will uncover the evolutionary logic behind different hijacking strategies.

        "background_and_significance": "Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, engage in a complex and dynamic interplay with their hosts, representing a quintessential example of a co-evolutionary arms race. To replicate, viruses must commandeer the host's molecular machinery for transcription, translation, and energy production while simultaneously evading sophisticated immune surveillance systems. This intimate relationship has been the subject of intense study for decades, yielding deep insights into the infection cycles of individual pathogens. Seminal works have elucidated how influenza virus's NS1 protein antagonizes interferon signaling, how HIV's Vif protein degrades the host antiviral factor APOBEC3G, and how human papillomavirus E6 and E7 proteins subvert cell cycle control by targeting p53 and pRb. These studies, while foundational, have predominantly focused on a single virus or a single family of viruses. Consequently, our understanding of host-pathogen interactions remains highly fragmented, resembling a collection of detailed but disconnected case studies rather than a unified theoretical framework. The central gap in our knowledge is the absence of a systems-level, pan-viral perspective. We lack a comprehensive understanding of the common principles and convergent strategies employed by diverse, unrelated viruses to manipulate the host cell. Are there universal cellular vulnerabilities—molecular 'choke points'—that are repeatedly exploited? Conversely, does the host mount a conserved, core defense response that represents an emergent property of the cellular network, independent of the specific viral trigger? Answering these questions has been historically intractable due to methodological and data limitations. However, the landscape has been transformed by two key developments. First, the explosion of high-throughput 'omics' technologies has led to an unprecedented accumulation of publicly available data. Repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and the PRIDE Archive now house thousands of datasets detailing the transcriptomic and proteomic consequences of viral infections across a vast array of viruses and host systems. Concurrently, databases such as BioGRID and IntAct have systematically curated tens of thousands of individual virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This wealth of data represents a massively underutilized resource for discovering higher-order biological principles. Second, recent advances in computer science, particularly in network biology and machine learning, provide the analytical tools necessary to integrate these vast, heterogeneous datasets and extract meaningful patterns. Previous attempts at meta-analysis have been limited in scope, often focusing on a single data type (e.g., PPIs only) or a small subset of viruses, failing to capture the multi-faceted nature of the host response. This project is therefore both important and timely. The recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a stark reminder of the threat posed by emerging viral pathogens and underscored the urgent need for strategies to rapidly understand and combat novel viruses. By synthesizing the entirety of available public data, we can move beyond virus-specific details to uncover the fundamental rules of engagement in the host-virus conflict. This community-scale effort, which requires the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and evolutionary theorists, is perfectly aligned with the call to address fundamental questions through data synthesis. It will not only solve a long-standing puzzle in molecular and cellular biology but also provide a powerful new resource for predicting the impact of future pandemics and identifying the next generation of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to define the conserved principles of viral manipulation and host defense by synthesizing the global corpus of host-pathogen interaction data. We will move beyond single-pathogen studies to address fundamental questions about the emergent properties of these complex biological systems. Our research is structured around four specific, interconnected questions, each with testable hypotheses.\n\n**Research Question 1: What are the conserved molecular modules within the host cell that are convergently targeted by phylogenetically diverse viruses?**\nWe posit that the intricate and interconnected nature of the host cellular network creates inherent vulnerabilities, or 'choke points', that diverse viruses have independently evolved to exploit. \n*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1): Viral Convergence on Cellular Hubs.** Viruses from distinct families will convergently target a limited set of host proteins and pathways that are topologically central or functionally critical within the host interactome. These 'viral hijacking modules' are not random but are enriched for specific cellular functions essential for viral replication and immune evasion.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that our pan-viral network analysis will identify a statistically significant over-representation of viral interactions with host modules involved in core processes like mRNA translation (e.g., ribosomal subunits, eIF4F complex), nucleocytoplasmic transport (e.g., importins, nuclear pore components), protein degradation (e.g., ubiquitin ligases, proteasome subunits), and central metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway). We will validate these computationally identified modules by assessing their enrichment for known broad-spectrum antiviral drug targets and host dependency factors identified in genome-wide CRISPR screens.\n\n**Research Question 2: Can we define a core, 'pan-viral host defense program' that represents an emergent, conserved response to diverse viral infections?**\nWhile each virus elicits unique cellular responses, we hypothesize that an underlying, conserved defense network is activated as a general anti-pathogen state.\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2): Emergence of a Core Defense Network.** Integration of multi-omic data will reveal a core set of host genes, proteins, and signaling pathways whose activity is consistently perturbed across a majority of viral infections, forming a robust, emergent host defense module. \n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict this module will include, but extend beyond, the canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). It will encompass specific stress response pathways (e.g., integrated stress response, UPR), metabolic reprogramming signatures (e.g., shifts away from anabolic pathways), and post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation cascades) that are consistently observed regardless of the infecting virus's family. We will test this by comparing the transcriptional and proteomic signatures across hundreds of infection datasets and using permutation testing to define a statistically robust core response.\n\n**Research Question 3: How do viral hijacking strategies correlate with fundamental viral characteristics, such as genome type, replication site, and chronicity?**\nThe evolutionary trade-offs faced by a virus are shaped by its basic biology. We hypothesize that these constraints dictate the specific sets of host modules it targets.\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3): Biological Constraints Shape Hijacking Strategy.** A virus's hijacking strategy is non-random and predictable based on its biological properties. For example, RNA viruses will preferentially target host RNA-binding proteins and splicing machinery, while persistent viruses (e.g., herpesviruses) will target apoptotic and cell cycle checkpoints more subtly than acute, lytic viruses (e.g., influenza).\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We will classify all viruses in our dataset and perform comparative analyses. We predict that statistical tests (e.g., enrichment analysis, MANOVA) will reveal significant differences in the host modules targeted by DNA vs. RNA viruses, nuclear vs. cytoplasmic replicating viruses, and acute vs. persistent viruses. For instance, we expect to find that persistent viruses are significantly enriched for interactions with host anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 family) and immune modulators (e.g., MHC class I pathway components).\n\n**Research Question 4: Can the identified modules be leveraged to predict the cellular impact of emerging viruses and identify novel, broad-spectrum antiviral targets?**\nA key outcome of this synthesis is the creation of a predictive framework.\n*   **Hypothesis 4 (H4): Network Modules Have Predictive Power.** The identified hijacking and defense modules constitute a functional map of the host-virus interface that can be used to predict which host factors a novel virus is likely to target and to prioritize host proteins as high-confidence, broad-spectrum antiviral drug targets.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We will build a machine learning model trained on our network to predict host targets based on viral protein sequence features. We will test its performance on a hold-out set of viruses not used in training. We will predict that proteins central to multiple hijacking modules, but with low connectivity in the uninfected host network, represent ideal broad-spectrum targets, as their inhibition would be highly disruptive to many viruses but potentially less toxic to the host. These predictions will generate a prioritized list of targets for future experimental validation.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a community-scale computational synthesis effort that will proceed in three integrated phases. Our multidisciplinary team has the requisite expertise in virology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and network biology to execute this ambitious plan.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Aggregation, Curation, and Harmonization (Months 1-12)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on building the comprehensive data resource that will underpin all subsequent analyses. This task is beyond the scope of a single lab and requires a coordinated working group.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically mine all relevant publicly available data. \n    *   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** We will aggregate data from major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, MINT, and the virus-specific VirHostNet. We will capture both virus-host and host-host interactions, along with associated experimental evidence codes.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** Using the NCBI API and custom scripts, we will query GEO, SRA, and ArrayExpress for all datasets related to viral infection in human and key model organisms (e.g., mouse, macaque). We will develop a rigorous set of inclusion criteria, requiring, for example, the presence of mock-infected controls, sufficient biological replicates (n≥3), and detailed experimental metadata.\n    *   **Proteomics and Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs):** We will retrieve datasets from the PRIDE archive and PhosphoSitePlus, focusing on studies that quantify changes in protein abundance or phosphorylation status upon infection.\n*   **Standardized Processing Pipeline:** To ensure comparability and minimize batch effects, all raw transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) will be reprocessed through a single, containerized pipeline (e.g., using Nextflow). This pipeline will include quality control (FastQC), adapter trimming (Trimmomatic), alignment to a reference genome (STAR), and quantification (RSEM). Differential expression analysis will be consistently performed using DESeq2. All genes, proteins, and viruses will be mapped to stable, standardized identifiers (Ensembl, UniProt, NCBI Taxonomy).\n\n**Phase 2: Multi-Layer Network Construction and Module Discovery (Months 10-24)**\nThis phase involves the core intellectual and methodological innovation of the project.\n*   **Network Construction:** We will construct a heterogeneous, multi-layered network. Nodes in the network will represent host proteins/genes and viral proteins. Edges will represent different types of biological relationships, each forming a distinct layer: 1) physical PPIs, 2) regulatory interactions (inferred from consistent differential gene expression), and 3) post-translational modifications (e.g., kinase-substrate relationships inferred from phosphoproteomics). Edges will be weighted based on the strength and consistency of evidence across multiple datasets.\n*   **Novel Module Discovery Algorithm:** Standard community detection algorithms are ill-suited for identifying 'targeted' modules in a multi-layered, bipartite network. We will develop a novel graph-based machine learning approach, likely a Graph Attention Network (GAT) or a similar Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. This algorithm will be trained to learn node embeddings that capture both the topological properties within the host network and the interaction patterns with diverse viral proteins. 'Viral hijacking modules' will be identified as communities of host nodes that are recurrently and significantly targeted by proteins from phylogenetically diverse viruses. 'Emergent host defense modules' will be identified as densely connected host nodes that exhibit consistent activation signatures (e.g., upregulation, phosphorylation) across a wide range of viral infections.\n\n**Phase 3: Comparative Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, and Resource Development (Months 18-36)**\nIn this final phase, we will use the constructed network and identified modules to test our hypotheses and create a lasting public resource.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing:** We will employ a rigorous statistical framework. For H1 (Convergence), we will use permutation testing to assess whether the observed targeting of specific modules by diverse viruses is greater than expected by chance. For H2 (Core Defense), we will define a core response set and analyze its functional and topological properties. For H3 (Strategy Correlation), we will use multivariate statistical methods to correlate viral traits (e.g., genome type) with the specific sets of host modules they target. For H4 (Prediction), we will use the network to train a predictive model and validate it on held-out data.\n*   **The Viral Interactome Atlas:** A key deliverable will be a public, web-based portal. This resource, built using modern web frameworks (e.g., React, D3.js), will allow users to visualize the pan-viral network, query specific viruses or host proteins, explore the identified modules, and download all underlying data and analysis results. \n*   **Timeline and Milestones:**\n    *   **Year 1:** Complete data curation pipeline; release harmonized dataset v1.0. Develop and benchmark module discovery algorithm on a pilot dataset. \n    *   **Year 2:** Construct the full pan-viral multi-layer network. Identify and functionally annotate the first draft of hijacking and defense modules. Launch beta version of the Viral Interactome Atlas for community feedback. Submit methods paper.\n    *   **Year 3:** Complete all comparative analyses and hypothesis testing. Finalize and publicly launch the Viral Interactome Atlas v1.0. Submit primary research articles. Host a community-wide dissemination workshop.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on biomedical research and public health. Our expected outcomes are organized around advancing fundamental knowledge, developing novel resources and methods, training the next generation of scientists, and providing a direct pathway to new therapeutic strategies.\n\n**Advancement of Scientific Knowledge:**\nThe primary outcome will be a paradigm shift from a virus-centric to a systems-level, pan-viral understanding of host-pathogen interactions. By identifying conserved 'viral hijacking modules,' we will uncover the fundamental cellular vulnerabilities that have been repeatedly exploited throughout evolutionary history. This will resolve the long-standing puzzle of whether common principles govern viral infection. Similarly, the characterization of an 'emergent host defense module' will provide a definitive, data-driven definition of the core intrinsic immune response, revealing the fundamental logic of how cells sense and react to a generic viral threat. These findings will provide a new conceptual framework for virology, cell biology, and immunology, with direct implications for understanding the emergent properties of complex biological networks.\n\n**Development of a Lasting Community Resource:**\nA major tangible outcome is the 'Viral Interactome Atlas.' This will not be a static data release but a dynamic, open-access web portal and knowledge base. It will serve as a central resource for the global research community, enabling any researcher to query their virus or host protein of interest and place it within the context of the entire known virus-host interactome. This will democratize access to large-scale systems analysis and will catalyze countless new hypotheses and research directions. For example, a researcher studying a newly discovered virus could use the Atlas to generate immediate, data-driven hypotheses about its mechanism of action, dramatically accelerating the research cycle. The underlying code, data, and network models will be openly shared, fostering reproducibility and further methodological innovation.\n\n**Broader Impacts on Human Health and Pandemic Preparedness:**\nThe impact of this work extends directly to public health. The identified hijacking modules are, by definition, critical for the replication of many different viruses. The host proteins within these modules therefore represent a rich source of high-confidence targets for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Such host-targeted therapies are less prone to the development of viral resistance and could be deployed against newly emerging pathogens for which specific drugs do not yet exist. The Atlas will become a critical tool for pandemic preparedness, allowing for rapid in silico analysis of novel pathogens to predict their cellular targets and suggest potential therapeutic interventions.\n\n**Training and Workforce Development:**\nThis project is an ideal training vehicle for the next generation of data-savvy scientists. Trainees (graduate students and postdocs) will be co-mentored by experts in disparate fields, gaining unique cross-disciplinary skills in computational biology, data integration, machine learning, network science, and virology. They will learn to manage large-scale collaborative projects, adhere to open science principles, and communicate effectively across disciplines. Through hands-on participation in working group meetings and workshops, they will build a professional network that will serve them throughout their careers. This training directly addresses the critical need for a workforce that can leverage the growing deluge of biological data to solve complex problems.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Sustainability:**\nWe will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, presentations at major international conferences, and the public launch of the Atlas. We will host a final workshop to share our results with the broader community and foster new collaborations. The project is designed for long-term sustainability; the Atlas will be built with a framework for community-driven updates. We will seek follow-on funding to maintain and expand the resource, ensuring it remains a valuable and up-to-date hub for the systems virology community long after the initial funding period concludes.",

The budget is designed to support a distributed team of ten PIs and their trainees over a three-year period, with a focus on personnel, collaboration, and computational infrastructure.\n\n**1. Personnel (Approximately 70% of total budget):**\n*   **Principal Investigators (10 PIs):** We request 1.0 month of summer salary per year for each PI.

        "background_and_significance": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is now understood not as a passive scaffold for malignant cells, but as a complex, adaptive ecosystem whose emergent properties dictate cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic response. This ecosystem comprises a heterogeneous consortium of cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and a diverse array of immune cells. The collective behavior of this system arises from intricate, spatially-defined intercellular communication networks. A critical axis of this communication is metabolism. The century-old observation of the Warburg effect, where cancer cells favor glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, has evolved into a more nuanced understanding of metabolic plasticity and interdependence. It is now clear that a tumor's metabolic phenotype is a collective property, driven by a phenomenon known as metabolic symbiosis, where different cell populations exchange metabolites to optimize nutrient utilization and support mutual survival and growth. Seminal studies have illuminated pairwise symbiotic relationships. For instance, the 'reverse Warburg effect' describes how glycolytic CAFs secrete lactate, which is then taken up and utilized as a primary fuel source by oxidative cancer cells, thereby sparing glucose for other anabolic processes. This lactate shuttle, mediated by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), not only fuels cancer proliferation but also profoundly shapes the TME by inducing angiogenesis and suppressing immune function; high lactate levels are known to inhibit T-cell and natural killer cell activity. Beyond lactate, other metabolites like glutamine, ammonia, and lipids are actively exchanged between cancer cells and various stromal and immune populations, creating a web of metabolic dependencies. However, our current understanding of this metabolic web is fragmented and incomplete. The vast majority of studies have focused on simplified co-culture systems or have examined single metabolic pathways in isolation. This reductionist approach fails to capture the complexity and emergent nature of the TME's metabolic network. A key limitation has been the reliance on bulk-level analyses of tumor tissue. Bulk omics data, while powerful, averages the molecular signals from all constituent cell types, obscuring the cell-type-specific metabolic programs and the crucial intercellular exchanges that define the ecosystem. We lack a systems-level, spatially-resolved map of metabolic flux within the in-vivo TME. This knowledge gap represents a major barrier to developing effective metabolic therapies. Without understanding the full network of dependencies, therapeutic interventions targeting a single pathway may be circumvented by the system's metabolic plasticity. This project is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the explosion of publicly available multi-omics data, including thousands of tumor profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), provides an unprecedented substrate for data synthesis. Second, the recent surge in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets offers the potential to deconvolve the cellular heterogeneity of bulk tissues with ever-increasing resolution. Third, advances in computational systems biology, particularly in constraint-based modeling, provide the formalisms necessary to integrate these disparate data types and simulate metabolic function. By synthesizing these vast public data resources, this project will address a fundamental question in cancer biology: how does the collective metabolic network of a tumor emerge from the interactions of its constituent parts? Answering this question is beyond the scope of any single lab, requiring a transdisciplinary working group of cancer biologists, computational scientists, and systems modelers to integrate heterogeneous data and develop novel analytical strategies, perfectly aligning with the mission of this research call.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this research is to construct the first comprehensive, spatially-resolved atlas of metabolic symbiosis in the tumor microenvironment across multiple human cancers. By synthesizing a massive corpus of public multi-omics data, we aim to move beyond pairwise interactions and map the emergent, system-level metabolic network that drives tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. This goal is structured around four specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses. \n\n**Research Question 1: How do the metabolic phenotypes of distinct cell populations (cancer subclones, fibroblast subtypes, endothelial cells, immune infiltrates) co-vary within the TME, and how are they shaped by their local cellular neighborhood?**\nThis question addresses the fundamental issue of metabolic plasticity as a function of cellular context. We hypothesize that a cell's metabolic state is not an intrinsic, static property but is dynamically programmed by signals and metabolites from adjacent cells. \n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** The metabolic activity of cancer cells is a direct emergent property of their spatial proximity to specific stromal and immune cells. \n    *   **Prediction:** Our spatially-aware models will predict that cancer cells physically adjacent to lactate-secreting CAFs will exhibit significantly higher flux through oxidative phosphorylation pathways compared to cancer cells in fibroblast-poor regions. Conversely, cancer cells in immune-cell-rich 'hot' regions will exhibit distinct metabolic profiles compared to those in 'cold' regions. \n    *   **Validation:** We will validate this by correlating the predicted metabolic fluxes with the expression of metabolic pathway markers in spatially-resolved transcriptomics datasets. We will test for statistically significant associations between cell-type co-localization patterns and metabolic gene expression signatures across thousands of TCGA samples. \n\n**Research Question 2: What are the principal metabolic exchange networks that define symbiotic and competitive relationships within the TME, and which metabolites serve as the primary currencies of exchange?**\nWe aim to identify the key metabolic highways that connect different cell populations. \n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** A conserved set of metabolic exchange networks, centered on a lactate-glutamine-ammonia axis, forms the backbone of TME symbiosis across diverse solid tumor types (e.g., pancreatic, breast, lung). \n    *   **Prediction:** Our multi-cellular flux balance analysis will consistently predict high rates of lactate export from CAFs, lactate import by cancer cells, and a coupled exchange of glutamine and its byproducts between these and other cell types. \n    *   **Validation:** We will seek evidence for these predicted fluxes by examining the coordinated expression of key metabolite transporters (e.g., MCT1, MCT4, ASCT2) and metabolic enzymes in our deconvoluted TCGA data. A strong positive correlation in the expression of a CAF lactate exporter and a cancer cell lactate importer would support our prediction. \n\n**Research Question 3: How does the spatial architecture of the TME constrain the topology of the metabolic interaction network and create localized metabolic niches?**\nThis question links physical structure to metabolic function. \n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** The TME is organized into distinct metabolic niches, such as immunosuppressive niches characterized by high lactate and low glucose, which spatially exclude effector T-cells. \n    *   **Prediction:** Our models will identify spatial 'hotspots' of immunosuppressive metabolite production (e.g., lactate, kynurenine) that spatially anti-correlate with the predicted activity and infiltration of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. \n    *   **Validation:** We will use publicly available spatial proteomics (e.g., MIBI, CODEX) and transcriptomics data to confirm the predicted spatial segregation of immune cells from these metabolically hostile niches. \n\n**Research Question 4: Can we identify conserved metabolic dependencies within these symbiotic networks that represent robust, pan-cancer therapeutic vulnerabilities?**\nThis is the translational thrust of our project. \n*   **Hypothesis 4.1:** The metabolic network of the TME contains critical 'choke points'—enzymes or transporters essential for maintaining the symbiotic state—whose inhibition would cause a systemic collapse of the tumor ecosystem. \n    *   **Prediction:** In-silico gene/reaction knockout simulations in our community metabolic models will identify specific targets (e.g., a transporter on a stromal cell) whose removal leads to a significant reduction in cancer cell biomass production. \n    *   **Validation:** We will prioritize predicted targets by cross-referencing them with cancer dependency maps (e.g., DepMap) and clinical data to assess their potential as viable therapeutic targets. The top-ranked predictions will form the basis for future experimental collaborations.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will synthesize vast, publicly available datasets through a novel, multi-stage computational pipeline. Our approach is designed to systematically deconstruct the complexity of the TME, reconstruct its metabolic network, and simulate its behavior to uncover emergent properties. The project is organized into three synergistic Aims.\n\n**Aim 1: Comprehensive Curation and Harmonization of Public Multi-Omics Data.**\nThe foundation of this synthesis project is the rigorous aggregation and processing of diverse data types. This effort requires significant bioinformatic expertise and is a key area where NCEMS support is critical.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will leverage several major public data repositories. \n    1.  **Bulk Genomics/Proteomics:** We will download and process RNA-sequencing, copy number variation, mutation, and clinical data for all available solid tumor cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (~33 cancer types, >11,000 patients). This will be complemented by quantitative proteomics data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) for overlapping cohorts, providing a crucial layer of protein-level validation.\n    2.  **Single-Cell Transcriptomics (scRNA-seq):** We will compile a comprehensive database of publicly available TME scRNA-seq studies from repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Human Cell Atlas. We will initially target major solid tumors (e.g., breast, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, melanoma), curating data from over 100 independent studies encompassing millions of cells. \n    3.  **Spatial Transcriptomics:** We will gather all available spatial transcriptomics datasets (e.g., 10x Visium, Slide-seq) for human tumors. This data is critical for providing the spatial context and ground truth for our models.\n*   **Data Harmonization:** A major challenge is the heterogeneity of these datasets. We will develop a standardized processing pipeline to harmonize them. This includes: uniform alignment and quantification of sequencing data, batch correction across studies using algorithms like ComBat-seq, standardization of gene and protein nomenclature, and consistent clinical data annotation.\n\n**Aim 2: Development and Application of a Spatially-Informed Cellular Deconvolution Framework.**\nThis Aim focuses on computationally dissecting bulk tumor data into its constituent cell-type-specific components, a key innovation of our proposal.\n*   **Step 1: Building a TME Cell Type Signature Matrix:** Using the harmonized scRNA-seq data from Aim 1, we will perform unsupervised clustering and expert-guided annotation to identify all major cell populations and their subtypes (e.g., cancer epithelial, myofibroblastic vs. inflammatory CAFs, M1 vs. M2 macrophages, T-cell subtypes). We will then use statistical methods to define a robust, context-specific gene expression signature for each cell type.\n*   **Step 2: Deconvolution of Bulk TCGA/CPTAC Data:** We will employ and enhance machine learning-based deconvolution algorithms (e.g., CIBERSORTx, BayesPrism) to estimate the relative abundance and infer the cell-type-specific expression profiles for every cell type in each of the >11,000 TCGA tumors. This will transform the bulk data into a pseudo-multi-cellular dataset.\n*   **Step 3: Integrating Spatial Constraints:** We will use the spatial transcriptomics data to build a probabilistic model of cell-cell co-occurrence. This model will learn which cell types are likely to be physically adjacent. This spatial prior will then be integrated into our deconvolution framework to refine the cell-type-specific expression profiles, making them spatially aware.\n\n**Aim 3: Spatially-Resolved Community Metabolic Modeling and Simulation.**\nThis Aim will use the outputs from Aim 2 to construct and analyze predictive models of TME metabolism.\n*   **Step 1: Contextualizing Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs):** We will use the inferred cell-type-specific gene and protein expression profiles to customize a human GEM (e.g., Recon3D). For each cell type in each tumor, we will use algorithms like GIMME or iMAT to generate a specific metabolic model that reflects its likely metabolic activity.\n*   **Step 2: Assembling Multi-Cellular Community Models:** We will combine the individual cell-type GEMs into a single community model for each tumor. Critically, we will model the exchange of metabolites through a shared extracellular compartment. The maximum rate of exchange between any two cell types will be constrained by their estimated spatial proximity from Aim 2. This ensures that only adjacent cells can efficiently exchange metabolites, a key feature missing from previous models.\n*   **Step 3: Simulation and Analysis:** We will use constraint-based methods, primarily Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), to simulate metabolic activity. We will set the objective function to maximize cancer cell proliferation while other cells perform ATP maintenance. By simulating thousands of these tumor-specific community models, we will identify common metabolic flux patterns, predict key metabolite exchanges, and perform in-silico knockout simulations to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities (choke points).\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete Aim 1 (data acquisition/harmonization). Develop and validate the deconvolution pipeline (Aim 2). Publish the pipeline as an open-source tool.\n*   **Year 2:** Apply the pipeline to all TCGA cohorts. Construct and simulate community metabolic models for 5 priority cancer types (Aim 3). Develop beta version of the web portal.\n*   **Year 3:** Complete simulations for all cohorts. Perform pan-cancer analysis to identify conserved vulnerabilities. Launch and publicize the final interactive web portal. Submit primary manuscripts.",

This will reveal how system-level properties like aggressive growth and drug resistance emerge from local, multi-cellular interactions. This atlas will provide a foundational resource for understanding the metabolic principles that govern tumor progression.\n2.  **Methodological Innovation in Computational Biology:** We will develop and disseminate a novel, open-source computational framework for the integrative analysis of bulk, single-cell, and spatial omics data. This spatially-aware deconvolution and metabolic modeling pipeline will be a significant methodological advance, applicable not only to cancer but to any complex, heterogeneous tissue (e.g., in neuroscience, immunology, or developmental biology). This addresses the call's goal to develop innovative analytical strategies.\n3.  **Generation of Novel, Testable Hypotheses:** Our simulations will generate hundreds of specific, high-priority hypotheses about metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities in the TME. For example, we might hypothesize that a specific amino acid transporter on endothelial cells is essential for fueling cancer cell growth in glioblastoma. These data-driven hypotheses will provide a rich substrate for experimental validation by the broader research community, accelerating the pace of discovery.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n1.  **Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets:** By identifying conserved metabolic 'choke points' within the symbiotic network, this project will provide a rational basis for a new generation of cancer therapies. Targeting the metabolic support infrastructure of the tumor (e.g., stromal cell metabolism) rather than the genetically unstable cancer cell is a promising strategy to overcome acquired drug resistance. Our ranked list of vulnerabilities will be a valuable starting point for pharmaceutical development.\n2.  **Development of a Community-Wide Resource:** A key deliverable is the creation of an open-access, interactive web portal. This portal will allow researchers worldwide, regardless of their computational expertise, to explore our results. A biologist could, for instance, query the predicted metabolic flux of their favorite gene in a specific cell type in breast cancer, or a clinician could explore the metabolic differences between responder and non-responder patient tumors. This resource will democratize access to complex data synthesis and significantly amplify the project's impact.\n3.  **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** As mandated by the research call, this project is an ideal training vehicle. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work at the cutting edge of data science, cancer biology, and systems modeling. They will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary skills in large-scale data management, machine learning, and computational modeling, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy biomedical workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science:**\nOur commitment to open science is unwavering. All software developed will be released on GitHub with permissive open-source licenses. All processed data, models, and results will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare). We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals and present our work at major international conferences (e.g., AACR, ISMB, RECOMB). This multi-pronged approach ensures that our methods, data, and discoveries are immediately and broadly available, maximizing their utility and impact for the scientific community and the public.",

        "background_and_significance": "The central dogma of molecular biology, for decades, was dominated by the sequence-structure-function paradigm, where a protein's function was inextricably linked to a unique, stable three-dimensional structure. However, the sequencing of eukaryotic genomes revealed a startling reality: a significant fraction of proteomes, over 30% in humans, consists of proteins or regions that lack a fixed structure under physiological conditions. These intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) challenged classical structural biology and were initially dismissed as biological noise. We now understand that this conformational heterogeneity is not a bug but a feature, enabling a vast range of functions that are inaccessible to structured proteins. IDPs are central hubs in cellular interaction networks, mediating signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin remodeling. Their functional advantage lies in their ability to form dynamic, multivalent, and often transient interactions, creating what has been termed 'fuzzy' complexes. This dynamic binding allows them to act as scaffolds, sensors, and regulators, integrating multiple cellular signals. A key emergent phenomenon driven by IDPs is liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a thermodynamic process where multivalent interactions among IDPs and RNA drive their demixing from the cytoplasm to form membraneless organelles (MLOs). These biomolecular condensates, such as nucleoli, stress granules, and P-bodies, are dynamic compartments that concentrate specific molecules to enhance reaction rates, sequester components, and organize the cellular landscape. The physical principles governing LLPS are rooted in polymer physics, where IDPs are treated as associative polymers. The 'stickers-and-spacers' model provides a conceptual framework, where 'stickers' (e.g., aromatic or charged residues) mediate specific interactions, and flexible 'spacers' determine the polymer's conformational properties and the phase behavior of the system. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation act as a crucial regulatory layer, altering the 'stickiness' of these motifs and dynamically tuning the formation and dissolution of condensates in response to cellular cues. The importance of IDPs is underscored by their profound link to human disease. The misregulation of IDP interactions or their aberrant phase transitions into irreversible, solid-like aggregates are hallmarks of numerous pathologies. For instance, the hyperphosphorylation of the IDP Tau is linked to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, while mutations in the disordered regions of FUS and TDP-43 promote their aggregation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In oncology, oncogenic IDPs like c-Myc and p53 are master regulators whose disordered regions are critical for their function and dysregulation in cancer. Despite this progress, a fundamental gap persists in our understanding: we lack a predictive framework that can translate the primary amino acid sequence of an IDP into its functional interactome and emergent phase behavior. Current computational tools are fragmented. Some predictors, like IUPred2A or PONDR, can identify disordered regions with reasonable accuracy. Others, such as those searching for short linear motifs (SLiMs), can predict potential binding sites but often suffer from high false-positive rates and lack context. Similarly, algorithms like FuzDrop and PSPredictor estimate LLPS propensity based on general sequence features but cannot predict specific interaction partners or the material properties of the resulting condensates. This fragmentation prevents a holistic understanding of how sequence encodes function. The time is ripe to address this challenge. We are at a unique confluence of massive, publicly available biological data—from genomic and proteomic sequences (UniProt), curated disorder annotations (DisProt), interaction networks (BioGRID), structural snapshots (PDB, AlphaFold DB), and PTM atlases (PhosphoSitePlus)—and revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning models like transformers. These models have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to learn context and long-range dependencies in sequential data, as exemplified by AlphaFold2's success in protein structure prediction. By synthesizing these vast datasets through a purpose-built deep learning architecture, we can begin to decipher the 'interaction grammar' of IDPs, creating a unified model that bridges the scales from sequence to emergent cellular function.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is driven by a central, overarching goal: to develop a computational framework that can predict the emergent functional landscape of an intrinsically disordered protein directly from its amino acid sequence. To achieve this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses that will guide our data synthesis and modeling efforts. Our approach is designed to move beyond simple classification (e.g., disordered/ordered) towards a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of IDP function.\n\n**Research Question 1: Can a unified 'interaction grammar' be learned from IDP sequences to accurately predict specific binding partners and the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs)?**\nThis question addresses the fundamental challenge of mapping sequence to specific molecular interactions. While we know certain motifs are important, we hypothesize that the context in which these motifs appear, including flanking sequences, global amino acid composition, and PTM status, is critical for determining binding specificity.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A multi-modal deep learning model, trained on integrated data encompassing protein sequences, known interactions, structural contexts, and PTM sites, can learn the complex sequence features that govern IDP binding specificity with significantly higher fidelity than current motif-based or co-expression-based methods.\n*   **Prediction:** Our model, which we term 'IDP-BERT', will be able to distinguish true interaction partners from non-partners in a held-out test set with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) greater than 0.85. Furthermore, the model's attention mechanisms will highlight specific residues and regions ('stickers') critical for binding, recapitulating known short linear motifs (SLiMs) and discovering novel ones.\n*   **Validation:** We will validate predictions against a manually curated benchmark dataset of high-confidence, experimentally verified IDP interactions not included in the training data. We will perform *in silico* saturation mutagenesis on well-characterized IDP interaction pairs (e.g., p53-MDM2) to test if our model correctly predicts the loss or gain of function associated with known mutations.\n\n**Research Question 2: How do sequence-encoded features and PTMs collectively determine an IDP's propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form biomolecular condensates?**\nThis question links molecular interactions to the next level of organization: the formation of mesoscale assemblies. We posit that the same sequence grammar that dictates one-on-one interactions also governs the multivalent interactions driving LLPS.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** The features learned by IDP-BERT for specific binding can be leveraged in a multi-task learning framework to predict a protein's intrinsic propensity to phase separate. The model will learn how the distribution, type, and PTM-state of 'stickers' across the sequence collectively determine the valency and interaction strength required for LLPS.\n*   **Prediction:** The model will accurately classify proteins from curated LLPS databases (e.g., PhaSepDB) with high precision and recall. It will also predict the direction of change in LLPS propensity upon specific PTMs, such as predicting that phosphorylation of FUS's low-complexity domain will decrease its tendency to phase separate, consistent with experimental observations.\n*   **Validation:** We will systematically compare our model's LLPS propensity scores against experimental data from the literature, including saturation concentrations and phase diagrams for a set of well-studied proteins (e.g., FUS, TDP-43, LAF-1). We will also test its ability to predict the effects of known ALS-associated mutations on the phase behavior of FUS.\n\n**Research Question 3: Can sequence-level predictions be systematically bridged to predict the emergent, physical material properties of IDP-driven condensates?**\nThis is the most ambitious question, aiming to connect our predictive model to the principles of polymer physics to understand the emergent behavior of the cell. The 'fuzziness' of IDP interactions leads to condensates with diverse material states, from dynamic liquids to viscous gels, and we hypothesize this is predictable.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The interaction probabilities and binding site locations predicted by IDP-BERT can be directly translated into effective interaction parameters for coarse-grained molecular simulations, enabling the prediction of mesoscale properties like condensate viscosity, surface tension, and internal component dynamics.\n*   **Prediction:** Simulations parameterized by our model will recapitulate known differences in material properties between different MLOs. For example, simulations of P-granule components will yield condensates with higher fluidity (lower viscosity) than simulations of stress granule components.\n*   **Validation:** We will compare quantitative outputs from our simulations (e.g., diffusion coefficients, droplet fusion timescales) with experimental measurements from public datasets and literature, such as data from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We will validate that our simulation pipeline can reproduce the experimentally observed impact of changing salt concentration or temperature on condensate stability.\n\n**Expected Deliverables:** The project will yield: (1) A publicly available, integrated, and version-controlled database of IDP features. (2) The open-source code for the IDP-BERT model and all training pipelines. (3) A user-friendly web server for the community to analyze their proteins of interest. (4) A validated pipeline for parameterizing coarse-grained simulations from model outputs.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our research plan is structured into three synergistic aims that integrate data curation, machine learning model development, and biophysical simulation. This transdisciplinary approach is essential to bridge the scales from primary sequence to emergent cellular function. The entire project will adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles for data and open science practices for software.\n\n**Aim 1: Assemble a Large-Scale, Multi-Modal Integrated Data Resource for IDP Function.**\nThis foundational aim focuses on aggregating and harmonizing diverse public datasets into a unified resource suitable for training a sophisticated deep learning model. This task requires significant bioinformatic expertise and is critical for the project's success.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will synthesize data from a comprehensive list of public repositories. \n    *   **Sequence and Disorder Annotations:** Protein sequences will be sourced from UniProt (Swiss-Prot). Experimentally validated disordered regions will be extracted from DisProt and MobiDB. Computationally predicted disorder scores from multiple algorithms (e.g., IUPred2A, Espritz) will be included as input features.\n    *   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** High-confidence physical interactions will be aggregated from BioGRID, IntAct, and STRING. We will use stringent filtering criteria, retaining only interactions supported by at least two independent experiments or those from manually curated datasets to minimize noise.\n    *   **Structural Context:** For IDPs that form complexes with structured proteins, we will extract atomic coordinates from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For all proteins, we will use the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database to obtain high-quality structural models of any folded domains flanking or embedded within IDRs.\n    *   **Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs):** Experimentally verified PTM sites (e.g., phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation) will be sourced from PhosphoSitePlus, dbPTM, and recent large-scale proteomics studies. We will map these sites precisely onto our canonical UniProt sequences.\n    *   **Phase Separation Data:** A ground-truth dataset of phase-separating proteins will be compiled from specialized databases like PhaSepDB, DrLLPS, and PhaSePro, along with manual curation from the literature.\n*   **Data Integration and Preprocessing:** A robust pipeline using Python (Biopython, Pandas) and custom scripts will be developed to process and integrate these data. All entries will be mapped to unique UniProtKB identifiers. The final integrated dataset will be structured as a graph, where nodes represent proteins and their attributes (sequence, disorder, PTMs) and edges represent interactions. This resource will be version-controlled and made publicly available via Zenodo.\n\n**Aim 2: Develop, Train, and Validate 'IDP-BERT', a Transformer-Based Model for Predicting IDP Interactomes and Phase Behavior.**\nThis aim constitutes the core computational modeling effort of the project.\n*   **Model Architecture:** We will build upon the Transformer architecture, which has proven highly effective for sequential data. Our model, 'IDP-BERT', will take a protein's amino acid sequence as input. We will develop a custom tokenization scheme that represents not only the 20 standard amino acids but also incorporates information about PTMs at specific sites. This allows the model to learn how modifications like phosphorylation alter the 'meaning' of a sequence.\n*   **Training Strategy:** We will employ a two-stage training process.\n    1.  **Self-Supervised Pre-training:** The model will first be pre-trained on the entire human proteome from UniProt. Using a masked language model objective, it will learn the fundamental statistical patterns and long-range dependencies inherent in protein sequences, creating powerful, context-aware embeddings for each amino acid.\n    2.  **Supervised Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model will then be fine-tuned on our integrated dataset from Aim 1 using a multi-task learning approach. The model will have multiple output 'heads', each trained for a specific task: a) an **Interaction Head** that predicts the probability of interaction between two proteins; b) an **LLPS Head** that predicts the propensity of a single protein to phase separate; and c) a **Binding Site Head** that predicts which specific residues are likely to mediate interactions. This multi-task setup allows the model to learn a shared representation that captures the underlying principles common to both specific binding and multivalent phase separation.\n*   **Validation and Interpretation:** The model will be rigorously validated using k-fold cross-validation and on held-out test sets. We will analyze the model's internal attention weights to interpret its predictions, identifying the sequence motifs and long-range contacts it deems important. This will provide novel biological insights into the 'rules' of IDP interactions.\n\n**Aim 3: Bridge Sequence-Level Predictions to Mesoscale Simulations of Condensate Material Properties.**\nThis aim connects the machine learning predictions to physical models to explore emergent properties.\n*   **Simulation Parameterization:** We will develop a pipeline to translate the outputs of IDP-BERT into parameters for coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations. The predicted interaction probabilities between different sequence regions ('stickers') will be converted into effective pairwise interaction energies in a CG model (e.g., a 'stickers-and-spacers' representation).\n*   **Simulation Engine:** We will utilize highly efficient, open-source simulation packages designed for polymer physics and phase separation, such as LaSSI or HOOMD-blue, running on GPU-accelerated hardware.\n*   **Analysis of Emergent Properties:** We will run large-scale simulations of single- and multi-component systems to predict phase diagrams as a function of protein concentration and other variables. By analyzing the simulation trajectories, we will calculate key material properties, including condensate density, surface tension, and viscosity (via Green-Kubo relations), and the diffusion rates of molecules within the condensate.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of the integrated data resource (M6). Development and pre-training of the first IDP-BERT prototype (M9). Initial fine-tuning and validation for PPI prediction (M12).\n*   **Year 2:** Full multi-task model development, including LLPS and PTM effects (M18). Establishment of the simulation parameterization pipeline (M21).

Development and deployment of the public web server (M33). Submission of manuscripts and release of all data and software (M36).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of molecular and cellular biology, biophysics, and computational biology.

The impact will be felt across basic science, translational medicine, and biotechnology.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Unified Predictive Tool for IDP Function:** The primary outcome will be 'IDP-BERT', a powerful, open-source computational tool and web server. For the first time, researchers will be able to input an amino acid sequence and receive a comprehensive functional prediction, including likely interaction partners, propensity for phase separation, key functional sites, and the probable impact of PTMs. This will democratize the study of IDPs, making sophisticated computational analysis accessible to the entire biological community.\n2.  **Deciphering the 'Molecular Grammar' of IDPs:** Our work will provide fundamental insights into the sequence-encoded rules that govern IDP interactions. By interpreting the features learned by our model, we expect to discover novel interaction motifs (SLiMs) and uncover the complex interplay between local motifs and global sequence context. This will provide a new 'dictionary' for understanding how information is encoded in the disordered proteome.\n3.  **A Quantitative Bridge Between Sequence and Mesoscale Physics:** The project will establish a novel, validated workflow for connecting sequence-level information to the emergent material properties of biomolecular condensates. This will provide a powerful *in silico* microscope to explore how mutations or PTMs alter the liquidity, viscosity, and dynamics of membraneless organelles, offering mechanistic explanations for their function and dysfunction.\n4.  **A Rich, Integrated Data Resource:** The curated, multimodal dataset assembled in Aim 1 will be a valuable community resource in its own right. By harmonizing data from disparate sources, we will provide a high-quality, benchmark dataset that can be used by other groups to develop and test new computational methods.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Translational Medicine and Disease:** The ability to predict the functional consequences of mutations in disordered regions has profound clinical implications. Our tool can be used to rapidly assess the pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance (VUS) found in patient genomes, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., ALS, Alzheimer's) and cancers where IDPs are frequently mutated. This can accelerate diagnostics and guide the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating IDP interactions or phase behavior.\n*   **Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** A predictive understanding of IDP grammar will empower the rational design of novel proteins.

All software will be developed under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT) and hosted on GitHub. The trained models and the integrated dataset will be deposited in public repositories like Zenodo and Model Zoo. We will develop a user-friendly web server to ensure broad accessibility of our predictive tool. Our findings will be disseminated through high-impact, open-access publications in journals such as *Nature Methods*, *Cell Systems*, or *PNAS*, and through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., ISMB, ASCB, BPS). We will also organize a workshop in the final year to train other researchers in the use of our tools and methods.\n\n**Long-Term Vision:** This project lays the groundwork for a long-term vision of creating a 'virtual cell' where the emergent organization of the cytoplasm can be predicted from genomic information. Future iterations could incorporate cellular localization data, RNA interactions, and metabolic information to build an increasingly comprehensive model of cellular life. This work will fundamentally change our ability to interpret genomes, moving from a list of parts to a dynamic blueprint of the living cell.",

        "background_and_significance": "The emergence of complex multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors is one of the most profound and consequential transitions in the history of life. This evolutionary leap, which occurred independently in at least six eukaryotic lineages including animals, plants, and fungi, enabled the evolution of macroscopic life and the vast ecological complexity we observe today. A central, unanswered question in biology is whether these independent origins of multicellularity followed convergent evolutionary paths governed by universal principles. While the specific genes and proteins involved—the 'hardware'—differ between lineages, we hypothesize that the underlying 'software'—the logic and architecture of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control cell differentiation, communication, and spatial organization—may exhibit deep homologies or convergent features. Understanding this regulatory grammar is fundamental to explaining how emergent complexity arises from a finite set of genetic components. \n\nCurrent research, largely from the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), has provided critical foundational insights. Studies on the unicellular relatives of animals, such as choanoflagellates, have revealed that a significant portion of the 'developmental toolkit' genes—including transcription factors, signaling pathway components, and adhesion molecules—were already present in their single-celled ancestors (King et al., 2008; Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2017). This seminal discovery shifted the focus from the origin of new genes to the rewiring of pre-existing regulatory connections as the primary driver of multicellular innovation. Similarly, comparative genomics in plants and fungi has shown that unicellular algae and fungi possess orthologs of key regulators of multicellular development (e.g., MADS-box genes in plants). These findings strongly imply that the transition to multicellularity was primarily a problem of information processing and network engineering.\n\nSystems biology has provided the conceptual framework for studying GRNs as complex networks. Detailed GRN models have been painstakingly constructed for specific developmental processes in model organisms like the sea urchin endomesoderm (Davidson et al., 2002) and Drosophila segmentation (Jaeger et al., 2004). These studies demonstrate how network architecture gives rise to precise spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and robust developmental outcomes. However, these efforts have been largely confined to single species or closely related groups, providing limited insight into the macroevolutionary patterns of GRN evolution across deep time.\n\nThis leaves a critical gap in our knowledge. We lack a systematic, cross-kingdom comparative analysis of GRNs. Previous comparative studies have been limited in phylogenetic scope or have focused on the evolution of individual transcription factors or small motifs rather than whole-network architectures. Furthermore, the methods used to infer GRNs are diverse and often not directly comparable, creating a methodological fragmentation that has prevented a unified synthesis. The sheer scale of the data required—integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics from dozens of species—and the analytical complexity of comparing large, heterogeneous networks have placed such a project beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory. \n\nThis project is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the explosion of publicly available data, including hundreds of high-quality genomes and vast repositories of transcriptomic (e.g., SRA, GEO) and epigenomic (e.g., ENCODE) data, makes a large-scale synthesis project feasible for the first time. The recent advent of single-cell atlases provides unprecedented resolution into the cell-type-specific regulatory states that define multicellularity. Second, advances in computational biology, including machine learning algorithms for network inference and novel analytical tools from network science and topological data analysis, provide the necessary power to extract meaningful patterns from this data deluge. By uniting a multidisciplinary team of experts to tackle this challenge, we can move beyond species-specific descriptions to uncover the fundamental, and potentially universal, principles of regulatory logic that enabled one of life's greatest innovations.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is guided by the overarching question: Are there universal architectural principles and dynamic properties of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) that convergently evolved to enable the transition from unicellular to complex multicellular life? To deconstruct this central question, we have formulated four specific, interconnected research questions (RQs), each associated with a set of testable hypotheses and clear, falsifiable predictions.\n\n**RQ1: How did the global architecture and topology of GRNs change during the transition to multicellularity?**\nThis question addresses the macro-level structural changes in GRNs. We hypothesize that the demands of coordinating multiple cell types in a stable body plan imposed strong selection for more complex and organized network structures.\n*   **Hypothesis 1 (The Hierarchy and Modularity Hypothesis):** The evolution of multicellularity is consistently associated with an increase in both the hierarchical organization and modularity of GRNs.\n    *   *Prediction 1a:* Using network metrics, we will find that GRNs from multicellular organisms exhibit significantly higher global reaching centrality and a more layered, acyclic structure compared to their unicellular sister taxa. This reflects the emergence of master regulators controlling downstream developmental cascades.\n    *   *Prediction 1b:* We predict that multicellular GRNs will have a higher modularity score, with identified modules corresponding to distinct cell-type-specific or tissue-specific developmental programs. We will test this by assessing the functional enrichment (GO terms) of genes within computationally defined network modules.\n\n**RQ2: Are specific, functional network motifs convergently acquired or enriched in independent multicellular lineages?**\nThis question focuses on the micro-level circuitry of GRNs. We posit that certain computational tasks essential for multicellularity, such as robust cell fate decisions and noise filtering, are solved by a limited set of optimal network motifs.\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (The Convergent Motif Hypothesis):** Network motifs that function as bistable switches, oscillators, and noise-dampening filters are significantly and convergently enriched in the GRNs of multicellular organisms.\n    *   *Prediction 2a:* A systematic search will reveal a statistically significant over-representation of motifs like the toggle switch (two mutually repressing genes) and the coherent feed-forward loop (FFL) in all analyzed multicellular lineages (animals, plants, fungi) relative to their unicellular relatives.\n    *   *Prediction 2b:* The genes participating in these enriched motifs will be disproportionately involved in cell fate specification, cell cycle control, and intercellular signaling pathways, as determined by functional annotation.\n\n**RQ3: How do the potential dynamic properties of GRNs differ between unicellular and multicellular organisms?**\nThis question moves from static network structure to the functional consequences for cellular behavior. We hypothesize that multicellular GRNs are structured to support a larger and more stable repertoire of cellular states.\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (The Expanded Attractor Landscape Hypothesis):** GRNs from multicellular organisms possess a richer landscape of stable states (attractors), corresponding to distinct cell types, compared to the simpler landscapes of their unicellular ancestors.\n    *   *Prediction 3a:* Using Boolean network modeling on core regulatory sub-networks, we will find that multicellular GRNs have a significantly larger number of stable point attractors and stable cyclic attractors than unicellular GRNs.\n    *   *Prediction 3b:* The attractors identified in our models will correspond to known cell-type-specific gene expression profiles derived from single-cell RNA-seq data, validating their biological relevance. The transitions between these attractors will require specific input signals, mirroring developmental signaling pathways.\n\n**RQ4: What are the genomic and epigenomic correlates of the evolutionary transition to multicellular GRN architectures?**\nThis question links network evolution to changes in the genome itself. We propose that network rewiring is scaffolded by specific changes in the genetic toolkit and the regulatory landscape.\n*   **Hypothesis 4 (The Regulatory Scaffolding Hypothesis):** The emergence of complex multicellular GRNs is preceded or accompanied by the expansion of specific transcription factor (TF) families and an increase in the complexity of the cis-regulatory landscape.\n    *   *Prediction 4a:* Phylogenetic analysis will show that major expansions of lineage-specific TF families (e.g., bHLH, Homeobox in animals; MADS-box in plants) correlate tightly with the phylogenetic nodes where multicellularity arose.\n    *   *Prediction 4b:* These expanded TF families will be identified as key hub nodes in the multicellular GRNs. Furthermore, we predict a significant increase in the density of conserved non-coding elements (potential cis-regulatory sites) and regions of open chromatin (from ATAC-seq data) in the genomes of multicellular organisms compared to their unicellular relatives.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed in four integrated phases by a transdisciplinary working group with expertise spanning evolutionary biology, network science, computational biology, and data science. Our approach is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and open, leveraging only publicly available data as stipulated by the research call.\n\n**Phase 1: Community-Scale Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**\nThis foundational phase addresses the critical challenge of integrating vast and heterogeneous public datasets.\n*   **Species Selection:** We will select a phylogenetically balanced set of approximately 50 species, capturing at least five independent origins of multicellularity (Metazoa, Land Plants, Florideophyte red algae, and two fungal lineages). For each origin, we will sample a triad of species: a unicellular outgroup, a simple multicellular relative, and a complex multicellular organism (e.g., *Monosiga brevicollis* -> *Amphimedon queenslandica* -> *Drosophila melanogaster*). This comparative phylogenetic framework is essential for inferring the direction of evolutionary change.\n*   **Data Aggregation:** We will systematically mine major public repositories, including NCBI (genomes, SRA), EBI (ArrayExpress, Expression Atlas), and ENCODE/modENCODE. We will prioritize species with high-quality genome assemblies, annotations, and extensive transcriptomic (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq for histone marks) data.\n*   **Standardized Processing Pipeline:** To ensure comparability across species, all raw data will be processed through a single, harmonized pipeline. This pipeline, built using Nextflow for scalability and portability, and containerized with Docker/Singularity for reproducibility, will perform tasks such as: uniform quality control of sequencing reads, mapping to reference genomes, transcript quantification (e.g., Salmon), and peak calling for epigenomic data (e.g., MACS2). All processed data and metadata will be stored in a centralized, versioned repository.\n\n**Phase 2: Multi-Modal Gene Regulatory Network Inference (Months 6-18)**\nRecognizing that no single GRN inference algorithm is infallible, we will employ an ensemble, integrative approach to generate a consensus, high-confidence network for each species.\n*   **Inference Methods:** Our pipeline will integrate three distinct lines of evidence:\n    1.  **Expression-based inference:** We will use mutual information-based methods (e.g., ARACNe, GENIE3) and Bayesian network models to infer regulatory relationships from large compilations of gene expression data.\n    2.  **Sequence-based inference:** We will perform genome-wide scans for transcription factor binding motifs (using databases like JASPAR and CIS-BP) in promoter and enhancer regions (identified via chromatin accessibility data) to predict physical TF-target gene interactions.\n    3.  **Chromatin-based inference:** We will leverage ATAC-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq data to identify active regulatory elements and link them to target genes based on proximity and chromatin conformation data (where available), thus refining the set of potential regulatory interactions.\n*   **Network Integration and Validation:** The outputs of these methods will be integrated using a weighted scoring scheme to produce a final, confidence-scored GRN for each species. The pipeline's performance and scoring thresholds will be calibrated by benchmarking against gold-standard, experimentally validated GRNs from model organisms like *E. coli*, *S. cerevisiae*, and *D. melanogaster*.\n\n**Phase 3: Comparative Network Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Months 15-30)**\nThis phase constitutes the core scientific inquiry of the project.\n*   **Topological Analysis (RQ1, H1):** We will compute a suite of global and local network metrics for all 50 GRNs using libraries like NetworkX and igraph. We will use Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) to test for statistically significant correlations between network properties (e.g., modularity, hierarchy) and the presence of multicellularity, while controlling for phylogenetic non-independence.\n*   **Motif Analysis (RQ2, H2):** We will use specialized algorithms (e.g., FANMOD) to determine the statistical significance (Z-score) of all 3- and 4-node motifs in each network compared to a null model. We will then compare motif significance profiles across the phylogenetic tree to identify convergently enriched motifs.\n*   **Dynamical Modeling (RQ3, H3):** For key sub-networks involved in cell fate decisions, we will construct and analyze Boolean network models. By simulating the network dynamics, we will identify the number and characteristics of their attractors (stable states). We will test if the number of attractors correlates with the number of cell types in the organism.\n*   **Innovative Approaches:** We will employ Topological Data Analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology, to capture higher-order structural features of the GRNs. This novel approach may reveal complex organizational principles (e.g., loops, voids in network space) that are invisible to standard metrics and may be signatures of multicellularity.\n\n**Phase 4: Resource Dissemination and Community Training (Months 24-36)**\n*   **The GRN-Zoo:** We will develop and launch a public, web-accessible database, the 'GRN-Zoo'. This resource will feature an intuitive interface for browsing, searching, visualizing (using Cytoscape.js), and downloading all inferred GRNs, associated metadata, and analysis results. It will serve as a lasting contribution to the scientific community.\n*   **Open Science Commitment:** All analysis scripts, workflows, and pipelines will be open-source and available on GitHub. All data products will be deposited in public repositories like Zenodo. We will publish our findings in open-access journals.\n*   **Timeline and Milestones:**\n    *   Year 1: Data curation for all species complete. GRN inference pipeline v1.0 deployed. Pilot GRNs for 10 species reconstructed and analyzed.\n    *   Year 2: All 50 GRNs reconstructed. Comparative analysis framework finalized. GRN-Zoo beta version launched. First major manuscript submitted.\n    *   Year 3: In-depth hypothesis testing, including dynamical modeling and TDA, completed. GRN-Zoo public release with full functionality. Final manuscripts submitted. Host first community training workshop.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This community-scale synthesis project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes, significantly advancing the fields of evolutionary, developmental, and systems biology. The impact will be felt through the generation of fundamental new knowledge, the creation of a lasting community resource, the development of novel analytical strategies, and the training of a new generation of data-savvy biologists.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **Discovery of Universal Principles of Biological Emergence:** The primary intellectual contribution will be the identification of a core set of principles—a 'regulatory grammar'—that govern the evolution of multicellularity. By moving beyond the specifics of individual lineages, we aim to uncover the convergent logic that enables the emergence of complex biological form and function. This would represent a major step towards a predictive theory of developmental evolution and would directly address the funding call's focus on emergence phenomena.\n2.  **A Foundational Community Resource: The GRN-Zoo:** We will deliver the first large-scale, cross-kingdom comparative atlas of gene regulatory networks. The 'GRN-Zoo' database and visualization platform will be a durable resource for the entire biological community, analogous to how GenBank or the Protein Data Bank have catalyzed research. It will empower countless new investigations by enabling researchers to easily query and compare regulatory architectures across the tree of life, ask new questions, and formulate novel hypotheses.\n3.  **Methodological Advancement and Standardization:** Our project will produce and disseminate a robust, reproducible, and open-source computational pipeline for integrating diverse 'omics' data to infer and compare GRNs. This standardized framework will help overcome the methodological fragmentation in the field, promoting higher standards of rigor and comparability in future systems biology research.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Informing Synthetic Biology:** The design principles we uncover will provide a blueprint for the forward engineering of synthetic multicellular systems. Understanding how nature builds robust, complex systems can guide the creation of engineered tissues for regenerative medicine, programmable microbial consortia for bioremediation, and sophisticated cellular circuits for bioproduction.\n*   **New Perspectives on Disease:** Many human diseases, most notably cancer, can be conceptualized as a breakdown of the regulatory programs that maintain multicellular cooperation. Cancer cells often reactivate ancestral unicellular behaviors like proliferation and migration. Our research into the GRNs that stabilize multicellularity could reveal network-level vulnerabilities and identify novel therapeutic targets aimed at reinforcing the 'multicellular contract'.\n*   **Advancing STEM Education and Training:** This project is intrinsically multidisciplinary and will serve as an exceptional training environment. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will gain unique expertise at the intersection of evolutionary biology, computational science, and network theory. Through our planned annual workshops, we will disseminate these skills to the broader community, directly contributing to the development of the future data-savvy workforce as mandated by the research call.\n\n**Dissemination Plan and Long-Term Vision:**\nOur dissemination strategy is multi-faceted. We will publish our primary findings in high-impact, open-access journals such as *Nature*, *Science*, or *Cell*, with more specialized methodological and analytical papers submitted to journals like *PLoS Computational Biology* and *Molecular Biology and Evolution*. We will actively present our work at major international conferences (e.g., ISMB, SMBE, SDB) to engage with the community. The GRN-Zoo will be the central hub for dissemination, providing open access to all data and results. Our long-term vision is for the GRN-Zoo to become a living database, sustained by follow-on funding and community contributions. The working group established by this project will form the nucleus of a durable collaborative network, fostering future projects that build upon this foundational work to incorporate new data types like spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, further unraveling the emergent logic of life.",

        "background_and_significance": "The living cell is a quintessential complex adaptive system. Its state is defined by an intricate, multi-layered network of interactions between genes, proteins, and other molecules. The response of this system to perturbations—be it a therapeutic drug, a disease-causing mutation, or an environmental stressor—is an emergent phenomenon that is notoriously difficult to predict. This predictive challenge represents a fundamental bottleneck in virtually every aspect of modern biology and medicine, from designing effective cancer therapies to understanding the mechanisms of genetic disorders. For decades, the dominant paradigm for studying cellular responses has been reductionist, focusing on individual pathways or a handful of molecules. While invaluable, this approach struggles to capture the system-level properties that govern cellular behavior. The advent of high-throughput omics technologies has enabled a more holistic view, generating vast datasets that profile cellular states at unprecedented resolution. Landmark public resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS L1000), the Dependency Map (DepMap), and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) now house millions of molecular profiles of cells under a wide array of chemical and genetic perturbations. These datasets represent a monumental community achievement and an unparalleled resource for understanding cellular logic. However, they remain largely fragmented and underutilized. Current computational approaches to model this data are often limited in scope. Mechanistic models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can provide deep insights but are restricted to well-characterized pathways and do not scale to the genome level. Conversely, statistical and machine learning models have shown promise in specific tasks, such as predicting drug sensitivity from baseline gene expression. Yet, these models are typically trained on a single data modality for a single predictive task (e.g., predicting cell viability). They often lack generalizability across different cell types, perturbation classes, or molecular readouts. A key gap in the field is the absence of a unified framework that can integrate these disparate, multi-modal datasets to learn a general, transferable model of cellular response. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly the development of 'foundational models' in natural language processing (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) and computer vision, offer a new paradigm. These models are pre-trained on massive, diverse datasets using self-supervised objectives and learn powerful, general-purpose representations that can be adapted to a multitude of downstream tasks. The application of this paradigm to molecular and cellular biology is both timely and transformative. Early efforts have demonstrated the potential of deep learning to predict single-cell transcriptomic responses to perturbations (Lotfollahi et al., 2022), but these have been limited to a single data modality and a narrow set of perturbations. This project, CellStateNet, proposes to take a quantum leap forward. We will be the first to construct a true foundational model for cellular biology by integrating the world's public perturbation-response data across transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional genomics. The importance of this research cannot be overstated. Such a model would function as a universal 'in-silico cell,' allowing researchers to perform virtual experiments at a scale and speed unattainable in the laboratory. It would enable the systematic exploration of the vast combinatorial space of drug mixtures, the functional interpretation of uncharacterized genetic variants, and the deconvolution of complex disease mechanisms. The sheer scale of the data integration effort, the computational complexity of training a multi-modal foundational model, and the transdisciplinary expertise required—spanning machine learning, bioinformatics, systems biology, and pharmacology—place this project far beyond the capacity of any single research lab. It is precisely the type of community-scale synthesis project that this research call is designed to catalyze, promising to create a public resource that will empower the entire biomedical research community and accelerate the pace of discovery for years to come.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is guided by a central, ambitious question: Can a single, unified computational model learn the fundamental 'rules' of cellular response by integrating the full breadth of public, multi-modal perturbation data? To address this, we have formulated three specific research questions (RQs), each with testable hypotheses that will structure our investigation. \n\n**RQ1: Can a multi-modal deep learning architecture learn a shared, biologically meaningful latent representation of cellular state that is predictive across diverse omics layers and perturbation types?**\nThe central premise of CellStateNet is that a unified representation of cellular state exists and can be learned from data. This latent space should capture the underlying biological processes that are perturbed, regardless of whether the perturbation is chemical or genetic, or whether the readout is transcriptomic or proteomic.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A self-supervised model, trained on the cross-modal task of predicting the proteomic state of a cell from its transcriptomic state (and vice versa) under a given perturbation, will learn a latent space whose dimensions are significantly enriched for canonical biological pathways and gene ontology terms. \n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** The latent embeddings of perturbations learned by the model will cluster according to their known mechanism of action (MoA), demonstrating that the model captures functional similarities between distinct chemical and genetic interventions.\n*   **Hypothesis 1c:** A multi-modal model will outperform single-modality autoencoders in downstream predictive tasks, as the integration of multiple data types provides a more constrained and robust representation of cellular state.\n*   **Validation:** We will test H1a by performing systematic enrichment analyses (e.g., GSEA) on genes highly weighted in each latent dimension. For H1b, we will use clustering metrics (e.g., silhouette score) to quantify the separation of perturbations by MoA in the learned embedding space. For H1c, we will establish a suite of benchmark tasks (e.g., predicting cell viability) and compare the performance of CellStateNet's representations against those from models trained on transcriptomics or proteomics alone.\n\n**RQ2: Can the trained CellStateNet model accurately predict the molecular and phenotypic outcomes of unseen perturbations, including novel drug combinations and uncharacterized genetic variants?**\nA truly foundational model must possess predictive power beyond its training data, demonstrating true generalization. We will rigorously test the model's ability to make *de novo* predictions for perturbations it has not seen during training.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** CellStateNet can predict the full transcriptomic profile of a cell's response to a combination of two drugs, given only data on the effects of each drug individually. The model's predictions will accurately classify the interaction as synergistic, additive, or antagonistic when compared to experimental ground truth.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The model can predict the phenotypic consequences (e.g., cell fitness score from DepMap) of introducing an uncharacterized, non-coding genetic variant by first predicting its impact on the expression of nearby genes and then propagating this molecular change through the model to a final phenotype.\n*   **Validation:** For H2a, we will employ a temporal hold-out strategy, training the model on public data up to a specific year and testing its ability to predict the results of combination screens published subsequently. We will compare predicted gene expression vectors using cosine similarity and correlation, and synergy scores using established metrics. For H2b, we will leverage data from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and variant effect mapping studies (e.g., MaveDB) as ground truth, assessing the correlation between our model's predicted fitness effects and experimentally measured ones for held-out variants.\n\n**RQ3: Can CellStateNet function as an *in silico* discovery engine to generate novel, testable hypotheses about synergistic therapeutic strategies and key drivers of cellular state transitions?**\nThe ultimate utility of CellStateNet lies in its application as a tool for scientific discovery. We will use the trained model to probe complex biological systems and generate high-priority hypotheses for experimental validation.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** An *in silico* screen using CellStateNet across millions of virtual compound pairs against a specific cancer cell line model will identify novel synergistic combinations at a rate significantly higher than random chance.\n*   **Hypothesis 3b:** Model interpretability techniques (e.g., integrated gradients, attention analysis) applied to the model's prediction of a transition from a healthy to a diseased cellular state can identify key genes and pathways that act as critical drivers of the transition.\n*   **Validation:** For H3a, we will generate a ranked list of predicted synergistic pairs for a well-studied cancer model (e.g., MCF-7 breast cancer) and assess the enrichment of known synergies and plausible biological mechanisms in the top predictions by cross-referencing literature and pathway databases. For H3b, we will simulate a disease transition (e.g., oncogenic transformation) and compare the model-identified driver genes with known oncogenes and tumor suppressors from databases like COSMIC, testing for significant overlap.\n\n**Expected Deliverables:** This research will produce: (1) A comprehensive, harmonized, and analysis-ready database of public perturbation-response data. (2) The open-source code for the CellStateNet model architecture and training pipeline. (3) The pre-trained CellStateNet model weights. (4) A user-friendly web portal and API for querying the model. (5) A series of high-impact publications detailing the model and its applications.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our methodology is structured into three synergistic aims, designed to create a robust, validated, and accessible foundational model. This project is exclusively computational and will synthesize existing public data, aligning perfectly with the research call.\n\n**Aim 1: Community-Scale Data Aggregation, Harmonization, and Curation.**\nThis foundational aim addresses the critical challenge of data fragmentation. Our working group will develop a scalable, reproducible pipeline to process and unify the world's major cellular perturbation datasets.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will integrate data from multiple modalities: \n    *   **Transcriptomics:** The LINCS L1000 dataset (~1.3M profiles of ~20,000 small molecules and ~20,000 genetic perturbations across ~100 cell lines) will form the core. We will supplement this with curated, large-scale perturbation studies from GEO and ArrayExpress, including single-cell datasets (e.g., sci-Plex, Perturb-seq) to capture cell-to-cell heterogeneity.\n    *   **Functional Genomics:** Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens from the DepMap and Achilles projects, providing fitness data for ~18,000 gene knockouts across >1000 cancer cell lines.\n    *   **Proteomics & Phosphoproteomics:** Datasets from CPTAC detailing proteomic changes in response to drugs in cancer cell lines, and relevant studies from the PRIDE repository.\n    *   **Epigenomics:** We will incorporate ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE and GEO that profile chromatin accessibility and histone modifications following specific perturbations, providing another layer of cellular state information.\n*   **Harmonization and Curation Pipeline:** This is a major undertaking requiring diverse expertise. (1) **Standardized Metadata:** We will develop a unified schema to capture critical metadata, mapping cell lines to Cellosaurus IDs, chemical compounds to PubChem/ChEMBL IDs, and genes/proteins to Ensembl/HGNC/UniProt IDs. (2) **Standardized Data Processing:** We will create and publish containerized (e.g., Docker/Singularity) workflows for processing each data type from its raw form to an analysis-ready matrix, ensuring reproducibility. For example, RNA-seq data will be uniformly processed through a Kallisto/STAR pipeline. (3) **Quality Control:** Automated QC metrics will be implemented to flag and potentially exclude low-quality samples, and computational methods like ComBat will be used to mitigate batch effects where appropriate. (4) **Unified Data Structure:** The final output will be a single, cohesive data object (e.g., stored in HDF5 or Zarr format) containing all data modalities and metadata, ready for model training.\n\n**Aim 2: Development and Training of the CellStateNet Foundational Model.**\nThis aim constitutes the core technical innovation of the project.\n*   **Model Architecture:** CellStateNet will be a multi-modal, deep generative model. Its architecture will consist of three main components:\n    1.  **Modality-Specific Encoders:** Each data type (transcriptome, proteome, etc.) will be fed into a dedicated encoder (e.g., a Transformer or a Residual Network) that learns to project the high-dimensional input into a common, lower-dimensional latent space.\n    2.  **Perturbation Encoder:** Perturbations will be encoded into the same latent space. Small molecules will be represented by their graph structure using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), while genetic perturbations will be represented by learned embeddings for each gene.\n    3.  **Integration Core:** A central cross-attention-based Transformer will form the core of the model. It will take the latent representation of the baseline cellular state and the perturbation embedding as input and predict the latent representation of the post-perturbation state. This predicted latent state is then passed to modality-specific decoders to generate the final molecular profiles.\n*   **Self-Supervised Training:** The model will be trained on a multi-faceted, self-supervised objective function without requiring labeled data. The primary task will be **cross-modal prediction**: given a cell's baseline state and a perturbation, the model will be trained to predict the post-perturbation state in one modality (e.g., proteomics) using the post-perturbation state from another modality (e.g., transcriptomics) as input. This forces the model to learn the intricate relationships between different molecular layers. We will supplement this with a contrastive loss to ensure that similar perturbations result in similar latent space trajectories.\n*   **Computational Scale:** Training a model of this complexity on terabytes of data is computationally intensive and requires resources beyond a single lab. We will leverage national HPC resources or cloud computing platforms, requiring an estimated 500,000 GPU-hours on NVIDIA A100 or equivalent hardware. This demonstrates a clear need for NCEMS support.\n\n**Aim 3: Rigorous Model Validation and Application for Hypothesis Generation.**\n*   **Validation Strategy:** We will employ a multi-pronged validation approach. **Intrinsic validation** will assess the model's accuracy on its self-supervised training objectives using a held-out test set of perturbations and cell lines. **Extrinsic validation** will evaluate the model's performance on a series of predefined downstream tasks that it was not explicitly trained on, as detailed in RQ2. This includes predicting drug synergy, forecasting variant effects, and classifying drug mechanism-of-action.\n*   **Application Case Studies:** To demonstrate the model's utility, we will conduct two in-depth case studies: (1) **Oncology:** We will perform a large-scale *in silico* screen for synergistic drug combinations to overcome resistance to KRAS inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma models. (2) **Genetic Disease:** We will predict the molecular consequences of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) in the CFTR gene, aiming to stratify them by their likely functional impact and identify potential patient-specific therapeutic avenues.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Finalize data sources; build and execute the data harmonization pipeline (Deliverable: Harmonized dataset v1.0). Develop and benchmark prototype model architectures.\n*   **Year 2:** Complete the first full-scale training of CellStateNet v1.0. Perform intrinsic validation and begin extrinsic validation benchmarks. Develop the prototype web portal. (Deliverable: Pre-trained model v1.0 and associated open-source code).\n*   **Year 3:** Refine model architecture and retrain (v2.0) based on validation results. Complete all extrinsic validation and application case studies. Finalize and launch the public web portal. Disseminate results through publications and conference presentations. (Deliverable: Final model, web portal, and primary manuscript).",

We will move the field from a collection of bespoke, task-specific models to a single, general-purpose foundational model. This is analogous to the impact of models like AlphaFold and GPT-3 in their respective domains. \n1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of the Cell:** CellStateNet will be the first computational model to learn the relationships between diverse molecular layers (transcriptome, proteome, etc.) and perturbation types (chemical, genetic) from the ground up, using the entirety of the world's relevant public data. It will provide a quantitative, system-level framework for understanding how cellular networks process information and respond to stimuli.\n2.  **A Powerful Engine for Hypothesis Generation:** By enabling rapid, large-scale *in silico* experimentation, CellStateNet will dramatically accelerate the scientific discovery cycle. Biologists will be able to prioritize experiments, screen vast combinatorial spaces of perturbations that are experimentally intractable, and generate novel, data-driven hypotheses about disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.\n3.  **A Community-Wide Resource:** We are not just building a model; we are building an ecosystem. The project will deliver a meticulously harmonized database, a pre-trained model, open-source software, and an accessible web portal. This comprehensive suite of resources will empower researchers globally, regardless of their computational expertise, to leverage petabytes of public data to answer their own specific biological questions.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe impact of CellStateNet will extend far beyond basic science, with significant potential for translational and clinical applications.\n*   **Accelerating Therapeutic Development:** In pharmacology and drug discovery, CellStateNet can be used to predict the efficacy and off-target effects of novel compounds, identify synergistic drug combinations to combat drug resistance, and rationally design polypharmacology strategies. This could significantly reduce the cost and failure rate of preclinical drug development.\n*   **Enabling Precision Medicine:** The model can be conditioned on specific genetic backgrounds, allowing for personalized predictions of a patient's response to various therapies based on their tumor's mutational profile or their personal genome.

Methodological advancements and specific applications will be published in leading specialized journals (*Nature Methods*, *Nature Biotechnology*).\n*   **Open-Source Software:** All code for data processing, model training, and analysis will be version-controlled and hosted on GitHub under a permissive license (e.g., MIT).\n*   **Open Data and Models:** The complete, harmonized dataset will be deposited in a permanent public repository (e.g., Zenodo). The final pre-trained model weights and an easy-to-use Python API will be released to facilitate fine-tuning and downstream applications by the community.\n*   **Training and Outreach:** We will develop tutorials, documentation, and run workshops at major computational biology conferences (e.g., ISMB, RECOMB) to train the next generation of scientists in using CellStateNet. The creation of a public web portal is a key part of our strategy to ensure the model's accessibility to the entire biomedical community.\n\n**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**\nCellStateNet is envisioned not as a static, one-time product, but as a living resource for the community. The open-source framework we develop will be extensible, allowing for the future incorporation of new data modalities (e.g., metabolomics, spatial omics, high-content imaging) as they become widely available. The success of this project will establish a new standard for data synthesis in biology and will seed a vibrant ecosystem of follow-up research, where scientists around the world use, extend, and build upon our foundational model to probe countless biological questions.",

        "background_and_significance": "The cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of protein filaments—actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments—that permeates the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. This intricate scaffold is not static; it is an active, living material, constantly remodeled by a host of associated proteins, including molecular motors that generate force and cross-linkers that modulate network architecture. The emergent mechanical properties of this network govern fundamental cellular processes, from cell division and migration to mechanotransduction and tissue morphogenesis. A central challenge in cell biology is to understand how the collective interactions of these molecular components give rise to the robust, adaptable mechanical behavior observed at the cellular scale. For decades, research has largely followed two parallel tracks. On one hand, cell biologists have used fluorescence microscopy to visualize the dynamics of specific proteins, providing crucial insights into their localization and function. On the other hand, biophysicists have employed techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical tweezers to probe the mechanical properties of cells and reconstituted cytoskeletal networks. Seminal work on reconstituted actin networks, for example, has revealed how cross-linker density and filament length control the viscoelastic properties of the material, establishing the cytoskeleton as a prime example of soft condensed matter. Similarly, theoretical frameworks such as active gel theory have provided powerful phenomenological models that capture the behavior of the cytoskeleton as a fluid-like material driven by internal stresses generated by motor proteins. However, a significant gap persists between our understanding of individual components and the integrated, emergent mechanics of the cell. Models are often parameterized using data from simplified in vitro systems, which lack the molecular crowding, spatial confinement, and compositional complexity of the native cellular environment. While techniques like super-resolution microscopy have improved our view of the cytoskeleton, they often lack the 3D isotropic resolution and molecular identification needed to map the complete network architecture. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a transformative technology, providing nanometer-resolution 3D snapshots of the cytoskeleton within vitrified, near-native state cells. These tomograms contain a wealth of architectural information—filament lengths, orientations, branching angles, and cross-linker distributions—that has been largely untapped due to the immense challenge of manual segmentation and analysis. The recent explosion of publicly available data presents an unprecedented opportunity to bridge this gap. Large-scale repositories like the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR), the Image Data Resource (IDR), and the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database now house a critical mass of ultrastructural, dynamic, and compositional data from a wide range of cell types and conditions. This project is timely because recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning-based image segmentation, provide the necessary tools to automate the extraction of quantitative architectural information from cryo-ET data at scale. By synthesizing these disparate data modalities—ultrastructure, composition, dynamics, and mechanics—we can construct a new generation of data-driven, multi-scale models. Such a framework is essential for addressing fundamental questions in mechanobiology and disease. For instance, in cancer, altered cell mechanics are a hallmark of metastasis, but the underlying changes in cytoskeletal architecture and composition are poorly understood. Similarly, many congenital myopathies and cardiomyopathies are caused by mutations in cytoskeletal proteins, but how these molecular defects propagate to cause tissue-level mechanical failure remains unclear. This proposal outlines a collaborative, transdisciplinary effort to build a predictive framework of the cell as a living material, directly linking molecular-level details to emergent cellular function and dysfunction.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is guided by the overarching question: How do the specific 3D architecture, molecular composition, and dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton collectively determine the emergent mechanical properties of the cell? To deconstruct this complex problem, we have formulated four specific, interconnected research questions (RQs) and their corresponding testable hypotheses (H). \n\nRQ1: What are the fundamental quantitative principles governing the 3D architecture of distinct cytoskeletal assemblies (e.g., lamellipodial actin networks, stress fibers, cortical actin) in their native cellular context? \nH1: We hypothesize that different functional assemblies of the cytoskeleton are characterized by unique and quantifiable architectural signatures. Specifically, we predict that lamellipodial networks will exhibit a high density of short, branched filaments with a narrow orientation distribution, consistent with dendritic nucleation, whereas stress fibers will be defined by long, aligned filaments with a high density of bundling cross-linkers. We further hypothesize that these architectural parameters are not random but follow specific statistical distributions (e.g., exponential length distributions) that reflect the underlying polymerization and severing dynamics. This hypothesis will be tested by applying our AI-powered segmentation pipeline to public cryo-ET tomograms of various cell types and subcellular regions, extracting a multi-dimensional vector of architectural features (filament density, length distribution, orientation tensor, cross-link density, mesh size) for each region. \n\nRQ2: How does the local proteomic composition of the cytoskeleton correlate with, and potentially determine, its local 3D architecture? \nH2: We hypothesize that a direct, predictive relationship exists between the relative abundance of key cytoskeleton-associated proteins and the observed network architecture. For example, we predict that the local ratio of Arp2/3 complex to formins, inferred from whole-cell proteomics data, will strongly correlate with the degree of filament branching versus alignment observed in cryo-ET. Similarly, the ratio of bundling proteins (e.g., fascin, alpha-actinin) to cross-linking proteins (e.g., filamin) will correlate with the prevalence of filament bundles versus isotropic networks. We will test this by integrating quantitative proteomics data (from PRIDE) with our architectural measurements from cryo-ET for matched cell types. We will build a statistical correlation model to identify key protein determinants of specific architectural motifs. \n\nRQ3: Can a multi-scale computational model, parameterized directly with integrated architectural and proteomic data, accurately predict the emergent, cell-scale mechanical properties measured experimentally? \nH3: We hypothesize that an agent-based model (ABM) of the cytoskeleton, whose parameters (e.g., filament lengths, cross-linker densities, motor protein concentrations) are directly sampled from the distributions derived from cryo-ET and proteomics data, will quantitatively reproduce the bulk mechanical responses (e.g., Young's modulus, viscoelastic loss and storage moduli) of cells as measured by AFM. We predict that our data-driven model will outperform models parameterized with generic or in vitro-derived values. Validation will be achieved by simulating AFM indentation on our virtual cytoskeletons and comparing the resulting force-displacement curves with publicly available experimental data for the same cell types. The model's success will be quantified by the root-mean-square error between simulated and experimental results. \n\nRQ4: How do disease-associated perturbations in cytoskeletal proteins alter network architecture and, consequently, the emergent cellular mechanics? \nH4: We hypothesize that our validated framework can predict the mechanical consequences of molecular perturbations. Specifically, we predict that simulating a cancer-associated upregulation of the severing protein cofilin (by decreasing the average filament length in the ABM's parameter set) will result in a significant decrease in predicted cell stiffness, consistent with the known phenotype of increased deformability in metastatic cells. Conversely, simulating a mutation that impairs the function of a cross-linking protein implicated in muscular dystrophy will lead to a predicted decrease in the network's ability to bear sustained loads. These predictions will be tested against public AFM datasets from cell lines expressing these specific mutations, providing a powerful validation of our model's predictive capability. \n\nExpected Deliverables: The primary deliverables will be: (1) A comprehensive, integrated database linking quantitative cytoskeletal architectures with proteomic profiles and mechanical properties for multiple cell types. (2) A suite of open-source, AI-driven software tools for segmenting and analyzing cytoskeletal networks in cryo-ET data. (3) A validated, multi-scale, and open-source computational model of the cytoskeleton that serves as a community resource. (4) A set of predictive 'phase diagrams' that map molecular composition and architecture to emergent mechanical phenotypes.",

This data will not be used for initial parameterization but will be crucial for validating the dynamic aspects of our models in Phase 3 (e.g., turnover rates, filament growth speeds).\n*   **Data Harmonization:** A critical task will be to develop a unified metadata schema to link these disparate datasets. We will create a relational database that maps datasets by cell line, genotype, and experimental conditions, enabling robust cross-modal analysis.\n*   **AI-Powered Segmentation and Analysis:** This is the core innovation of Phase 1. We will develop a deep learning pipeline for automated segmentation of cytoskeletal elements from cryo-ET volumes. We will employ a 3D U-Net architecture, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) adept at biomedical image segmentation. The model will be trained on a 'ground truth' dataset of ~5-10 tomograms manually segmented by our cryo-ET expert. The trained model will then be applied to the full dataset to segment filaments (actin, microtubules), cross-links, and other structures. From these segmented volumes, a custom Python-based analysis toolkit will extract a rich set of quantitative architectural parameters: filament length and tortuosity distributions, orientation tensors, branching densities and angles, cross-linker/bundler densities, and network mesh size distributions.\n\n**Phase 2: Multi-Scale Computational Modeling (Months 12-27)**\nUsing the quantitative data from Phase 1, we will develop a hierarchical modeling framework.\n*   **Agent-Based Model (ABM):** At the microscale, we will use the open-source platform CytoSim to build a detailed ABM. Individual filaments will be modeled as semi-flexible polymers. Cross-linkers and motors will be modeled as two-headed spring-like elements with stochastic binding/unbinding kinetics. Crucially, instead of using generic parameters, the model will be instantiated by directly sampling from the statistical distributions of architectural parameters extracted in Phase 1. For example, the initial filament lengths in the simulation will be drawn from the experimentally measured length distribution. The concentrations of different agents (e.g., fascin vs. filamin) will be set by the relative abundances measured in the proteomics data.\n*   **Continuum Mechanics Model:** To bridge to the cellular scale, we will develop a coarse-grained continuum model based on active gel theory. This model describes the cytoskeleton as a viscoelastic material with internal stresses. The key innovation is that the phenomenological parameters of this continuum model (e.g., elastic modulus, viscosity, active stress coefficient) will not be arbitrarily fitted. Instead, they will be systematically derived by performing numerical homogenization on large-scale simulations of the ABM. This creates a direct, mechanistic link between the microscale architecture and the macroscale material properties.\n\n**Phase 3: Model Validation, Prediction, and Dissemination (Months 24-36)**\n*   **Validation:** The framework's predictive power will be rigorously tested. We will simulate AFM indentation in both the ABM and continuum models. The resulting force-indentation curves and calculated Young's moduli will be compared directly against the experimental AFM data curated in Phase 1. We will also validate dynamic aspects by simulating processes like fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and comparing the recovery timescales to experimental data from the IDR.\n*   **Predictive Simulations:** Once validated, the model will be used to test hypotheses about disease states (as outlined in RQ4). We will systematically alter specific model parameters to mimic known mutations (e.g., change cross-linker binding affinity, alter motor protein velocity) and predict the resulting changes in network architecture and bulk mechanics.\n*   **Timeline and Milestones:**\n    *   M6: Curation and harmonization of initial 20 datasets across four modalities.\n    *   M12: Version 1.0 of the AI segmentation pipeline released on GitHub.\n    *   M18: Complete architectural parameter database for three cell types.\n    *   M24: First validated ABM for a single cell type, linking architecture to mechanics.\n    *   M30: Continuum model parameterized and validated; predictive simulations of disease mutations initiated.\n    *   M36: Final integrated database, all models, and analysis tools publicly released with comprehensive documentation and tutorials.",

This 'virtual cytoskeleton' will allow researchers to perform in silico experiments that are difficult or impossible to conduct in living cells, such as systematically titrating the concentration of a specific protein or altering its biophysical properties to observe the impact on cell stiffness or force generation.\n4.  **Fundamental Insights into Cytoskeletal Design Principles:** By analyzing the relationships between composition, architecture, and mechanics across different cell types and functional assemblies, our project will uncover fundamental 'design principles' of the cytoskeleton. We expect to reveal how cells robustly tune their mechanical properties by modulating specific architectural features, providing deep insights into the evolution and function of this essential cellular system.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Biomedical Relevance:** The framework will have direct implications for understanding human disease.

This commitment ensures our outputs are a lasting community resource that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).\n*   **Dissemination and Community Engagement:** We will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, presentations at international conferences (e.g., ASCB, Biophysical Society), and a dedicated project website with tutorials and documentation. We will organize workshops at conferences to train researchers in the use of our tools, ensuring broad adoption and maximizing the project's impact.\n\n**Long-Term Vision:** This project will establish a durable, collaborative network and a foundational framework that is extensible. In the future, this 'living material' model can be expanded to incorporate other cellular components, such as the cell membrane and nucleus, and other physical phenomena, like mechanochemical signaling. It will serve as a cornerstone for a future 'whole-cell' mechanical model, transforming our ability to understand and engineer cellular behavior.",

        "background_and_significance": "The community of microorganisms residing in the human gut, collectively known as the microbiome, functions as a complex, adaptive ecosystem that is integral to host physiology. This intricate relationship is not merely commensal; it is a deeply symbiotic partnership where host health emerges from a dynamic interplay of microbial community structure, metabolic function, and host response. The primary language of this host-microbe dialogue is chemical. Microbes produce a vast and diverse arsenal of small molecules—from simple short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) to complex polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides—that directly interact with host cells, shaping mucosal immunity, metabolic regulation, and even neurobehavioral development. Landmark studies have identified key examples of this chemical communication. For instance, the SCFA butyrate, produced by Firmicutes bacteria, serves as a primary energy source for colonocytes and acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, epigenetically regulating host gene expression to promote anti-inflammatory responses and fortify the gut barrier. Similarly, secondary bile acids, produced through multi-step microbial transformations, act as signaling molecules for nuclear receptors like FXR, influencing lipid metabolism and innate immunity. Despite these foundational discoveries, our understanding of this chemical lexicon remains rudimentary. The known microbial metabolites represent a tiny fraction of the chemical space within the gut. Untargeted metabolomics studies consistently reveal thousands of molecular features in fecal and intestinal samples, the vast majority of which are of unknown structure and origin—the 'dark matter' of the gut metabolome. Concurrently, advances in genomics have unveiled the immense biosynthetic potential encoded within microbial genomes. Computational tools like antiSMASH can predict tens of thousands of unique biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from public metagenomic data, each potentially producing a novel bioactive molecule. This creates two major knowledge gaps that impede progress in the field. The first is the 'gene-to-metabolite' gap: we cannot systematically link the predicted BGCs to the molecules they produce in the complex in vivo environment. The second is the 'metabolite-to-function' gap: for the thousands of unknown molecules we can detect, we lack any knowledge of their biological effects on the host. Current research efforts typically focus on one aspect of this triad—microbial composition, metabolomic profiles, or host gene expression—in isolation. While multi-omics studies are becoming more common, they often rely on simple correlation analyses between a few data types and are limited to the scale of a single lab or cohort. A systematic, integrative approach to connect all three layers—microbial genetic potential, the resulting chemical environment, and the host's cellular response—has not been undertaken at a community-wide scale. This project is both important and timely because we are at a unique inflection point. The exponential growth of publicly available data in repositories like NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the MetaboLights database, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has created an unprecedented, yet underutilized, resource. Simultaneously, advances in machine learning, network theory, and computational chemistry provide the necessary tools to synthesize these disparate datasets. By framing host physiology as an emergent property of the microbiome's collective chemical output, we can move beyond descriptive cataloging of microbes. This research will establish a new paradigm for understanding host-microbe symbiosis, treating it as a complex system where community-level microbial genetics gives rise to a chemical milieu that orchestrates host cellular behavior. Decoding this lexicon is critical for translating microbiome science into predictable, mechanism-based therapeutics for a wide range of human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune disorders.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is organized around three central aims, each designed to bridge a critical gap in our understanding of host-microbe chemical communication. By systematically integrating public multi-omics data, we will construct a comprehensive atlas that maps the flow of information from microbial genes to microbial chemicals to host cellular responses, thereby elucidating the emergent properties of this complex system.\n\n**Aim 1: To construct a probabilistic linkage map between microbial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and observed gut metabolites.**\nThis aim addresses the fundamental 'gene-to-metabolite' gap. While we can predict the biosynthetic potential of the microbiome, we lack a systematic method to identify the actual molecular products in vivo.\n*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can we statistically associate the presence and abundance patterns of specific BGCs across thousands of public metagenomes with the presence and abundance of specific metabolite features in corresponding public metabolomes?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** The co-occurrence patterns of a BGC and its true metabolic product across diverse human cohorts will exhibit a significantly stronger statistical dependency than random BGC-metabolite pairs. We hypothesize that a multi-modal machine learning framework, integrating correlation metrics, mutual information, and probabilistic graphical models, can identify these true pairings with a quantifiable confidence score.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will test this hypothesis by first applying our pipeline to a 'gold standard' set of known BGC-metabolite pairs (e.g., those for butyrate synthesis, secondary bile acid conversion, salinomycin). Our model must recover these known links with high probability. For novel predictions, we will perform in silico validation by comparing the predicted elemental formula from the BGC's biosynthetic pathway with the formula derived from high-resolution mass spectrometry data of the linked metabolite. The expected outcome is a comprehensive, weighted BGC-Metabolite map, representing the first large-scale dictionary linking microbial genetic potential to chemical output.\n\n**Aim 2: To identify host cellular pathways that are significantly modulated by specific microbe-derived metabolites.**\nThis aim tackles the 'metabolite-to-function' gap by connecting the chemical environment of the gut to the host's physiological response at the molecular level.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** Which host gene expression signatures in intestinal epithelial cells and gut-resident immune cells consistently co-vary with the abundance of specific microbial metabolites across diverse health and disease states (e.g., IBD vs. healthy, CRC vs. healthy)?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** Specific microbial metabolites, or structurally related families of metabolites, will be significantly and reproducibly correlated with the coordinated up- or down-regulation of distinct host biological pathways. For example, we predict that a class of unidentified polyketides will correlate with the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, while certain bacterially-modified lipids will correlate with inflammasome activation signatures in host immune cells.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will leverage public datasets from gnotobiotic mouse experiments, where the host is colonized with defined microbial communities, as a validation cohort. In these controlled systems, the links between specific microbes, their metabolites, and host response are less confounded. We will test if the metabolite-pathway associations discovered in human data can predict host gene expression changes in these gnotobiotic models. Furthermore, we will cross-reference our findings with pharmacological databases (e.g., STITCH, DrugBank) to see if our predicted bioactive metabolites are structurally similar to known drugs that target the implicated host pathways.\n\n**Aim 3: To build and query an integrated 'Microbe-Metabolite-Host Gene' atlas to model emergent host phenotypes.**\nThis aim synthesizes the findings from Aims 1 and 2 into a unified, multi-layered network model to understand the system-level properties of host-microbe communication.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can a multi-scale network model, representing the flow of information from microbial community genetics to the chemical environment and ultimately to the host's transcriptional state, reveal principles of emergent host-microbe homeostasis and dysbiosis?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** The topology of the integrated network will reveal 'keystone' metabolites and 'communication hubs'—molecules that are central to mediating the microbiome's influence on the host. We hypothesize that the state of this integrated network, captured using graph-based machine learning features, will be more predictive of host phenotype (e.g., IBD diagnosis or treatment response) than any single data modality alone.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** The predictive power of our integrated atlas will be rigorously tested on held-out datasets not used in model construction. We will build machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Graph Convolutional Networks) to predict disease status using features derived from: (1) metagenomics only, (2) metabolomics only, (3) host transcriptomics only, and (4) our integrated network. Our hypothesis will be supported if the integrated model demonstrates significantly superior performance (e.g., higher AUROC and AUPRC). The primary deliverable will be the 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas,' an open-access, interactive web portal for the scientific community to explore these multi-omic relationships.",
        "methods_and_approach": "**Data Acquisition, Curation, and Harmonization**\nThis project exclusively utilizes publicly available data. Our first task is to build a comprehensive, curated, and harmonized data repository. \n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically query major public repositories including NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and MG-RAST for metagenomic data; MetaboLights, GNPS, and Metabolomics Workbench for untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data; and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for host transcriptomic data (RNA-seq). We will prioritize studies with multiple data types from the same subjects, such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database.\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:** We will select datasets based on rigorous criteria: (1) availability of raw data (e.g., FASTQ, mzML); (2) sufficient sequencing depth or instrument resolution; (3) comprehensive and standardized metadata (e.g., diagnosis, sample type, age, sex); (4) studies focusing on human gut samples or relevant gnotobiotic mouse models. We anticipate aggregating over 10,000 metagenomes, 5,000 metabolomes, and 5,000 transcriptomes.\n*   **Standardized Re-processing:** To mitigate batch effects and ensure comparability, all raw data will be re-processed through standardized, containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipelines. Metagenomic reads will be quality-controlled with FastQC/Trimmomatic and assembled with MEGAHIT. Metabolomic data will be processed using a uniform MZmine 2 workflow for feature detection and alignment. RNA-seq data will be processed via a STAR/RSEM pipeline for alignment and quantification.\n\n**Aim 1: BGC-Metabolite Linkage Pipeline**\n1.  **BGC Prediction and Grouping:** Assembled metagenomic contigs will be analyzed with antiSMASH (v6.0) to identify BGCs. The predicted BGCs will then be grouped into Gene Cluster Families (GCFs) using BiG-SCAPE, which compares BGCs based on domain architecture and sequence similarity. This reduces the complexity from millions of individual BGCs to tens of thousands of GCFs. The output will be a sample-by-GCF abundance matrix.\n2.  **Metabolite Feature Networking:** Processed metabolomic features will be organized using molecular networking on the GNPS platform. This method groups ions with similar fragmentation spectra (MS/MS), which often correspond to structurally related molecules. This creates a sample-by-metabolite feature/family abundance matrix.\n3.  **Probabilistic Association:** We will employ a multi-pronged statistical approach to link the GCF and metabolite matrices. We will first use Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) to identify latent variables that explain the maximum shared variance between the two datasets. In parallel, we will use tools like MIMOSA2, which models the conditional probability of a metabolic pathway's (or GCF's) activity given the community composition. Finally, we will construct a probabilistic graphical model to infer direct dependencies. The consensus from these methods will generate a high-confidence list of BGC-metabolite links, each with a quantitative confidence score.\n\n**Aim 2: Metabolite-Host Pathway Correlation Pipeline**\n1.  **Host Transcriptome Analysis:** For samples with paired metabolomics and host transcriptomics, we will perform differential expression analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify host pathways that are active in specific conditions. \n2.  **Multi-Omic Correlation:** We will use the WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) R package to identify modules of highly co-expressed host genes. The eigengene (first principal component) of each module, which represents the module's overall expression pattern, will then be correlated with the abundance of every microbial metabolite feature. This powerful approach reduces multiple testing burdens and identifies metabolites associated with entire biological processes rather than single genes. We will use linear mixed-effects models to account for covariates and repeated measures where applicable.\n\n**Aim 3: Atlas Construction and Predictive Modeling**\n1.  **Network Integration:** The results from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated into a multi-partite graph using network analysis libraries (e.g., NetworkX in Python). The graph will contain three types of nodes (GCFs, Metabolites, Host Genes/Pathways). Edges will connect nodes based on the analyses above, weighted by the statistical significance (e.g., correlation coefficient, probability score) of the association.\n2.  **Topological Analysis and Hypothesis Generation:** We will analyze the network's structure to identify key features. Centrality algorithms (e.g., betweenness, degree) will pinpoint 'keystone' metabolites that bridge many microbes to many host functions. Community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain modularity) will reveal functional modules, such as a group of microbes producing a class of metabolites that collectively modulate a specific immune pathway.\n3.  **Graph-Based Machine Learning:** To test the predictive power of the atlas, we will use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). A GCN is a type of neural network that operates directly on graphs, learning to classify nodes or entire graphs. We will train a GCN to classify samples as 'healthy' or 'diseased' (e.g., IBD) using the integrated network structure and node abundances as input. The model's performance will be evaluated on a held-out test set and compared against baseline models using single data types.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones**\n*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition, curation, and establishment of standardized processing pipelines. Development and benchmarking of the BGC-Metabolite linkage pipeline. Milestone: A fully operational, containerized workflow for processing all three data types; processing of 50% of target datasets.\n*   **Year 2:** Full-scale execution of Aim 1 and Aim 2 analyses. Milestone: Generation of the first draft of the BGC-Metabolite map and a prioritized list of metabolite-host pathway associations. First manuscript in preparation.\n*   **Year 3:** Integration of results into the network atlas (Aim 3). Development of the predictive GCN model. Design and implementation of the public-facing interactive web portal. Milestone: A functional beta version of the 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas' web portal.\n*   **Year 4:** Model refinement, validation on independent cohorts, and finalization of the Atlas. Dissemination activities, including manuscript submissions, conference presentations, and community training workshops. Milestone: Public release of the Atlas and all associated code; submission of two major manuscripts.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "**Intellectual Merit and Contribution to the Field**\nThis project is poised to make transformative contributions to molecular and cellular biosciences by fundamentally shifting how we study host-microbiome interactions. \n1.  **A New Paradigm for Microbiome Research:** Our primary outcome will be a paradigm shift from descriptive, census-based studies ('who is there?') to a mechanistic, function-centric understanding ('what are they doing and how does it matter?'). By decoding the chemical language of the microbiome, we will provide a framework for understanding how emergent host phenotypes, such as immune homeostasis or disease susceptibility, arise from the collective metabolic output of a complex microbial community. This directly addresses the research call's focus on emergence phenomena.\n2.  **A Foundational, Community-Wide Resource:** The principal deliverable, the 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas,' will be a first-of-its-kind, publicly accessible resource. Analogous to foundational databases like KEGG for metabolic pathways or the Gene Ontology for gene function, our Atlas will provide a comprehensive, queryable map of microbe-metabolite-host interactions. This will empower researchers, even those without deep computational expertise, to generate novel, data-driven hypotheses. For example, an immunologist studying a specific cytokine could query the Atlas to identify candidate microbial metabolites that regulate its expression, along with the microbes and genes responsible for their production.\n3.  **Methodological Innovation in Multi-omics Integration:** The computational pipeline we develop will be a significant methodological advancement. Integrating three distinct and high-dimensional data types (genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics) poses immense statistical and computational challenges. Our novel framework, combining network science, probabilistic modeling, and graph-based machine learning, will provide a robust and adaptable blueprint for data synthesis that can be applied to other complex biological systems beyond the gut microbiome.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications**\nBeyond its fundamental scientific contributions, this project will have far-reaching impacts on therapeutic development, workforce training, and the practice of open science.\n1.  **Accelerating Therapeutic and Diagnostic Development:** The Atlas will serve as a powerful engine for hypothesis generation, directly informing the development of next-generation microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. Identifying specific anti-inflammatory metabolites could lead to the development of 'postbiotic' drugs for IBD. Conversely, discovering microbial metabolites that promote cell proliferation could yield new non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer. Our work will provide a mechanistic rationale for the targeted manipulation of the microbiome, moving beyond the trial-and-error approach of fecal microbiota transplantation.\n2.  **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment for the 'future data-savvy workforce' envisioned by the research call. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work in a deeply collaborative, transdisciplinary team, gaining hands-on expertise at the cutting edge of computational biology, bioinformatics, microbiology, and immunology. We will host an annual open-to-the-public workshop to disseminate our methods and train the broader community, thereby amplifying our educational impact.\n3.  **Championing Open and Reproducible Science:** Our commitment to open science is unwavering.

        "background_and_significance": "Aging is a complex, multifactorial process and the primary risk factor for most chronic human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. For decades, research has focused on cell-intrinsic mechanisms, elegantly summarized in the 'Hallmarks of Aging' framework (López-Otín et al., 2013, 2023). These hallmarks, such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, and epigenetic alterations, describe molecular damage accumulating within individual cells. While this paradigm has been incredibly fruitful, it provides an incomplete picture. It largely overlooks the fact that tissues are not mere collections of independent cells, but complex, dynamic ecosystems. Organismal aging, we posit, is an emergent property arising from the progressive deterioration of these ecosystems, driven by altered cellular composition and a systemic breakdown in intercellular communication. This project reframes aging from a cell-centric problem to a systems-level challenge in cellular ecology. Evidence for this ecological view is mounting. The concept of 'inflammaging' describes a chronic, low-grade, sterile inflammation that characterizes aged tissues, driven by dysfunctional communication between immune cells and stromal cells (Franceschi et al., 2018). Similarly, the accumulation of senescent cells, which secrete a potent mix of inflammatory factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), profoundly remodels the local tissue microenvironment, disrupting homeostasis and promoting age-related pathologies (Coppé et al., 2010). These phenomena highlight that the context and communication between cells are as critical as their individual internal states. The recent explosion in single-cell genomics, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), provides an unprecedented opportunity to deconstruct these complex tissue ecosystems at high resolution. Large-scale public consortia like the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, and Tabula Muris Senis have generated vast repositories of single-cell data from diverse tissues across the lifespan of multiple organisms. These datasets represent a monumental, yet largely untapped, resource for understanding aging as a systemic process. The primary bottleneck preventing a holistic synthesis is a formidable computational and logistical challenge. These datasets were generated by hundreds of different laboratories using varied protocols, platforms, and processing pipelines. This heterogeneity introduces profound technical batch effects that can easily mask the subtle biological signals of aging. While numerous computational methods for data integration exist (e.g., Seurat v4, Harmony, Scanpy), they were primarily designed for smaller-scale projects and often struggle to harmonize data across different technologies, species, and tissues without erasing crucial biological variance. A community-scale effort, uniting experts in gerontology, computational biology, and systems biology, is required to overcome this barrier. This research is therefore critically important and timely. The data exists, but the collaborative framework and advanced analytical strategies to synthesize it into a coherent whole are missing. By creating a unified, pan-tissue 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' this project will address a fundamental gap in our knowledge: how do cell-intrinsic changes translate into the emergent, system-wide functional decline of an organism? Answering this question will not only provide a new conceptual framework for aging research but also reveal novel, high-priority targets for interventions aimed at extending human healthspan.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is organized around three central aims, each designed to address fundamental questions about the emergent nature of aging. Our overarching goal is to move beyond tissue-specific descriptions to uncover universal principles of aging at the level of cellular ecosystems. \n\n**Aim 1: Develop a robust, scalable computational framework for the pan-tissue, cross-species integration of public single-cell aging data.** This aim addresses the primary technical barrier to a systems-level understanding of aging.\n*   **Research Question 1.1:** How can we effectively disentangle true biological aging signals from confounding technical variables (e.g., study-specific batch effects, dissociation protocols, sequencing platforms) across hundreds of heterogeneous single-cell datasets?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a hierarchical, deep learning-based integration strategy will significantly outperform current linear or shallow non-linear methods. By first correcting batch effects within tissues and then using a transfer learning approach to project all data into a shared latent space, our framework will maximally preserve cell-type identity and subtle age-related state transitions while minimizing technical artifacts. We will validate this by demonstrating superior performance on established integration metrics (e.g., Local Inverse Simpson's Index for batch mixing, Adjusted Rand Index for label conservation) compared to standard pipelines.\n\n**Aim 2: Define and validate consensus, cross-tissue molecular signatures of aging for major cell types.** This aim seeks to identify the fundamental, conserved changes that occur in specific cell types, regardless of their tissue environment.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** Do universal aging programs exist within conserved cell lineages (e.g., fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, macrophages) that are independent of their tissue of residence?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that beyond tissue-specific adaptations, common cell types will exhibit a core set of age-associated changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility related to fundamental cellular processes like metabolic stress, proteostasis failure, and inflammatory response. We predict that our integrated atlas will reveal a 'pan-fibroblast' aging signature, for example, that is conserved across skin, lung, and heart, providing a more fundamental definition of cellular aging.\n*   **Research Question 2.2:** How does cellular heterogeneity and plasticity change with age within a given cell type?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.2:** We hypothesize that aging leads to a loss of cellular identity and an increase in transcriptional noise, resulting in the emergence of aberrant, dysfunctional cell sub-states. We predict that trajectory inference and heterogeneity analyses will reveal a 'blurring' of distinct functional cell states in aged tissues and the appearance of novel senescent-like or pro-fibrotic subpopulations that contribute to tissue decline. \n\n**Aim 3: Map the systemic rewiring of intercellular communication networks as an emergent driver of organismal aging.** This aim directly investigates aging as a property of the cellular ecosystem.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** Which specific signaling pathways and ligand-receptor interactions are consistently gained, lost, or altered across disparate aging tissues, and which cell types are the primary drivers of these changes?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that a key emergent property of aging is a systemic shift from tissue-specific, homeostatic signaling to a convergent, chronic pro-inflammatory communication network (inflammaging). We predict that computational inference of cell-cell communication will reveal a conserved gain of signaling mediated by TNF, IL-1, and IL-6, and a concomitant loss of regenerative signaling (e.g., Wnt, FGF), primarily driven by activated immune and stromal cell populations across multiple tissues.\n*   **Research Question 3.2:** Can we identify 'keystone' cell types or communication hubs whose dysregulation has a disproportionately large impact on the entire tissue ecosystem?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.2:** We hypothesize that specific cell populations, such as senescent fibroblasts or a subset of tissue-resident macrophages, act as central, pathological signaling hubs in aged tissues. We predict that network analysis of the inferred communication graphs will identify these cell types as having the highest centrality scores in aged tissues, and that their specific ligand emissions are the primary drivers of age-related transcriptional changes in neighboring epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will exclusively synthesize publicly available data, requiring a transdisciplinary team and a robust computational infrastructure that necessitates NCEMS support. Our approach is structured around our three research aims and a detailed project timeline.\n\n**Data Acquisition, Curation, and Standardization**\nOur working group will systematically query major public repositories, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, the Single Cell Portal, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Data Coordination Platform, and the GTEx Portal. We will focus on scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets from human and mouse tissues with clearly annotated chronological age information (e.g., 'young' vs. 'old' cohorts). A critical first step, requiring a collaborative effort, will be the development of a unified metadata schema. We will manually curate and standardize all available sample- and cell-level information, including species, tissue, age, sex, experimental protocol, and original author-provided cell annotations. This standardized metadata is essential for downstream modeling and interpretation and represents a significant contribution in itself.\n\n**Aim 1: Computational Integration Framework**\nOur analytical pipeline will begin with a standardized pre-processing workflow for each dataset, including quality control, normalization (e.g., SCTransform for RNA, TF-IDF for ATAC), and feature selection. For integration, we will develop a novel, three-stage hierarchical approach:\n1.  **Intra-Tissue Integration:** For each tissue with multiple available datasets (e.g., mouse lung), we will first use an established method like Harmony to correct for study-specific batch effects, creating a harmonized representation for that single tissue.\n2.  **Cross-Tissue, Single-Cell-Type Integration:** We will then develop a more powerful, non-linear integration model based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). For each major cell type (e.g., fibroblasts), we will train a CVAE to learn a latent space that is conditioned on tissue identity but is invariant to technical batch effects. This allows us to directly compare, for example, a lung fibroblast to a skin fibroblast.\n3.  **Pan-Atlas Assembly:** Finally, we will use a transfer learning approach to project all cell-type-specific latent spaces into a global, shared embedding. This final atlas will allow for comparisons across both cell types and tissues.\nWe will rigorously benchmark this framework against state-of-the-art methods using quantitative metrics for batch correction (kBET, LISI) and biological conservation (cell type ARI, silhouette width). This methodological development is a core component of the project.\n\n**Aim 2: Defining Consensus Aging Signatures**\nWith the integrated atlas, we will first establish a consistent, cross-dataset cell type ontology. This will involve a combination of automated annotation tools (e.g., Azimuth, SingleR) followed by manual review and refinement by the domain experts within our working group. To identify aging signatures, we will employ pseudo-bulk differential expression (DE) and differential accessibility (DA) analyses, aggregating counts for each cell type within each biological sample. This approach allows the use of robust statistical models like DESeq2 and limma that properly account for inter-individual variability. A 'core' aging signature for a cell type will be defined as genes or chromatin regions that are significantly altered with age in the same direction across at least three distinct tissues. We will use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and other pathway tools to determine the biological functions of these core signatures. To analyze changes in heterogeneity, we will quantify transcriptional variance and use trajectory inference tools (e.g., scVelo, Palantir) to map age-associated shifts in cell state landscapes.\n\n**Aim 3: Mapping Intercellular Communication Networks**\nWe will leverage the harmonized gene expression data to infer intercellular signaling. We will apply a suite of algorithms, including CellChat, NicheNet, and scConnect, which use ligand-receptor expression databases to predict the strength and targets of communication pathways between all cell types. By comparing the inferred networks between young and old atlas subsets, we will perform differential network analysis to identify signaling pathways that are consistently gained or lost with age across tissues. We will then use graph theory metrics (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality) to identify 'keystone' cell types that act as major signaling hubs in the aged communication network. The predictions from this analysis will generate specific, testable hypotheses about the drivers of tissue-level decline.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones**\n*   **Year 1:** Data acquisition and metadata standardization completed. Development and benchmarking of the integration framework (Aim 1). Release of a pilot atlas integrating 3-4 key tissues. Publication on the integration methodology.\n*   **Year 2:** Completion of the full pan-tissue, cross-species atlas. Consensus cell type annotation finalized. Identification and initial characterization of core aging signatures for major cell types (Aim 2). Development of the public web portal begins.\n*   **Year 3:** Comprehensive cell-cell communication network analysis (Aim 3). Final synthesis of all findings. Launch of the interactive 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging' web portal. Submission of the main atlas manuscript to a high-impact journal. Host a community-wide training workshop.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to be transformative, producing novel biological insights, powerful new methodologies, and a foundational resource for the scientific community, directly aligning with the NCEMS mission to catalyze multidisciplinary synthesis research.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field**\n1.  **A Foundational Public Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' an open-access, interactive web portal. This resource will allow any researcher, regardless of computational expertise, to explore the effects of aging on any major cell type across a wide range of tissues and species. It will serve as a central hypothesis-generation engine for the entire aging research community, analogous to the impact of resources like the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or the Human Cell Atlas (HCA).\n2.  **A Paradigm Shift in Aging Biology:** Our work will provide the first comprehensive, systems-level view of aging as an emergent property of deteriorating cellular ecosystems. By identifying consensus, pan-tissue aging signatures and mapping the systemic rewiring of cell-cell communication, we will move the field beyond a cell-intrinsic focus. This will establish a new conceptual framework for understanding how molecular damage translates into organismal decline, revealing the ecological principles that govern tissue homeostasis and its failure with age.\n3.  **Methodological Advancement in Computational Biology:** The hierarchical deep learning framework we develop for data integration will represent a significant advance for the analysis of large-scale, heterogeneous single-cell data. This open-source tool will be broadly applicable to other complex biological questions that require the synthesis of disparate public datasets, extending its impact beyond aging research.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications**\n*   **Therapeutic Development:** By identifying the most conserved molecular pathways and central 'keystone' cell types that drive aging across multiple organs, our atlas will pinpoint the highest-priority targets for pro-longevity interventions. Therapeutics targeting a pan-tissue mechanism are more likely to have systemic benefits and improve overall healthspan, rather than targeting a single disease in isolation. For example, identifying a specific signaling pathway from senescent fibroblasts that disrupts endothelial function across all tissues would nominate that pathway as a prime target for novel senotherapeutics.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** The core aging signatures we define for accessible cell types (e.g., immune cells in the blood) can serve as the basis for developing highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of biological age. Such biomarkers are urgently needed to assess the efficacy of anti-aging interventions in clinical trials.\n\n**Dissemination, Open Science, and Sustainability**\nWe are fully committed to open science principles. All analysis code will be version-controlled and publicly available on GitHub. All processed data objects, standardized metadata, and results will be deposited in FAIR-compliant repositories like Zenodo and Figshare. Our findings will be disseminated through high-impact publications (targeting journals like *Cell*, *Nature*, and *Science* for the main atlas and *Nature Methods* for the computational framework), and presentations at international conferences. The long-term sustainability of the web portal will be ensured through its integration with established platforms and by seeking follow-up funding to maintain and expand the atlas as new data becomes available.\n\n**Training and Collaboration**\nThe project structure as an NCEMS Working Group is essential for its success. It brings together a diverse team of gerontologists, computational scientists, and systems biologists, fostering the cross-disciplinary collaboration required to tackle this challenge. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of this effort, receiving unique, hands-on training at the intersection of data science, genomics, and aging biology, thereby cultivating the next generation of data-savvy biomedical researchers as mandated by the research call.",

This team will form the core of the Working Group's analytical effort.\n*   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2):** $280,000. One fellow with expertise in computational biology and machine learning will lead the development of the integration framework. A second fellow with a background in systems biology and gerontology will lead the biological interpretation, pathway analysis, and cell-cell communication modeling.\n*   **Graduate Students (2):** $180,000. Two students will support the massive effort of data acquisition, metadata curation, and execution of specific analytical pipelines, while receiving unparalleled cross-disciplinary training.\n*   **Data Scientist/Software Engineer (0.5 FTE):** $120,000.

Summer salary support for the PIs to provide dedicated oversight and scientific direction.\n\n**Computational Resources ($100,000)**\nThe scale of this project—integrating millions of cells from hundreds of datasets—requires substantial computational power. Training and benchmarking deep learning models is computationally intensive and requires significant GPU resources. While university HPC clusters are available, their queue times and resource limits are not conducive to rapid, iterative model development. We request funds for cloud computing credits (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) to provide on-demand access to GPU nodes for model training and to host the final, publicly accessible web portal. This cost is a primary reason why such a project cannot be undertaken by an individual lab.\n\n**Meetings and Travel ($60,000)**\nTo foster the deep, synergistic collaboration that is the hallmark of an NCEMS Working Group, we will hold twice-yearly, in-person meetings of the entire team. These meetings are essential for data interpretation, strategic planning, and synthesizing diverse perspectives. Funds are also allocated for travel to one major international conference per year for trainees and PIs to present our findings and engage with the broader scientific community.\n\n**Training and Dissemination ($40,000)**\nWe have budgeted funds to host an annual open workshop in Year 3 to train the wider research community on how to use the atlas and our analytical tools. This directly supports the NCEMS goal of training a data-savvy workforce. Funds are also included for open-access publication fees to ensure our results are freely and immediately available to all.\n\n**Total Requested Budget: $850,000**"

        "background_and_significance": "The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information, but it is now clear that this process is profoundly regulated by the physical organization of the genome in three-dimensional space. The packaging of a two-meter long DNA polymer into a nucleus mere microns in diameter is not merely a feat of compaction; it is a dynamic, functional architecture that orchestrates gene expression programs essential for cellular identity and function. The advent of chromosome conformation capture technologies, particularly Hi-C, has revolutionized our understanding of this 3D genome, revealing a hierarchical organization of chromosome territories, A/B compartments corresponding to active and inactive chromatin, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), and specific chromatin loops that connect distal enhancers to their target promoters. Large-scale public consortia, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Program, have generated an unprecedented wealth of data, mapping this 3D architecture alongside 1D epigenomic features—such as histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and protein binding sites—across a vast array of cell types and developmental stages. This data deluge presents a historic opportunity to move beyond descriptive characterizations and address a fundamental, unresolved question: what are the physical principles that govern genome folding? How does the linear sequence of epigenomic marks 'program' the emergent 3D structure? Current theoretical models have provided crucial, yet incomplete, insights. Polymer physics models, such as the Strings and Binders model and the Loop Extrusion model, have successfully explained general features like TAD formation through the action of architectural proteins like CTCF and cohesin. However, these models often rely on a small set of manually-tuned parameters and struggle to capture the cell-type-specific nuances driven by the complex combinatorial code of the epigenome. On the other end of the spectrum, recent machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting Hi-C contact maps from 1D sequence and epigenomic data. Models like Akita and Orca can learn complex patterns but operate largely as 'black boxes,' offering limited mechanistic insight into the underlying physical forces. They predict what the structure looks like, but not why it adopts that conformation. This leaves a critical gap in our knowledge: a unified, predictive, and physically interpretable framework that directly links the 'cause' (the 1D epigenome) to the 'effect' (the 3D structure and its functional consequences). We lack a quantitative 'dictionary' that translates specific combinations of histone modifications and protein binding events into effective physical parameters like local compaction, stiffness, or interaction energies. Bridging this gap is not only a grand challenge in fundamental biology but also holds immense translational potential. Misregulation of the 3D genome is increasingly recognized as a driver of human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Many disease-associated genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in non-coding regions and are thought to function by altering enhancer-promoter loops. Without a predictive model of genome folding, interpreting the functional impact of these variants remains a formidable challenge. This research is therefore exceptionally timely. The availability of massive, harmonized public datasets, coupled with advances in computational power and hybrid AI-physics modeling techniques, creates the perfect conditions for a community-scale synthesis effort. By bringing together a transdisciplinary team of polymer physicists, computer scientists, bioinformaticians, and molecular biologists, this project will tackle this challenge head-on. We aim to build the first generalizable, data-constrained physical model of the genome, transforming our view of chromatin from a static scaffold to a dynamic, programmable matter, and ultimately uncovering the physical basis of gene regulation in health and disease.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is driven by the overarching scientific question: How does the linear, 1D landscape of epigenomic marks and architectural protein binding sites encode the physical rules that govern the emergent, functional 3D folding of the genome? To deconstruct this complex problem, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with a corresponding set of testable hypotheses. Our approach is designed to systematically build a predictive framework, validate its accuracy, and apply it to uncover novel biological insights.\n\n**Research Question 1: Can we derive a generalizable, quantitative mapping between local epigenomic states and the effective physical parameters of a polymer model of chromatin?**\nThis question addresses the core challenge of creating a 'dictionary' that translates biological information into physical properties. We aim to move beyond ad-hoc parameterization and learn these rules directly from data.\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A deep learning model, trained on a diverse compendium of cell types, can learn a robust function that maps a high-dimensional vector of 1D epigenomic features (e.g., levels of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, CTCF binding) to a low-dimensional set of physical parameters (e.g., monomer type, interaction energy, local stiffness) for a coarse-grained polymer simulation.\n*   **Prediction:** We predict this learned mapping will be biologically interpretable. For instance, genomic regions enriched for active marks like H3K4me3 and H3K27ac will be assigned parameters that promote self-association and phase separation, consistent with the formation of active A compartments. Conversely, regions with repressive marks like H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 will be assigned parameters promoting a different type of self-association, forming B compartments. CTCF binding sites will be mapped to parameters that create strong, directional loop anchors.\n*   **Validation:** The generalizability of this mapping will be tested via rigorous cross-validation. The model will be trained on a large subset of cell types (~80%) and its ability to predict the 3D genome architecture of held-out cell types (~20%) from their 1D epigenome alone will be quantified by comparing simulated and experimental Hi-C maps.\n\n**Research Question 2: How accurately can our data-inferred, physics-based model predict de novo changes in 3D genome organization in response to specific molecular perturbations?**\nThis question tests the predictive power and mechanistic validity of our model. A truly robust model should not only recapitulate static structures but also predict how they change when the system is perturbed.\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** Our hybrid AI-physics model will accurately predict the structural consequences of depleting key architectural proteins, such as CTCF or cohesin subunits (e.g., RAD21). \n*   **Prediction:** Simulating CTCF depletion (by removing the specific interaction parameters associated with CTCF sites) will result in a quantifiable loss of TAD insulation and a blurring of domain boundaries in the simulated Hi-C maps. This will manifest as an increase in the insulation score and a decrease in intra-TAD contact frequency, mirroring published experimental results from degron-based studies. The model's predictions will be quantitatively superior to those from models with fixed, non-data-driven parameters.\n*   **Validation:** We will leverage publicly available Hi-C datasets from experiments where specific proteins were acutely depleted. We will compare the difference between our simulated perturbed and unperturbed contact maps with the difference between the experimental perturbed and unperturbed maps.\n\n**Research Question 3: Can the model reveal how epigenomic dysregulation in disease states, such as cancer, leads to pathogenic alterations in 3D genome architecture and gene expression?**\nThis question applies our predictive framework to a critical biomedical problem, aiming to link genotype and epigenotype to phenotype through the lens of 3D genome structure.\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** Our model can predict aberrant enhancer-promoter contacts in cancer cells based on their altered epigenomic landscapes, and these novel contacts will correlate with the misexpression of key oncogenes or tumor suppressors.\n*   **Prediction:** For a cancer cell line with a known amplification of a distal enhancer, our model, when provided with the corresponding epigenomic data (e.g., ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq), will predict the formation of a new, strong chromatin loop connecting this enhancer to an oncogene promoter. This predicted structural change will be associated with a corresponding increase in the oncogene's expression level, as observed in matched RNA-seq data.\n*   **Validation:** We will use matched epigenomic, 3D genomic, and transcriptomic data from cancer cell lines and primary tumors available through consortia like TCGA and CCLE. We will systematically compare our model's predictions of structural rewiring with observed changes in gene expression, identifying statistically significant correlations that point to novel mechanisms of oncogene activation.",
        "methods_and_approach": "Our research plan is structured into three synergistic Aims, designed to systematically collect and harmonize data, develop and train our novel modeling framework, and validate its predictive power. This project exclusively utilizes publicly available data, and its success hinges on the collaborative synthesis of expertise from our multidisciplinary working group.\n\n**Aim 1: Curation, Harmonization, and Integration of a Multi-modal Public Data Compendium.**\nThe foundation of this project is a comprehensive, consistently processed dataset integrating 1D epigenomics, 3D genomics, and transcriptomics. This large-scale data harmonization effort is beyond the scope of a single lab and is a key justification for the working group structure.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically mine major public repositories, including the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Data Portal, the ENCODE Portal, the Cistrome Data Browser, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).\n*   **Data Types and Selection:** We will assemble a diverse collection of datasets from approximately 200 human and mouse cell lines, covering a wide range of developmental stages, tissues, and disease states. This includes:\n    1.  **3D Genomics:** High-resolution in situ Hi-C and Micro-C data to serve as the ground truth for 3D architecture.\n    2.  **1D Epigenomics:** ChIP-seq data for a core set of histone modifications (activating: H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac; repressive: H3K9me3, H3K27me3; elongation: H3K36me3), architectural proteins (CTCF, RAD21, SMC3), and key transcription factors.\n    3.  **Chromatin Accessibility:** ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data.\n    4.  **Transcription:** RNA-seq and/or GRO-seq data to quantify gene expression.\n*   **Processing Pipeline:** To ensure consistency, all raw data will be reprocessed through a unified, containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipeline. Hi-C data will be processed using HiC-Pro and normalized using iterative correction and equilibration (ICE). ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data will be processed using ENCODE standard pipelines. All data will be mapped to the latest reference genome builds (hg38/mm10). The final output will be a multi-modal data tensor where each genomic bin (e.g., 10 kb resolution) is annotated with a feature vector comprising its full epigenomic and transcriptional state.\n\n**Aim 2: Development and Training of a Hybrid AI-Physics Simulation Engine.**\nThis Aim constitutes the core technical innovation of the project, where we will build a new class of predictive model.\n*   **Polymer Physics Framework:** We will implement a coarse-grained bead-spring polymer model using highly efficient simulation engines like OpenMM or LAMMPS, which can leverage GPU acceleration. Each bead will represent a genomic region (e.g., 10 kb), and the model will include potentials for chain connectivity, excluded volume, and specific, non-covalent interactions.\n*   **Machine Learning Architecture:** We will develop a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the mapping from the 1D epigenomic feature vector of a genomic bin to the physical parameters of the corresponding bead in the polymer model. The output of the DNN will define the bead's 'type' or 'color', which in turn dictates its interaction energies with other bead types. This allows for a rich, data-driven parameterization of the physical model. For example, the model can learn that beads with high H3K27ac levels strongly attract each other.\n*   **Differentiable Training Loop:** A key challenge is to train the DNN based on the output of the polymer simulation. We will employ a novel training strategy that makes the entire pipeline differentiable. The polymer simulation will be run for a set number of steps to generate a simulated contact map. A loss function (e.g., stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient) will quantify the difference between the simulated and experimental Hi-C maps. We will use techniques from differentiable physics or reinforcement learning (e.g., policy gradients) to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the DNN's parameters, allowing for end-to-end training via backpropagation. This computationally intensive task requires significant HPC resources and the combined expertise of our physics and computer science team members.\n\n**Aim 3: Model Validation, Perturbation Analysis, and Disease Application.**\nIn this Aim, we will rigorously test our model's predictions and apply it to generate novel biological hypotheses.\n*   **Cross-Cell-Type Validation:** As described in Hypothesis 1.1, we will perform k-fold cross-validation, training the model on a subset of cell types and testing its ability to predict the 3D structure of held-out cell types from their 1D epigenome alone. This will assess the model's generalizability.\n*   **In Silico Perturbation Experiments:** We will use public Hi-C data from experiments involving the acute depletion of proteins like CTCF, WAPL, or cohesin. We will simulate these perturbations by modifying the model's parameters accordingly (e.g., removing CTCF-mediated loop anchor interactions) and compare the predicted changes in contact maps to the experimental data. This provides a stringent test of the model's mechanistic basis.\n*   **Cancer Genome Modeling:** We will apply the fully trained model to cancer cell lines with well-characterized epigenomic alterations (e.g., from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia). We will generate de novo predictions of 3D genome rewiring and correlate these predicted structural changes (e.g., new enhancer-promoter loops) with observed differential gene expression from matched RNA-seq data, thereby generating testable hypotheses about mechanisms of oncogene activation.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and harmonization pipeline (M6). Develop and benchmark the polymer simulation and ML framework (M12). First working group in-person meeting (M3).\n*   **Year 2:** Complete training of the first-generation model on the full dataset (M18). Perform cross-cell-type validation and initial in silico perturbation experiments (M24). Release beta version of the open-source software (M24).\n*   **Year 3:** Conduct comprehensive cancer genome modeling studies (M30). Finalize and publish the simulation engine and the primary scientific findings (M36). Host a community training workshop (M36).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of molecular and cellular biology, genomics, and computational biology. The impact will span from fundamental scientific understanding to potential translational applications, while also building a lasting community resource and training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\nThe primary outcome of this research will be a paradigm shift in how we understand and study genome organization. We will move the field from a descriptive phase, cataloging chromatin structures, to a predictive and mechanistic one.\n1.  **A Unified, Predictive Model of Genome Folding:** We will deliver the first generalizable, physics-based simulation engine that can accurately predict the 3D genome architecture of a mammalian cell solely from its 1D epigenomic profile. This represents a 'holy grail' for the field and will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generating tool for the entire research community.\n2.  **The 'Epigenetic-to-Physical' Rulebook:** Our hybrid AI-physics approach will produce a quantitative mapping—a 'dictionary'—that translates the combinatorial language of histone modifications and protein binding into the physical forces that shape the genome. This will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into how the cell leverages the epigenome to control its physical state and, consequently, its function.\n3.  **Novel Insights into Gene Regulation:** By simulating genome folding in diverse cellular contexts, including development and disease, our model will uncover novel principles of long-range gene regulation. It will allow us to systematically probe how changes in chromatin state lead to the formation or dissolution of enhancer-promoter loops, providing a physical basis for understanding gene expression dynamics.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe impact of our work will extend far beyond basic science.\n1.  **Interpreting Disease-Associated Genetic Variation:** A major challenge in human genetics is interpreting the function of the ~98% of disease-associated variants that lie in non-coding regions. Our simulation engine will provide a revolutionary tool to address this. By simulating the effects of a non-coding variant on the local epigenome, we can predict its impact on 3D looping and gene regulation, providing a mechanistic link from genotype to phenotype for diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n2.  **Advancing Synthetic Biology and Genome Engineering:** The ability to predictively model genome folding opens the door to forward engineering, or 'genome programming.' Our framework could guide the design of synthetic epigenomes using tools like dCas9-fused epigenetic editors to create bespoke 3D structures, thereby controlling gene expression programs for therapeutic or biotechnological applications.\n3.  **A Lasting Community Resource:** We are committed to Open Science principles. The entire simulation framework, including all code, trained models, and processed data, will be made publicly available through a user-friendly, well-documented open-source platform (e.g., on GitHub and Zenodo). We will provide containerized versions (Docker/Singularity) to ensure reproducibility and ease of use. This will democratize access to sophisticated 4D nucleome modeling.\n\n**Dissemination and Training:**\nWe will pursue a multi-pronged dissemination strategy. Key scientific findings will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Nature, Cell, Science). The computational methods and software will be published in specialized journals (e.g., Nature Methods, Nature Computational Science). We will present our work at major international conferences (e.g., Gordon Research Conferences, Keystone Symposia, ISMB). Crucially, this project is designed as a training vehicle. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the collaboration, gaining unique, transdisciplinary skills at the interface of biology, physics, and computer science. We will host an annual virtual workshop, open to the community, to train other researchers on how to use our tools and approach.\n\n**Long-Term Vision and Sustainability:**\nOur long-term vision is to establish a collaborative, computational hub for the 4D nucleome. The framework developed in this project will be extensible, designed to incorporate new data types (e.g., single-cell Hi-C, live-cell imaging) and more sophisticated modeling approaches as they become available. The working group formed through this NCEMS award will build lasting collaborative relationships, positioning us to secure future funding (e.g., NIH U-series grants) to sustain and expand this community resource long after the initial funding period.",

It is a pure data synthesis project that does not generate new experimental data. The scientific question—uncovering the physical code of genome folding—is fundamental and requires integrating diverse datasets at a scale no single lab could manage. Our team was specifically assembled for this proposal, bringing together world leaders in polymer physics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and molecular biology who have not previously collaborated in this manner. The required computational resources and dedicated project management are substantial. NCEMS support is therefore not just beneficial but essential to catalyze this collaboration and enable a project of this ambition and potential impact."
