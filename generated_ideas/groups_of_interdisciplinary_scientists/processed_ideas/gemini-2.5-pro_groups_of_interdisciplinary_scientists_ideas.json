          "title": "The Grammar of Cellular Architecture: Emergent Organization from Multi-modal Imaging and Proteomics Data Synthesis",
          "abstract": "A fundamental question in cell biology is whether universal principles govern the spatial organization of organelles and protein complexes, giving rise to robust cellular function. This project posits that a 'grammar of cellular architecture' exists, where local molecular interactions and physical constraints lead to emergent, predictable global organization. We propose to decipher this grammar by synthesizing vast, publicly available datasets that are currently siloed. This working group will bring together cell biologists, computer scientists specializing in vision and AI, biophysicists, and systems biologists to integrate high-content imaging data from repositories like the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the Human Cell Atlas with quantitative proteomics data from PRIDE and BioPlex. Our primary objective is to develop a novel computational framework, 'CellArchitect', that uses deep learning to segment and map the 3D spatial distribution and co-localization of thousands of proteins and organelles across millions of cells. By correlating these spatial maps with protein-protein interaction networks and functional annotations, we will move beyond simple co-localization to build predictive models of subcellular organization. We will employ methods from statistical physics and network theory to identify conserved spatial motifs, quantify organizational entropy, and derive rules that predict how perturbations to a single component cascade to alter the entire cellular architecture. This project is beyond the scope of any single lab due to the immense scale of the data and the required diversity of expertise. The outcomes will include a foundational, queryable 4D atlas of the cell, novel algorithms for multi-modal data integration, and fundamental insights into how cellular form and function emerge from molecular parts. This initiative will train a new generation of scientists at the interface of cell imaging, proteomics, and AI, with all models, code, and integrated data products made fully open-access to the scientific community."

          "title": "Viral Hijacking and Host Response: A Pan-viral Synthesis of Host-Pathogen Interactomes",
          "abstract": "Viruses are master manipulators of cellular machinery, but the common principles and evolutionary trade-offs governing their strategies remain poorly understood. This project will address a long-standing puzzle: what are the conserved molecular 'choke points' in the host cell that are targeted by diverse viruses, and how do host defense networks evolve to counter these attacks? We will assemble a multidisciplinary team of virologists, immunologists, bioinformaticians, and evolutionary biologists to conduct a community-scale synthesis of all publicly available host-pathogen interaction data. Our working group will integrate disparate datasets including transcriptomics (GEO, SRA), proteomics (PRIDE), and protein-protein interaction data (BioGRID, IntAct) spanning hundreds of different viral infections in human and other host species. The core of our approach is to build a multi-layered, pan-viral interaction network. We will develop novel graph-based machine learning algorithms to identify 'viral hijacking modules'—sets of host proteins and pathways consistently targeted by unrelated viruses—and corresponding 'emergent host defense modules'—conserved transcriptional and signaling responses that constitute the core of the intrinsic immune system. By comparing the strategies of DNA vs. RNA viruses, or acute vs. persistent viruses, we will uncover the evolutionary logic behind different hijacking strategies. This synthesis is impossible for a single lab, requiring expertise in virology to curate data, computer science to build the network models, and evolutionary biology to interpret the results. The project will produce a comprehensive, open-access 'Viral Interactome Atlas,' providing an invaluable resource for predicting the cellular impact of emerging viruses and identifying novel, broad-spectrum antiviral targets. Trainees will gain unique cross-disciplinary skills in data integration, network biology, and computational virology."

          "title": "Metabolic Symbiosis in the Tumor Microenvironment: A Spatially-Resolved Multi-Omics Data Synthesis",
          "abstract": "A tumor is not a monolith of cancer cells, but a complex ecosystem where diverse cell types—cancer, immune, and stromal—interact dynamically. A key emergent property of this ecosystem is metabolic symbiosis, where cells exchange metabolites to support collective growth, proliferation, and drug resistance. However, mapping these metabolic exchanges remains a major challenge. This project will tackle this challenge by synthesizing publicly available multi-omics data to build the first comprehensive, spatially-resolved metabolic map of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our working group, comprising cancer biologists, biochemists, computational modelers, and data scientists, will integrate genomic and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), proteomic data from CPTAC, and a growing number of public single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets. The central innovation will be the development of a new analytical pipeline that uses machine learning for cellular deconvolution of bulk data and integrates it with single-cell resolution data to assign metabolic pathways to specific cell types within the TME. We will then use constraint-based modeling (e.g., flux balance analysis) to predict the flow of metabolites between these cell populations, identifying critical symbiotic dependencies. This large-scale integration and modeling effort requires a collaborative team to handle the data heterogeneity and develop the sophisticated computational tools needed. The project will reveal how the collective metabolic network of the TME emerges from individual cell behaviors and how this emergent property contributes to cancer progression and therapy failure. Our findings will be disseminated through an open, interactive web portal, providing a powerful new tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets aimed at disrupting this deadly symbiosis. The project will also serve as a training ground for students and postdocs in the burgeoning field of computational systems oncology."

          "title": "From Sequence to Interactome: Predicting Emergent Cellular Functions of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins",
          "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack a stable three-dimensional structure, represent a major puzzle in molecular biology. They are key players in cellular signaling and regulation, often functioning by forming dynamic, multivalent interactions that lead to the emergence of membraneless organelles through liquid-liquid phase separation. This project aims to create a predictive framework that can decipher the 'interaction grammar' of IDPs from their amino acid sequence alone. A transdisciplinary team of structural biologists, polymer physicists, bioinformaticians, and machine learning experts will integrate data from diverse public sources. We will leverage sequence and annotation data from DisProt, structural context from the PDB and AlphaFold DB, known interactions from BioGRID, and post-translational modification (PTM) data from proteomics repositories. The core of our project is to develop a novel deep learning model, inspired by large language models like BERT, that learns the sequence features, motifs, and PTM patterns that determine IDP binding specificity and phase separation propensity. This model will be trained on the integrated dataset to predict IDP interaction partners and the conditions under which they form condensates. The predictions will be used to parameterize polymer physics simulations to explore the emergent material properties of these condensates. This effort is beyond a single lab, requiring the fusion of AI development with deep biophysical and biological domain knowledge. The outcome will be a powerful, open-source tool to predict the functional consequences of mutations in disordered regions, which are frequently implicated in diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration. This will transform our ability to understand how the dynamic, fuzzy interactions of IDPs give rise to the highly organized, emergent behavior of the cell."

          "title": "The Deep Homology of Gene Regulatory Networks: Uncovering the Emergent Logic of Multicellularity",
          "abstract": "The evolution of complex multicellularity occurred independently multiple times across the tree of life, presenting a profound puzzle: are there universal design principles governing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that orchestrate this transition? This project proposes to answer this question by performing the first large-scale comparative analysis of GRNs from a wide phylogenetic range of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Our working group will unite evolutionary biologists, developmental biologists, network scientists, and computational biologists to synthesize a massive collection of public genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data (e.g., from NCBI, ENCODE, and single-cell developmental atlases). We will develop a standardized computational pipeline to reconstruct GRNs for dozens of species, from choanoflagellates and fungi to plants and animals. Using tools from network theory, information theory, and topological data analysis, we will compare these networks to identify conserved architectural features, motifs, and dynamic properties associated with the emergence of multicellular life. We will test specific hypotheses, such as whether the evolution of multicellularity is consistently preceded by an expansion of transcription factor families or the appearance of specific network motifs that enable robust cell differentiation. This community-scale synthesis is essential because it requires a vast amount of data processing and a unique combination of expertise in evolutionary theory and computational network analysis. The project will yield fundamental insights into the 'syntactical' rules that allow simple genetic toolkits to generate the emergent complexity of a multicellular organism. We will create a public 'GRN-Zoo' database and visualization platform, providing a foundational resource for the community and training young scientists in the principles of evolutionary systems biology."

          "title": "CellStateNet: A Foundational Model of Cellular Perturbations to Predict Emergent Phenotypes",
          "abstract": "Predicting cellular response to novel perturbations—such as drugs, mutations, or environmental stimuli—is a grand challenge in biology and medicine. Current approaches are often piecemeal. We propose to build 'CellStateNet,' a foundational AI model for molecular and cellular biology, trained on the entirety of public perturbation-response data. This project will assemble a team of machine learning experts, systems biologists, and pharmacologists to tackle this ambitious goal. The working group will aggregate and harmonize massive datasets, including transcriptomic data from LINCS L1000 and GEO, genetic dependency maps from DepMap and Achilles, and proteomic perturbation data from CPTAC. The core technical innovation will be the development of a multi-modal, self-supervised deep learning architecture that learns a unified, latent representation of cellular state. This model will be trained to predict the outcome of one data modality (e.g., proteomics) from another (e.g., transcriptomics) under a given perturbation. Once trained, CellStateNet will function as a powerful in-silico laboratory. It will be used to predict the effects of novel drug combinations, forecast the phenotypic consequences of uncharacterized genetic variants, and identify synergistic therapeutic strategies. The emergent cellular phenotype is a complex output of the underlying molecular network; our model aims to learn this mapping directly from data at an unprecedented scale. The sheer volume of data and the complexity of the required AI models make this project intractable for a single research group. The resulting pre-trained model, along with all associated code and training pipelines, will be made publicly available, empowering the broader research community to address a vast range of biological questions and accelerating the pace of therapeutic discovery."

          "abstract": "The cell's ability to maintain its shape, move, and divide is an emergent property of the cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of protein polymers, motors, and cross-linkers. While we understand the individual components, how they collectively generate robust, cell-scale mechanical behavior remains a key question. This project will bridge the gap between molecular components and cellular mechanics by creating a multi-scale, data-driven modeling framework. We will form a working group of biophysicists, materials scientists, cell biologists, and computer vision experts to synthesize diverse public data types. We will integrate 3D ultrastructural data of cytoskeletal networks from cryo-electron tomography (EMPIAR), dynamic live-cell imaging data of cytoskeletal components (IDR), quantitative proteomics of cytoskeleton-associated proteins (PRIDE), and cell mechanics measurements from atomic force microscopy (AFM) repositories. Our innovative approach involves using AI-powered segmentation to extract detailed architectural parameters (e.g., filament length, orientation, cross-link density) from tomograms. These structural 'ground truths' will be correlated with protein composition from proteomics data. This integrated information will then be used to parameterize and validate a new generation of agent-based and continuum mechanics models that predict emergent properties like cell stiffness, viscosity, and force generation. This multi-modal data integration and multi-scale modeling is far beyond the capabilities of a single lab. The project will deliver a powerful, predictive model of the cell as a 'living material,' enabling us to understand how molecular-level mutations found in diseases like cancer and muscular dystrophy lead to defects in emergent cellular mechanics. All models and integrated datasets will be shared openly, providing a foundational resource for the mechanobiology community."

          "title": "Decoding the Chemical Lexicon of the Gut Microbiome: Emergent Host-Microbe Communication",
          "abstract": "The gut microbiome profoundly influences host health and disease through a complex chemical dialogue, yet the 'words' of this language—the specific microbial molecules and their effects on host cells—are largely unknown. This project aims to systematically decode this chemical lexicon by integrating public metagenomic, metabolomic, and host transcriptomic data. Our multidisciplinary working group will include microbial ecologists, chemists, bioinformaticians, and immunologists. We will synthesize three key data types: 1) metagenomic data from SRA and MG-RAST to identify biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within microbial genomes, predicting their chemical products; 2) untargeted metabolomics data from MetaboLights and GNPS to identify the actual small molecules present in the gut; and 3) host transcriptomic and proteomic data (GEO, TCGA) from relevant clinical and gnotobiotic animal studies. The central innovation is a novel computational pipeline that probabilistically links BGCs to observed metabolites and correlates the presence of these microbe-derived molecules with specific host gene expression signatures in intestinal and immune cells. Using network inference and machine learning, we will construct a 'Microbe-Metabolite-Host Gene' atlas. This will allow us to understand how community-level changes in the microbiome's genetic potential lead to an emergent chemical environment that, in turn, orchestrates host physiology. The scale of data integration and the need for expertise spanning from microbial genetics to host immunology make this a quintessential community-scale project. The resulting 'Chemical Lexicon Atlas' will be a publicly accessible resource to generate hypotheses about how microbial metabolites drive emergent states of health and diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, paving the way for next-generation microbiome-based therapeutics."

          "abstract": "Aging is not simply the decline of individual cells, but an emergent property of deteriorating cellular ecosystems within tissues. Communication breakdown, altered cellular composition, and microenvironmental changes collectively drive organ dysfunction. This project will create a comprehensive, cross-tissue atlas of aging at single-cell resolution to dissect these emergent phenomena. We will assemble a team of gerontologists, computational biologists, and single-cell genomics experts to synthesize the rapidly growing body of public single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from multiple tissues and organisms (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis, Human Cell Atlas, GTEx). The primary challenge, which requires a collaborative, community-scale effort, is the development of novel computational methods to harmonize and integrate these heterogeneous datasets, correcting for technical batch effects while preserving true biological variation related to age, tissue, and species. Using this integrated atlas, we will first define robust, consensus 'aging signatures' for every major cell type, moving beyond tissue-specific markers. Second, we will apply advanced algorithms for inferring cell-cell communication networks to map how signaling pathways between different cell populations (e.g., immune-stromal, epithelial-fibroblast) are systematically rewired during aging. This will allow us to identify the key intercellular communication failures that precede functional decline. The project will produce a foundational, open-access 'Single-Cell Atlas of Aging,' providing unprecedented insights into how tissue-level senescence emerges from changes in the composition and interaction of its constituent cells. This resource will be invaluable for identifying novel, pan-tissue targets for pro-longevity interventions and will train a cohort of researchers in the complex analysis of large-scale single-cell data."

          "abstract": "The folding of a two-meter long genome into a micron-sized nucleus is a remarkable feat of self-organization. This 3D architecture is not random; it is a key regulator of gene expression, and its disruption is a hallmark of many diseases. This project will address the fundamental question of how the 1D epigenome sequence 'codes' for the emergent 3D chromatin structure. We propose to build a unified, predictive model of genome folding by synthesizing massive public datasets and fostering a novel collaboration between polymer physicists, bioinformaticians, and molecular biologists. Our working group will integrate genome-wide 3D architecture data (Hi-C, from 4DN and ENCODE), 1D epigenomic data (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq), and transcriptional data (RNA-seq) across hundreds of cell types and developmental states. The core of the project is to develop a new generation of data-constrained polymer physics models. We will use machine learning to learn the 'rules' that map specific combinations of histone modifications and protein binding sites to physical parameters in the model, such as local stiffness or interaction affinity. This hybrid AI-physics approach will allow us to simulate how the genome folds and predict how specific epigenomic alterations (e.g., in cancer) lead to changes in 3D structure and emergent gene expression patterns. The complexity of the models and the sheer scale of the data require a concerted effort beyond any single lab. This project will deliver a powerful, open-source simulation engine for the 4D nucleome, transforming our understanding of chromatin from a static blueprint to a dynamic, programmable matter. It will provide fundamental insights into the physical basis of gene regulation and train a new generation of scientists fluent in both the language of biology and physics."
