        "background_and_significance": "Cellular quiescence, or G0, is a state of reversible cell cycle arrest that is fundamental to the biology of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Unlike terminal differentiation or senescence, which represent permanent exits from the cell cycle, quiescence is a dynamic and actively maintained state from which cells can re-enter proliferation in response to appropriate stimuli. This cellular state is not a passive default but an intricate program essential for tissue homeostasis, adult stem cell maintenance, immune memory, and organismal longevity. Dysregulation of quiescence is a hallmark of numerous diseases, including cancer, where dormant tumor cells evade therapy and drive relapse, and aging, which is associated with a decline in the regenerative capacity of quiescent stem cell pools. The current understanding of quiescence has evolved significantly. Initially viewed as a simple absence of proliferation, it is now recognized as a collection of heterogeneous, actively regulated states. Seminal work in model systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) under nutrient limitation, mammalian fibroblasts subjected to serum starvation or contact inhibition, and primary adult stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, HSCs) has revealed key features of the quiescent state. These include profound metabolic reprogramming, characterized by a shift from anabolic to catabolic processes, reduced global transcription and translation, and the establishment of a unique chromatin landscape. Key signaling pathways, most notably the mTOR and insulin/IGF-1 pathways, are known to be major regulators of the quiescence-proliferation decision. However, our knowledge remains remarkably fragmented. The vast majority of studies have focused on a single model system, a specific method of quiescence induction, and often a single omics modality (e.g., transcriptomics). For instance, transcriptomic studies have identified signatures associated with quiescence in HSCs, revealing the importance of transcription factors like FOXO3 and HES1. Proteomic analyses in yeast have highlighted the importance of proteasome remodeling and selective protein synthesis. Similarly, metabolic studies have shown a reliance on fatty acid oxidation in quiescent stem cells. While these individual studies have been invaluable, they have created a collection of context-specific observations without a unifying framework. This fragmentation represents a major gap in the field. There is no consensus on whether a 'core' quiescence program exists that is conserved across the vast evolutionary distance between yeast and humans, and across functionally distinct cell types like a fibroblast and a hematopoietic stem cell. We lack a systems-level, integrated view of how the genome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome are coordinately rewired to establish and maintain this dormant state. Furthermore, the concept of quiescence 'depth'—the idea that some cells are more deeply quiescent and require a stronger stimulus to reactivate—is well-recognized biologically but lacks a quantitative molecular definition. This research is both important and timely due to two converging factors: the explosion of publicly available multi-omics data and the maturation of computational tools for data integration. Repositories like GEO, SRA, and PRIDE now house thousands of datasets relevant to quiescence, a resource far too vast for any single lab to analyze. This proposal outlines a community-scale synthesis project that will leverage this data deluge to address these fundamental gaps. By forming a multidisciplinary working group of cell biologists, systems biologists, and computational scientists, we will perform the first-ever systematic, cross-species, multi-omic integration of quiescence data. This project is perfectly aligned with the research call's mission to synthesize public data to solve long-standing puzzles in molecular and cellular sciences, an endeavor that requires the diverse expertise and collaborative scale that NCEMS is uniquely positioned to support. The outcome will be a universal definition of cellular dormancy, providing transformative insights into fundamental biology and human disease.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research is driven by the central hypothesis that a conserved, universal 'core quiescence program' exists across eukaryotic species and diverse cell types, which is modulated by context-specific regulatory layers to control the entry, maintenance, and depth of the dormant state. To systematically test this overarching hypothesis, we have formulated three specific research questions, each with associated testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes. \n\n**Research Question 1: What are the conserved molecular features that define a universal core quiescence program at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels?**\nThis question addresses the fundamental need for a robust, molecular definition of quiescence that transcends specific biological contexts. \n*   **Hypothesis 1a (Conserved Transcriptional Signature):** We hypothesize that a set of orthologous genes exhibits a consistent pattern of differential expression (up- or down-regulation) in quiescent versus proliferative cells across all studied species and cell types. This signature will reflect the fundamental requirements of dormancy, such as cell cycle arrest, reduced biosynthesis, and enhanced cellular maintenance and stress resistance.\n    *   **Prediction:** A cross-species meta-analysis of transcriptomic datasets will identify a statistically robust gene set whose members are consistently associated with the quiescent state. We predict this set will be enriched for genes involved in cell cycle inhibition (e.g., CDK inhibitors), autophagy, DNA repair, and antioxidant defense, while genes related to ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and glycolysis will be repressed.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b (Conserved Epigenomic Architecture):** We hypothesize that the core quiescence program is underpinned by a conserved chromatin state characterized by global condensation to reduce transcriptional noise, coupled with specific 'poised' domains at key developmental and cell cycle re-entry genes, allowing for rapid reactivation.\n    *   **Prediction:** Integrated analysis of public ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data will reveal common patterns, such as decreased accessibility at promoters of proliferative genes and the maintenance or establishment of bivalent chromatin domains (co-occurrence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) at the promoters of lineage-specifying transcription factors in stem cells.\n\n**Research Question 2: Which signaling and metabolic pathways are universally rewired to establish and maintain the quiescent state?**\nThis question aims to move beyond a list of genes to a functional, systems-level understanding of the regulatory logic of quiescence.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a (Universal Signaling Hubs):** We hypothesize that a small number of key signaling pathways, including mTORC1, Ras/MAPK, and Insulin/IGF-1, act as conserved master integrators of extracellular and intracellular cues to universally control the quiescence-proliferation decision.\n    *   **Prediction:** Integrated analysis of phosphoproteomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data will demonstrate consistent down-regulation of the activity of these pathways in quiescent cells across all contexts. We will identify a core set of downstream phosphorylation targets and transcriptional effectors that are universally regulated by these hubs.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b (Conserved Metabolic Reprogramming):** We hypothesize that quiescent cells universally adopt a catabolic metabolic state to ensure long-term survival, characterized by suppressed anabolic pathways (e.g., glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis) and an increased reliance on catabolic processes (e.g., autophagy, fatty acid oxidation) for energy production and cellular maintenance.\n    *   **Prediction:** Meta-analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data will reveal conserved shifts, including decreased levels of glycolytic intermediates and TCA cycle anaplerotic substrates, and increased expression of genes involved in autophagy (e.g., ATG genes) and fatty acid beta-oxidation (e.g., CPT1).\n\n**Research Question 3: Can a quantitative, multi-omic signature distinguish different 'depths' of quiescence and predict a cell's potential for reactivation?**\nThis question seeks to develop a predictive framework for the functional heterogeneity observed within quiescent populations.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a (Molecular Determinants of Depth):** We hypothesize that the functional depth of quiescence is encoded by a quantitative molecular signature. This signature is not binary but continuous, reflecting graded changes in the abundance of specific cell cycle inhibitors, the degree of chromatin compaction, and the levels of key metabolic enzymes and stored macromolecules.\n    *   **Prediction:** A supervised machine learning model trained on multi-omics data from systems with defined quiescence depths (e.g., short-term vs. long-term starvation; HSCs vs. multipotent progenitors) will be able to accurately predict the reactivation potential of cells from independent datasets. We predict that features such as the expression ratio of CDK inhibitors to cyclins, chromatin accessibility at cell cycle gene promoters, and levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins will be highly predictive.\n\n**Validation and Deliverables:** The hypotheses will be tested through rigorous statistical meta-analysis and validated by assessing the performance of predictive models on held-out, independent datasets. The primary deliverables will be: (1) A validated list of core quiescence genes, proteins, and metabolites; (2) A comprehensive map of the conserved signaling and metabolic networks of quiescence; (3) A robust, validated computational model for predicting quiescence depth; and (4) The 'Quiescence Atlas,' a public web portal integrating all data, models, and visualizations as a lasting community resource.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed in four integrated phases by a multidisciplinary working group with expertise in cell cycle biology (PI 1), stem cell and cancer dormancy (PI 2), systems biology and data integration (PI 3), and machine learning (PI 4). The collaborative framework will involve bi-weekly virtual meetings, annual in-person workshops, and the use of shared platforms like GitHub, Slack, and a common cloud computing environment to ensure seamless integration and cross-pollination of ideas and skills.\n\n**Phase 1: Systematic Data Curation and Harmonization Pipeline Development (Months 1-9)**\nThis foundational phase is critical for ensuring the rigor and reproducibility of our synthesis. The goal is to create a comprehensive, consistently processed, and well-annotated multi-omic dataset of quiescence.\n*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), ArrayExpress, PRIDE, MassIVE, and the Metabolomics Workbench. Search terms will include 'quiescence', 'G0', 'dormancy', 'serum starvation', 'contact inhibition', and specific quiescent cell types (e.g., 'hematopoietic stem cell').\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:** Datasets will be included based on strict criteria: (1) must contain both a quiescent and a corresponding proliferative control sample; (2) must have sufficient biological replicates (n≥2); (3) must have detailed, parsable metadata on species, cell type, quiescence induction method, and duration; (4) must pass initial quality control checks.\n*   **Data Types:** We will target datasets across four omics layers: transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq), epigenomics (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3), proteomics (quantitative mass spectrometry, phosphoproteomics), and metabolomics (LC-MS, GC-MS).\n*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** A key innovation of this project is the development of a standardized computational pipeline to mitigate technical variability. Raw data (e.g., FASTQ, .raw files) will be uniformly reprocessed using community-standard, containerized workflows (e.g., nf-core pipelines for genomics, MaxQuant for proteomics). This eliminates variability from different primary analysis software and parameters. Metadata will be standardized using controlled vocabularies. For cross-species analysis, human, mouse, and yeast genes/proteins will be mapped to ortholog groups using the Ensembl Compara database. Finally, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq, Harmony) to the processed data to remove study-specific technical effects while preserving the biological signal of quiescence.\n\n**Phase 2: Integrative Analysis to Define the Core Quiescence Program (Months 10-24)**\nWith the harmonized data, we will address our first two research questions.\n*   **Aim 1 (Molecular Signature):** To identify the core transcriptional signature, we will first perform differential expression analysis within each dataset. We will then use robust meta-analysis methods (e.g., Rank Product, fixed and random-effects models) to combine effect sizes and p-values across all datasets and species, identifying genes with consistent changes. For multi-omic integration, we will use unsupervised methods like Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA+) or weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) applied to the combined data matrix to identify co-regulated modules of genes, proteins, and accessible chromatin regions that define quiescence.\n*   **Aim 2 (Pathway and Network Analysis):** The identified core signatures will be subjected to pathway enrichment analysis (e.g., GSEA, ReactomePA) to pinpoint conserved biological processes. To understand the regulatory logic, we will construct a multi-layer network by integrating our findings with public protein-protein interaction (STRING), kinase-substrate (PhosphoSitePlus), and metabolic pathway (KEGG, Recon3D) databases. Network topology analysis will be used to identify key hub proteins and regulatory nodes that orchestrate the quiescent state.\n\n**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling of Quiescence Depth (Months 18-30)**\nThis phase focuses on developing a quantitative, predictive understanding of quiescence heterogeneity.\n*   **Model Training:** We will curate a specific training dataset where quiescence 'depth' can be assigned a semi-quantitative label based on metadata (e.g., 1=short-term starvation, 2=long-term starvation, 3=primary HSCs). Using the harmonized multi-omic data as features, we will train a suite of supervised machine learning models (e.g., Elastic Net regression, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests) to predict this depth score. Feature selection techniques will be employed to identify the most informative molecular predictors.\n*   **Model Validation:** The model's performance will be rigorously assessed using cross-validation and testing on completely held-out datasets. We will further validate its biological relevance by correlating the predicted depth score with experimental readouts from the literature, such as the time required for cell cycle re-entry or colony-forming ability, which were not used during training.\n\n**Phase 4: Dissemination via the 'Quiescence Atlas' (Months 24-36)**\nTo ensure maximum impact and adherence to open science principles, all findings will be disseminated through a public web portal.\n*   **Atlas Development:** We will build a user-friendly web application using frameworks like R Shiny or Dash. The Atlas will allow users to search, browse, and visualize all curated and processed data. It will feature interactive tools to explore the core quiescence signature, query the multi-layer network, and use our predictive model to score new user-supplied data.\n*   **Open Science:** All analysis code and workflows will be version-controlled on GitHub and documented for reproducibility. All harmonized data matrices and model objects will be deposited in Zenodo. This ensures our entire research process is transparent, reproducible, and reusable by the broader community.\n\n**Timeline & Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of data curation and the harmonization pipeline (M1); preliminary identification of the core transcriptional signature.\n*   **Year 2:** Completion of multi-omic integration and network analysis (M2); development and initial validation of the quiescence depth model.\n*   **Year 3:** Final model refinement and external validation; public launch of the Quiescence Atlas (M3); submission of the primary manuscript.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to produce transformative outcomes that will reshape our understanding of cellular quiescence, with significant and lasting impacts on both fundamental biology and translational research. The synthesis-driven approach will generate novel insights and resources that are unattainable by individual research labs.\n\n**Expected Outcomes and Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **The First Unified, Multi-Omic Definition of Quiescence:** The primary outcome will be the identification and rigorous validation of a 'core quiescence program'—a conserved molecular signature of genes, proteins, epigenetic marks, and metabolic states that defines cellular dormancy across species and cell types. This will shift the paradigm from a collection of disparate, context-dependent descriptions to a fundamental, systems-level definition. This foundational knowledge will provide a common framework for the entire field, enabling researchers to compare results from different systems in a standardized way.\n2.  **A Comprehensive Map of Quiescence Regulation:** We will deliver a detailed map of the conserved signaling and metabolic networks that govern the entry into, maintenance of, and exit from quiescence. This network model will illuminate the hierarchical control structures and feedback loops, identifying universal master regulators and critical nodes. This will generate a wealth of specific, testable hypotheses for the experimental community to pursue, driving the field forward for years to come.\n3.  **A Novel Predictive Tool for Quiescence Depth:** Our machine learning model for predicting quiescence 'depth' will be a significant conceptual and practical advance. It will provide the first quantitative, molecularly-based tool to measure a critical biological property that has, until now, been only qualitatively described. This tool will allow researchers to stratify quiescent cell populations, predict their regenerative potential, and understand the molecular basis of functional heterogeneity.\n4.  **The 'Quiescence Atlas': A Lasting Community Resource:** A major deliverable is the creation of the Quiescence Atlas, a public, interactive web portal. This resource will democratize access to the vast, integrated dataset we assemble. It will serve as a central hub for the quiescence research community, enabling hypothesis generation, data exploration, and re-analysis. By adhering to FAIR data principles, the Atlas will be a durable and invaluable asset that lowers the barrier to entry for data-driven research in this area.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe fundamental insights generated will have far-reaching implications for human health.\n*   **Oncology:** Dormant cancer cells are a primary driver of therapeutic resistance and metastatic relapse. Our core signature and depth model could lead to biomarkers to identify these dangerous cells and reveal novel therapeutic targets within the conserved maintenance pathways to eradicate them.\n*   **Regenerative Medicine:** The ability to control stem cell quiescence is paramount for therapies involving cell transplantation and tissue engineering. Our findings could inform protocols to maintain stem cells in a potent, deeply quiescent state during ex vivo culture or to precisely control their activation for enhanced tissue repair.\n*   **Aging:** The age-related decline in tissue function is linked to both stem cell exhaustion and the accumulation of senescent cells. Our work will provide clear molecular discriminators between functional quiescence and irreversible senescence, helping to elucidate the mechanisms of aging and potentially suggesting interventions to preserve regenerative capacity.\n\n**Dissemination, Training, and Collaboration:**\nOur dissemination strategy is multifaceted. We will publish our main findings in a high-impact, open-access journal. We will present our work at key international conferences to engage with the scientific community. Crucially, the Quiescence Atlas itself is a primary tool for dissemination. In line with the research call's goals, this project is an ideal training vehicle. Graduate students and postdocs will gain unique, cross-disciplinary skills in big data analysis, systems biology, and open science practices, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy workforce. We will host workshops to train the broader community on our analytical pipelines and the use of the Atlas. The working group structure will forge lasting collaborations among the participating labs, and the Atlas will serve as a catalyst for new collaborations between computational and experimental researchers across the globe. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to become a community-maintained and -expanded resource, with a sustainability plan involving follow-on funding to incorporate new data types and cellular states, ensuring its enduring impact on the molecular and cellular sciences.",

        "background_and_significance": "The completion of the Human Genome Project ushered in the post-genomic era, yet a fundamental challenge remains: a substantial portion of the human proteome is functionally uncharacterized. Despite decades of research, it is estimated that nearly one-third of the ~20,000 human proteins have poorly understood or completely unknown functions. These Proteins of Unknown Function (PUFs), often referred to as the 'dark proteome,' represent a major gap in our knowledge of human biology, hindering our ability to understand cellular networks, disease mechanisms, and to develop novel therapeutics. This proposal addresses this long-standing puzzle by synthesizing a diverse array of public data to systematically illuminate the functions of these enigmatic proteins.\n\nCurrent approaches to protein function prediction have laid important groundwork but possess significant limitations. Traditional sequence-based methods, such as BLAST and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles from databases like Pfam, are powerful for identifying homologs but often fail for PUFs that lack conserved sequence motifs or belong to novel protein families. Structure-based methods, which infer function from 3D structural similarity, were historically limited by the slow pace of experimental structure determination. The recent revolution in protein structure prediction, spearheaded by AlphaFold2, has changed this landscape. The availability of high-quality predicted structures for the entire human proteome via the AlphaFold Database (AFDB) presents an unprecedented opportunity to identify distant evolutionary relationships and functional sites that are invisible at the sequence level. However, structure alone is often insufficient to pinpoint a protein's precise biological role.\n\nTo overcome this, researchers have turned to 'guilt-by-association' principles using systems-level data. Large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps from databases like BioGRID and STRING place proteins in the context of physical interaction networks, suggesting that interacting proteins often share functions. Similarly, co-expression networks, derived from massive transcriptomic datasets like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the Human Cell Atlas, link genes that are transcriptionally coordinated, often implying participation in the same pathway. Other powerful data types include phylogenetic profiling, which infers functional linkages from patterns of co-evolution across species, and large-scale phenotypic screens like the Dependency Map (DepMap), which reveal genes essential for cell survival under specific conditions. While several platforms, such as STRING and GeneMANIA, have successfully integrated some of these data types, they face key limitations. First, none have systematically incorporated the new wave of proteome-scale structural data from AlphaFold. Second, they often use heuristic scoring schemes, making it difficult to assess the statistical confidence of a prediction or to understand the contribution of individual evidence types. Finally, the sheer scale, heterogeneity, and rapid growth of these public datasets make their comprehensive integration a grand challenge that is beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory. This project is therefore both important and timely. It is important because de-orphanizing PUFs is critical for advancing fundamental biology and translational medicine. It is timely because the recent convergence of high-quality predicted structures, massive single-cell atlases, and comprehensive dependency maps provides the raw material for a transformative leap in functional genomics. By assembling a transdisciplinary working group to develop a rigorous, probabilistic framework for data synthesis, we can finally begin to systematically map the dark proteome and unlock its secrets.",

This community-scale effort is guided by a set of specific research questions and testable hypotheses designed to rigorously assess the power of data synthesis and generate novel biological insights.\n\n**Primary Research Questions:**\n\n*   **RQ1: The Synergy of Data Integration:** To what extent does the synergistic integration of predicted 3D structures, protein-protein interaction networks, tissue- and cell-type-specific co-expression profiles, phylogenetic patterns, and genome-wide phenotypic screens improve the accuracy, coverage, and specificity of functional predictions for human PUFs compared to any single-data-type approach or existing integrative methods?\n*   **RQ2: A Probabilistic Framework for Evidence Synthesis:** How can a Bayesian statistical framework be optimally designed to quantitatively weigh evidence from fundamentally heterogeneous data sources? This involves learning the conditional probabilities of observing specific data features (e.g., a structural hit to a kinase domain, co-expression with cell cycle genes) given a specific function, thereby generating a unified, interpretable, and probabilistic functional annotation for each protein.\n*   **RQ3: Discovery of Novel Biological Modules:** What novel biological pathways, protein complexes, and functional modules can be discovered by applying this integrative framework to systematically analyze PUFs in the context of the known proteome? Can we identify PUFs that act as 'missing links' connecting previously disparate cellular processes?\n*   **RQ4: Prioritization for Experimental Validation:** Can our integrative approach effectively prioritize PUFs that are likely involved in critical cellular processes (e.g., DNA repair, autophagy, immune response) or human diseases, thereby generating a high-value, community-accessible roadmap of testable hypotheses for experimental biologists?\n\n**Testable Hypotheses and Validation Strategy:**\n\n*   **H1: Superior Predictive Performance:** We hypothesize that a multi-modal model integrating all five proposed data modalities will achieve significantly higher precision and recall in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms than any model based on a single data modality or a subset of modalities. \n    *   **Validation:** This hypothesis will be tested using a rigorous cross-validation strategy. We will construct a 'gold standard' set of well-characterized proteins, withhold a fraction for testing, and train our models on the remainder. Performance will be benchmarked using metrics like the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). We predict our full integrative model will outperform the best single-modality model by at least 20% in AUPRC, demonstrating a strong synergistic effect. An ablation study, systematically removing each data type, will quantify its unique contribution.\n*   **H2: Confidence Correlates with Accuracy:** We hypothesize that the posterior probabilities generated by our Bayesian framework will serve as accurate confidence scores. Predictions supported by multiple, independent lines of evidence will receive higher probabilities and will be more likely to be correct.\n    *   **Validation:** We will stratify our predictions for the test set by their posterior probability scores (e.g., <0.5, 0.5-0.7, 0.7-0.9, >0.9). We predict a strong monotonic relationship between the probability bin and the precision of the predictions within that bin. This will validate the framework's ability to provide users with a reliable measure of confidence.\n*   **H3: Revealing Network Topologies:** We hypothesize that network analysis incorporating our high-confidence functional predictions for PUFs will reveal their non-random integration into the human interactome, identifying them as previously unknown hubs, bottlenecks, or bridges in cellular networks.\n    *   **Validation:** We will construct an integrated functional association network and analyze the topological properties of newly annotated PUFs. We predict we will identify at least 50 PUFs that significantly increase the connectivity or information flow between known functional modules, and these predictions will be supported by multiple data types. We will use literature mining to seek corroborating evidence for a subset of these topological predictions.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a transdisciplinary working group with expertise in structural biology, bioinformatics, network science, and machine learning. The approach is organized into three phases: (1) Data Acquisition and Harmonization, (2) Development of the Integrative Inference Engine, and (3) Analysis, Dissemination, and Community Engagement. This project exclusively uses publicly available data and does not involve new experimental data generation, perfectly aligning with the research call's focus on data synthesis.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Pre-processing, and Harmonization (Months 1-9)**\nThis foundational phase involves assembling and standardizing the diverse datasets that will fuel the inference engine. All data will be versioned and all processing scripts will be made publicly available.\n*   **Structural Data:** We will download the complete set of human protein structure predictions from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB). We will use high-performance structural alignment tools like FoldSeek to systematically compare each PUF structure against a comprehensive library of experimentally determined structures from the PDB, annotated with functional domain information from CATH and SCOP. The output will be a matrix of structural similarity scores for each PUF against all known structural domains.\n*   **Interaction & Association Data:** We will aggregate multiple large-scale PPI databases (BioGRID, STRING, HuRI, IntAct) into a unified, weighted human interactome. Confidence scores will be harmonized onto a common scale. Similarly, we will process bulk RNA-seq data from GTEx and single-cell RNA-seq data from the Human Cell Atlas to build context-specific co-expression networks, using metrics like Pearson correlation and mutual information.\n*   **Phylogenetic & Phenotypic Data:** We will construct phylogenetic profiles (vectors of presence/absence across ~2,000 diverse species) for all human proteins using OrthoDB. Co-evolution between proteins will be calculated based on the similarity of their profiles. From the DepMap portal, we will acquire gene dependency and genetic interaction profiles from genome-wide CRISPR screens across hundreds of cancer cell lines.\n*   **Ground Truth Annotations:** We will use the Gene Ontology (GO) as our functional vocabulary. To create a high-confidence 'gold standard' for training and validation, we will use GO annotations supported by experimental or curated evidence, excluding purely electronic annotations (IEA).\n\n**Phase 2: The Bayesian Inference Engine (Months 7-24)**\nThis is the core methodological innovation of the project. We will develop a probabilistic framework to integrate the heterogeneous evidence.\n*   **Feature Engineering:** For each protein and each data modality, we will generate a feature vector that summarizes its relationship to known functions. For example, the PPI feature vector for a PUF will represent its connectivity strength to proteins associated with every GO term.\n*   **Bayesian Framework:** We will implement a Naive Bayes classifier, a well-established and interpretable machine learning model. For each PUF and each potential function (GO term) *F*, we will calculate the posterior probability P(F | D_struct, D_ppi, D_coex, D_phylo, D_pheno). This is proportional to the prior probability of the function, P(F), multiplied by the likelihood of observing the data for each modality given that function, Π P(D_i | F). The likelihood terms will be learned from our gold-standard set of well-characterized proteins. This framework elegantly handles missing data and provides a natural, interpretable confidence score (the posterior probability) for each prediction.\n*   **Network-based Refinement:** The initial Bayesian predictions will be further refined using network propagation algorithms (e.g., random walk with restart) on an integrated functional network. This allows functional information to flow from well-characterized proteins to their network neighbors, boosting confidence in predictions for PUFs that are tightly clustered with proteins of a known function.\n\n**Phase 3: Analysis, Dissemination, and Training (Months 25-36)**\n*   **Timeline and Milestones:**\n    *   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and harmonization (M9). Develop and benchmark single-modality predictors (M12). First in-person working group meeting.\n    *   **Year 2:** Implement and validate the full Bayesian integration engine (M18). Generate first proteome-wide set of predictions (M24). Begin development of the public web portal. Second in-person meeting.\n    *   **Year 3:** Launch beta version of the web portal for community feedback (M30). Submit primary manuscript and database resource paper (M36). Host a virtual training workshop. Final meeting to plan for long-term sustainability.\n*   **Open Science:** All code will be developed in a public GitHub repository under a permissive license. Analysis workflows will be containerized (Docker) and managed with Snakemake to ensure full reproducibility. All generated data and predictions will be deposited in Zenodo and made accessible through the portal.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will produce a suite of transformative resources, methodologies, and biological insights that will significantly advance the molecular and cellular sciences. Its impact will be felt across basic and translational research by addressing the fundamental problem of protein function annotation at an unprecedented scale.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n1.  **A Comprehensive Functional Annotation Resource:** The primary outcome will be a publicly accessible, interactive web portal providing the most comprehensive functional predictions for the human proteome to date. For thousands of PUFs, this resource will offer specific, evidence-based hypotheses regarding their molecular function, biological process, and subcellular localization. Each prediction will be accompanied by a confidence score and a detailed breakdown of the supporting evidence from each data modality, empowering researchers to make informed decisions about experimental follow-up.\n2.  **A Novel, Open-Source Integration Framework:** We will deliver a robust, open-source computational pipeline for multi-modal data integration and functional inference. This Bayesian framework will serve as a methodological blueprint for the field, adaptable for other species or different types of biological questions. Its open and reproducible nature ensures its long-term utility and extensibility by the broader scientific community.\n3.  **High-Confidence Biological Hypotheses:** We anticipate generating specific, testable hypotheses for hundreds of PUFs. For example, we might predict that a PUF with structural similarity to a ubiquitin ligase, which is co-expressed with proteasome components and whose knockout confers resistance to a proteasome inhibitor, is a novel component of the protein degradation machinery. We will highlight a curated list of the top 100 most promising PUF annotations to catalyze experimental validation.\n\n**Broader Impact and Applications:**\n*   **Accelerating Discovery in Basic Biology:** Our resource will act as a hypothesis generator for the entire biological research community. A cell biologist studying mitosis who identifies a PUF in their screen can instantly access our portal to see if it is predicted to be a novel kinase or a microtubule-associated protein, dramatically accelerating the pace of their research.\n*   **Enabling Translational and Clinical Research:** Understanding protein function is paramount for understanding disease. Our work will help interpret data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and clinical proteomics by providing functional context for previously unannotated genes and proteins linked to disease. Furthermore, by identifying novel enzymes, receptors, or signaling proteins, we will expand the 'druggable' proteome, revealing new potential targets for therapeutic intervention.\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. Graduate students and postdocs in the working group will gain invaluable cross-disciplinary skills in computational structural biology, network analysis, machine learning, and open, team-based science. We will further broaden our training impact by developing tutorials and hosting a virtual workshop to teach the wider community how to use our tools and interpret the results, fostering a more data-savvy workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Sustainability Plan:**\nOur dissemination strategy is multi-pronged. The primary vehicle is the open-access web portal. We will also publish our findings in high-impact journals (*Nature*, *Science*, *Nature Methods*) and present at key international conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, ASCB). To ensure long-term sustainability, the portal will be designed for automated quarterly updates as its underlying data sources are refreshed. The open-source code and containerized workflows will allow the resource to live on and be maintained by the community. We will seek follow-on funding from NIH or other agencies to support the portal's long-term maintenance and to expand its scope to other model organisms, solidifying its role as a cornerstone resource in functional genomics.",

        "background_and_significance": "The compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells into membrane-bound organelles is a foundational concept in biology. However, a paradigm shift is underway, revealing that cells also employ a vast network of membrane-less organelles, or biomolecular condensates, to organize their cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. These dynamic, fluid-like assemblies form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a physical process where multivalent macromolecules, primarily proteins and nucleic acids, de-mix from the surrounding solution to form a condensed phase. This emergent phenomenon allows cells to concentrate specific molecules, thereby accelerating biochemical reactions, sequestering components, and organizing complex cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, RNA processing in P-bodies, and the stress response in stress granules. The discovery of LLPS as a widespread organizing principle has revolutionized our understanding of cellular function and dysfunction. Aberrant phase transitions are increasingly implicated in a range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, where liquid condensates pathologically mature into solid, fibrillar aggregates, as well as in various cancers where condensates can drive oncogenic transcription programs. Despite the rapid expansion of the field, our knowledge remains largely descriptive and fragmented. The 'molecular grammar'—the set of rules that determines which proteins can phase separate, what partners they recruit into a condensate, and how these processes are regulated—is still poorly understood. Current research has identified key drivers of LLPS, particularly proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low-complexity domains (LCDs). These regions lack stable tertiary structure and engage in numerous weak, transient interactions (e.g., pi-pi stacking, cation-pi, electrostatic interactions) that collectively drive phase separation. Several computational tools have been developed to predict LLPS propensity based on these sequence features (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE). However, these first-generation predictors are often trained on limited datasets of well-studied proteins and typically neglect other critical factors. For instance, structured domains can act as scaffolds or interaction hubs within condensates, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation are known to be potent regulators, capable of dissolving or promoting condensate formation by altering a protein's charge and interaction capabilities. The key limitation in the field is the lack of data integration. A wealth of publicly available data exists that could inform a more holistic model of LLPS, but it resides in disparate databases. Protein sequences and IDR annotations are in UniProt and DisProt; PTM data is in PhosphoSitePlus; protein structures are in the PDB and AlphaFold DB; protein-protein interactions are in BioGRID and STRING; and cellular localization patterns are captured in high-content imaging datasets like the Human Protein Atlas and the Image Data Resource. No single research lab possesses the diverse expertise required to effectively mine, integrate, and synthesize these multimodal data types. This project is therefore both important and timely. It is important because a predictive, systems-level understanding of the cellular 'condensatome' would provide a powerful framework for generating hypotheses about cellular function in health and disease. It is timely because the recent explosion in publicly available biological data, particularly the proteome-wide structural predictions from AlphaFold, presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally decode the grammar of LLPS. By assembling a multidisciplinary working group of biophysicists, cell biologists, and data scientists, this project will perform the community-scale synthesis needed to bridge this critical knowledge gap, moving the field from a collection of individual examples to a comprehensive, predictive science.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, integrative computational framework to predict the composition, regulation, and functional context of the cellular 'condensatome'. We will achieve this by addressing three fundamental, interconnected research questions, each associated with a specific, testable hypothesis. Our approach is designed to synthesize fragmented public data into a unified predictive model, creating a powerful resource for the entire molecular and cellular biology community. \n\n**Research Question 1: What are the universal sequence, structural, and physicochemical features that accurately predict a protein's intrinsic propensity to undergo LLPS across the human proteome?**\nWhile IDRs and LCDs are known drivers, many structured proteins also participate in LLPS, and the specific combination of features that confers this ability remains elusive. We need to move beyond simple sequence metrics to a more holistic model.\n*   **Hypothesis 1 (H1):** An integrative machine learning model, trained on a synthesized dataset of protein sequence features (IDR length, amino acid composition, charge patterning), structural features (solvent accessibility, domain architecture from PDB/AlphaFold), and biophysical properties, will significantly outperform existing single-feature predictors in identifying LLPS-prone proteins.\n*   **Prediction:** Our multi-modal model will achieve an Area Under the Curve (AUC) greater than 0.9 on a rigorously curated, held-out test set of experimentally validated phase-separating and non-phase-separating proteins. This would represent a substantial improvement in predictive power over existing tools.\n*   **Validation:** The model's predictive performance will be benchmarked against all publicly available LLPS predictors. Crucially, we will perform prospective validation by testing its predictions against newly published experimental data that was not used during training or testing. The model will generate a ranked list of novel, high-confidence LLPS candidates, which will be a key deliverable for community-led experimental validation.\n\n**Research Question 2: How can we systematically predict the composition of specific biomolecular condensates by integrating protein-protein interaction, co-expression, and co-localization data?**\nCondensates are complex, multi-component bodies, but their complete parts lists are largely unknown. We aim to develop a method to predict the network of 'scaffolds' (drivers of LLPS) and 'clients' (recruited components) that constitute a given condensate.\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (H2):** A network-based model that integrates physical protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, gene co-expression profiles, and spatial co-localization scores derived from high-content imaging can predict the core components and transient clients of known condensates with high precision and recall.\n*   **Prediction:** For well-characterized condensates like stress granules and P-bodies, our model will correctly identify over 80% of known core components while also predicting novel, high-confidence members that are functionally related.\n*   **Validation:** We will validate our predicted condensate compositions by comparing them against published mass spectrometry-based proteomics of purified condensates. Furthermore, we will use Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses to assess the functional coherence of our predicted condensate modules, expecting to see significant enrichment for relevant biological processes.\n\n**Research Question 3: What is the regulatory code of PTMs that governs the dynamic assembly and disassembly of condensates, and can we predict which PTMs are key modulators?**\nPTMs are critical for the dynamic control of LLPS, but a systematic understanding of which PTMs regulate which proteins is missing. We seek to build a model that can predict the functional impact of a PTM on a protein's phase separation behavior.\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (H3):** Specific PTMs, particularly phosphorylation within or flanking IDRs, act as context-dependent molecular 'switches' for LLPS. A model incorporating PTM site information, local sequence context, predicted structural changes, and evolutionary conservation will accurately predict the regulatory effect (promotion vs. inhibition) of a given PTM.\n*   **Prediction:** The model will correctly classify the functional effect of over 75% of known regulatory PTMs curated from the literature. Applied proteome-wide, it will predict thousands of novel regulatory PTM sites.\n*   **Validation:** We will cross-reference our predictions with large-scale phosphoproteomics datasets from studies involving stimuli known to alter cellular organization (e.g., stress, cell cycle progression). We will test for a statistically significant correlation between the phosphorylation status of our predicted regulatory sites and the experimental conditions. The resulting ranked list of predicted regulatory PTMs will be a primary deliverable, providing a rich set of testable hypotheses for experimentalists.",

The project will be executed in three overlapping phases, guided by our three research questions. Our approach is designed to be modular, iterative, and fully aligned with open science principles.\n\n**Working Group and Project Management:**\nThe working group will consist of three core teams. The **Biophysics Team** will guide the selection and engineering of physicochemical features relevant to LLPS, ensuring our models are grounded in physical principles. The **Cell Biology Team** will lead the curation of 'gold standard' training and validation datasets from the literature and provide crucial biological context for interpreting model outputs. The **Data Science Team** will lead the development of the data integration pipeline, machine learning models, and the public-facing web portal. The project will be managed through bi-weekly virtual meetings, a shared project management platform (e.g., Asana), and annual in-person workshops to facilitate deep collaboration and training.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Integration, and Curation (Months 1-12)**\nThis foundational phase involves building a comprehensive, integrated database that will serve as the input for all subsequent modeling. We will use only publicly available data.\n*   **Data Sources:**\n    *   **Sequence & Disorder:** Human proteome sequences from UniProt; IDR predictions from DisProt and IUPred2.\n    *   **Biophysical Features:** Custom Python scripts will be used to calculate sequence-level features like amino acid composition, sequence complexity (SCD), charge patterning (SCD, κ), and hydrophobicity.\n    *   **Structural Features:** We will systematically process all human protein structures from the PDB and the AlphaFold DB. We will use tools like DSSP and NACCESS to compute secondary structure and solvent accessibility. We will also featurize domain architectures from Pfam.\n    *   **PTM Data:** Data on experimentally verified PTMs, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, will be aggregated from PhosphoSitePlus, UniProt, and dbPTM.\n    *   **Interaction & Expression Data:** Physical PPIs will be sourced from BioGRID, STRING, and IntAct. Co-expression data will be derived from large-scale RNA-seq datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).\n    *   **Localization Data:** We will leverage the subcellular localization annotations from the Human Protein Atlas. For quantitative co-localization, we will develop an automated image analysis pipeline using CellProfiler to process high-content imaging screens from the Image Data Resource (IDR), quantifying the degree to which proteins form puncta and co-localize.\n*   **Curation of 'Ground Truth' Sets:** The Cell Biology Team will perform an extensive literature review to curate a high-confidence set of ~500 human proteins with strong experimental evidence for undergoing LLPS and a matched set of non-phase-separating proteins. This will form our 'gold standard' for training and testing the LLPS propensity model (H1).\n\n**Phase 2: Predictive Modeling (Months 10-30)**\n*   **Model for H1 (LLPS Propensity):** We will develop a machine learning classifier to distinguish LLPS-prone proteins from the rest of the proteome. We will employ a gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) due to its high performance and interpretability. All integrated features from Phase 1 will be used as input. The model will be trained using 5-fold cross-validation on 80% of the 'gold standard' set, with the remaining 20% held out for final testing. We will use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret the model, identifying the key features that drive LLPS prediction.\n*   **Model for H2 (Condensate Composition):** We will construct a weighted, multi-layer protein network. An unsupervised approach using community detection algorithms (e.g., Leiden algorithm) will be used for de novo discovery of condensate-like modules. In parallel, we will use a supervised approach, training a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the network neighborhoods of known condensate components to predict new members for those and other condensates.\n*   **Model for H3 (PTM Regulation):** We will create a dataset where each instance is a known PTM. Features will include the type of PTM, the physicochemical property change it induces, the local sequence and structural context (e.g., within an IDR, on a protein surface), and evolutionary conservation of the site. We will train a multi-class classifier (e.g., Random Forest) to predict the PTM's effect as 'promoting', 'inhibiting', or 'no effect' on LLPS.\n\n**Phase 3: Synthesis, Dissemination, and Training (Months 24-36)**\n*   **The Condensatome Atlas:** The predictions from all three models will be integrated to create a comprehensive atlas of the human condensatome. This atlas will provide, for every protein, its predicted LLPS propensity, its predicted condensate partners, and the PTMs predicted to regulate its behavior.\n*   **Web Portal:** We will develop a user-friendly, open-access web portal to host the atlas. The portal will allow users to search for their protein of interest, view all associated predictions in an intuitive graphical format, and download the underlying data.\n*   **Open Science:** All curated data, source code for analysis and modeling, and the models themselves will be made publicly available through GitHub and Zenodo repositories with permissive licenses, ensuring full reproducibility and adherence to FAIR principles.\n\n**Timeline & Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of data integration pipeline and 'gold standard' dataset curation. First working group meeting.\n*   **Year 2:** Development and validation of H1 and H2 models. Beta version of the web portal. Presentation of initial results at a major conference.\n*   **Year 3:** Development and validation of H3 model. Full public release of the Condensatome Atlas and web portal.

This resource alone will be invaluable, saving individual labs countless hours of data wrangling and enabling novel analyses.\n2.  **A Suite of Advanced Predictive Models:** We will deliver three open-source, state-of-the-art machine learning models: one to predict a protein's intrinsic LLPS propensity, a second to predict the composition of condensate communities, and a third to predict the regulatory impact of PTMs on LLPS. These tools will provide a multi-layered, systems-level view of phase separation.\n3.  **The Human 'Condensatome' Atlas:** The synthesis of our model predictions will culminate in a comprehensive, first-draft atlas of the human condensatome. This atlas, accessible via a user-friendly web portal, will provide a global map of membrane-less organization within the cell, highlighting known condensates and predicting hundreds of novel ones.\n4.  **Training of a New Generation of Scientists:** Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are central to this project. They will receive unique cross-disciplinary training at the interface of biophysics, cell biology, and data science, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy scientific workforce.\n\n**Scientific Impact and Contribution to the Field:**\nOur project will provide a unifying framework for understanding the principles of LLPS. By identifying the key combinations of features that drive phase separation and its regulation, we will help to finally decode the 'molecular grammar' of this fundamental process. The Condensatome Atlas will generate thousands of specific, testable hypotheses. For example, it might predict that a previously uncharacterized metabolic enzyme is a core component of stress granules, suggesting a direct link between metabolic state and the stress response. This will empower individual research labs to design targeted experiments, dramatically accelerating the pace of discovery. Our work will provide crucial context for interpreting large-scale datasets, such as identifying which hits in a genetic screen are likely to function by altering condensate properties.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nGiven the strong links between aberrant phase separation and disease, our work has significant translational potential. The predictive models can be used to systematically analyze the impact of disease-associated mutations. For instance, we can predict whether a mutation found in an ALS patient alters a protein's LLPS propensity or disrupts a key regulatory PTM site, providing a mechanistic hypothesis for its pathogenicity. This will aid in prioritizing variants of unknown significance from clinical sequencing studies. Furthermore, by identifying the key drivers and regulatory nodes of disease-relevant condensates, our atlas could reveal novel therapeutic targets for developing drugs that modulate condensate formation or dissolution.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**\nWe are committed to rapid and broad dissemination. Our findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. The primary vehicle for impact, however, will be the public web portal, which will make our data and predictions immediately accessible to all. We will present our work at major international conferences and organize workshops to train the community on using our tools. Our long-term vision is for this resource to become the definitive, 'go-to' platform for LLPS research, analogous to the STRING database for protein interactions or the Gene Ontology consortium for gene function. The collaborative network established by this working group will be sustained beyond the funding period, with plans to continuously update the atlas as new public data becomes available, ensuring its lasting value to the scientific community.",

        "background_and_significance": "The transition from simple prokaryotic cells to complex eukaryotic cells, known as eukaryogenesis, represents one of the most significant and enigmatic events in evolutionary history. This transition, which occurred over two billion years ago, established the cellular architecture that underpins all visible life, including fungi, plants, and animals. Eukaryotic cells are defined by a suite of complex innovations absent in prokaryotes, such as a membrane-bound nucleus, mitochondria, an extensive endomembrane system for trafficking and secretion, a dynamic cytoskeleton, and sophisticated regulatory networks like the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Understanding the origin of these features is a grand challenge in modern biology. The prevailing theory of eukaryogenesis posits a symbiotic merger between an archaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont that evolved into the mitochondrion. Recent discoveries of the Asgard archaea, which possess genes for many 'eukaryotic signature proteins' (ESPs), have provided unprecedented insight into the nature of the archaeal host, suggesting it was already primed for complexity. However, these discoveries have primarily focused on reconstructing the genomic 'parts list' of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), the hypothetical organism from which all extant eukaryotes descend. Seminal studies have successfully inferred the gene content of LECA, revealing a complex proteome with thousands of protein families involved in uniquely eukaryotic functions. While this 'parts list' is foundational, it is critically insufficient for understanding cellular function. Complexity does not arise from the mere presence of components, but from the intricate network of interactions among them. A cell's proteome is not a static collection of proteins but a dynamic system organized by a protein-protein interaction network, or 'interactome'. It is the wiring of this network that dictates cellular organization, function, and regulation. The key gap in our current knowledge is the lack of a systems-level understanding of how LECA's proteins were interconnected. We have a blueprint of the building blocks but no schematic for how they were assembled into functional machines. Previous research on interactome evolution has been limited, often focusing on the conservation of interactions within small, well-defined pathways or across closely related species. No study has attempted to reconstruct an entire ancestral interactome at the deep evolutionary timescale of LECA. This research is now timely and feasible due to a confluence of factors that align perfectly with the goals of this research call. First, the explosion of publicly available genomic and proteomic data provides the necessary raw material. This includes hundreds of genomes from diverse eukaryotic lineages, particularly from previously under-sampled protists (e.g., from the EukProt and MMETSP projects), which are essential for accurately inferring ancestral states. The availability of Asgard archaeal genomes provides the critical prokaryotic outgroup. Second, large-scale experimental interactome maps from multiple, distantly related model organisms (human, yeast, fly, plant) are now available in public repositories like BioGRID and IntAct. This cross-species data is the foundation for inferring ancestral interactions. Third, computational methods have matured significantly, with powerful tools for orthology inference, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and, most recently, highly accurate protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold2), which can be used to validate predicted interactions. This project will synthesize these disparate data types using a novel integrative approach to fill the critical gap in our understanding of eukaryogenesis. By reconstructing the LECA interactome, we will move from a static gene list to a dynamic network model of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, providing the first mechanistic, systems-level view of how eukaryotic complexity originated.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to reconstruct a high-confidence model of the LECA protein-protein interactome and leverage it to test specific hypotheses about the emergence of eukaryotic cellular complexity. Our research is structured around three central questions.\n\nResearch Question 1: What was the size, topology, and modular organization of the LECA interactome compared to its prokaryotic precursors?\nThis question addresses the global architectural shift in cellular organization during eukaryogenesis. We hypothesize that the transition was accompanied by a quantum leap in the complexity of the cellular interaction network.\n*   Hypothesis 1a: The LECA interactome was significantly larger and more densely connected than any known prokaryotic interactome, reflecting a step-change in cellular complexity. We predict that the reconstructed LECA interactome will contain over 50,000 high-confidence interactions, an order of magnitude greater than typical prokaryotic networks. Furthermore, we predict its network topology (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient) will be quantitatively more similar to modern eukaryotic interactomes than to those of Asgard archaea. This hypothesis will be tested by computing standard network metrics for our reconstructed LECA interactome and performing statistical comparisons against a curated set of interactomes from diverse modern eukaryotes and prokaryotes.\n*   Hypothesis 1b: The LECA interactome was organized into distinct functional modules corresponding to nascent eukaryotic organelles and systems. We predict that applying community detection algorithms to the LECA network will reveal protein clusters significantly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with core eukaryotic functions like 'nuclear transport', 'vesicular trafficking', and 'cytoskeletal organization'. We further predict these modules will be largely absent or rudimentary in prokaryotic networks. This will be tested by applying the Louvain algorithm to the LECA network, performing functional enrichment analysis on the resulting modules, and systematically comparing their composition and connectivity to modules identified in Asgard archaeal networks.\n\nResearch Question 2: Which specific protein interaction networks drove the emergence of key eukaryotic innovations?\nThis question moves from global properties to the specific molecular machines that define eukaryotes.\n*   Hypothesis 2a: The origin of the endomembrane system was driven by the de novo assembly of a novel network of small GTPases (Rabs, Arfs), coat proteins (e.g., clathrin), and tethering complexes. We predict that our LECA interactome will contain a highly interconnected subnetwork of these protein families, which is largely absent in Asgard archaea, although some individual components may have prokaryotic homologs. We will test this by isolating the subnetwork of proteins orthologous to modern trafficking machinery, analyzing its structure, and tracing the emergence of its key interactions along the phylogenetic tree from prokaryotes to LECA.\n*   Hypothesis 2b: The ubiquitin signaling system emerged as a massive expansion of interactions involving E1, E2, and E3 ligases, creating a new layer of regulatory control over pre-existing cellular processes. We predict the LECA interactome will feature a 'hub-and-spoke' topology around ubiquitin and a vast network of E3 ligases and their substrates, dwarfing the rudimentary ubiquitin-like systems in prokaryotes. We will test this by mapping the ubiquitin-related subnetwork in LECA, comparing its size and connectivity to prokaryotic precursor systems, and identifying which cellular processes (e.g., cell cycle control, protein degradation) were the earliest targets of this new regulatory system by analyzing the functions of the inferred ancestral substrates.\n\nResearch Question 3: How did the LECA interactome evolve from its prokaryotic precursors?\nThis question addresses the evolutionary mechanisms that built the new network.\n*   Hypothesis 3a: A significant fraction of LECA interactions originated through the 'rewiring' of pre-existing prokaryotic protein domains into new combinations and contexts. We predict that we will find many instances where two interacting protein families in LECA have prokaryotic orthologs that do not interact. This will be tested by using a domain-centric approach to trace the evolutionary history of interactions, distinguishing between inherited interactions, novel interactions between ancient proteins, and interactions involving newly evolved eukaryotic-specific proteins.\n*   Hypothesis 3b: The endosymbiosis of the proto-mitochondrion involved the large-scale integration of bacterial proteins into the host's interaction network. We predict that proteins of alphaproteobacterial origin in the LECA proteome will show a statistically significant number of interactions with proteins of archaeal (host) origin, particularly in metabolic and signaling pathways. This will be tested by classifying all LECA proteins by their likely phylogenetic origin (archaeal, bacterial, or de novo) and testing for non-random interaction patterns between these classes, thereby mapping the molecular footprint of the endosymbiotic event.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that will exclusively use publicly available data. Our approach is a multi-stage computational pipeline that integrates phylogenomics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and network inference, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group. The project is organized into three primary aims.\n\nAim 1: Assembling a Comprehensive Phylogenetic Dataset and Inferring the LECA Proteome.\nThe foundation of our project is a carefully curated dataset of genomes and proteomes. \n*   Data Sources: We will download complete proteomes from public databases including NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl, and the JGI. Our dataset will comprise three main groups: 1) A taxonomically broad set of ~200 eukaryotic species spanning all major supergroups (e.g., Amorphea, Diaphoretickes), with a special focus on including under-sampled protist lineages from the EukProt and MMETSP databases to break long phylogenetic branches and improve inference accuracy. 2) A comprehensive set of ~50 proteomes from the Asgard archaea superphylum (Loki-, Thor-, Odin-, Heimdallarchaeota), which represent the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. 3) A diverse outgroup of ~50 proteomes from other archaeal and bacterial phyla, including Alphaproteobacteria, to root our analyses and trace the origin of endosymbiont-derived genes.\n*   Orthology Inference and LECA Proteome Reconstruction: We will use OrthoFinder to define protein families (orthogroups) across our entire species set. OrthoFinder's graph-based approach is robust to varying evolutionary distances. A protein family will be inferred as present in LECA if it is found in representatives of at least two major eukaryotic supergroups. We will refine this inference using a likelihood-based phylogenetic presence/absence method (e.g., GLOOME) to assign a probability score for each family's presence in LECA. This process will yield a high-confidence LECA proteome, which forms the set of nodes for our ancestral network.\n\nAim 2: Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) for LECA Proteins.\nTo enable structural and co-evolutionary analyses, we must infer the primary sequences of LECA proteins.\n*   Phylogenetic Pipeline: For each protein family inferred to be in LECA, we will generate a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT and construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE, which automatically selects the best-fit model of sequence evolution. The trees will be manually inspected for quality.\n*   Ancestral Sequence Inference: Using the gene family tree and alignment, we will perform ASR using an empirical Bayesian or maximum likelihood method (e.g., as implemented in PAML or PhyloBot). This will generate the most probable amino acid sequence for the LECA version of each protein. We will also calculate posterior probabilities for each reconstructed amino acid site to quantify uncertainty, which can be propagated into downstream analyses.\n\nAim 3: Reconstructing and Analyzing the LECA Interactome.\nThis aim constitutes the core of the project, where we infer the connections (edges) between the LECA proteins (nodes).\n*   Interaction Data Aggregation: We will compile a meta-database of experimentally determined, physical protein-protein interactions from major public repositories, including BioGRID, IntAct, DIP, and MINT. We will filter for high-quality evidence (e.g., yeast-two-hybrid, affinity purification-mass spectrometry) from multiple, distantly related model eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, A. thaliana) to build a robust reference set.\n*   Ancestral Interaction Inference: We will use a powerful, multi-evidence approach. An interaction between two LECA proteins will be considered high-confidence if supported by at least two of the following independent methods:\n    1.  Phylogenetic Profiling of Interactions (Interolog Mapping): This is our primary discovery method. If orthologs of protein A and protein B are known to interact in multiple, divergent modern species, we can parsimoniously infer that the ancestral proteins A' and B' also interacted in LECA. We will use a probabilistic framework that maps known interactions onto the species tree to infer the likelihood of the interaction's presence at the LECA node.\n    2.  Co-evolutionary Analysis: For each pair of LECA protein families, we will construct a paired multiple sequence alignment. We will then use methods like DCA (Direct Coupling Analysis) or GREMLIN to detect co-evolving residue pairs. A strong co-evolutionary signal between two protein families is powerful, independent evidence of a direct physical interaction.\n    3.  Structural Modeling Validation: For key predicted interactions, particularly those in novel eukaryotic complexes, we will use the reconstructed ancestral sequences as input for AlphaFold-Multimer. A high-confidence predicted structure (high pLDDT and PAE scores) with a well-defined, low-energy interface will provide strong physical evidence for the plausibility of the interaction. This computationally intensive step will be used to validate hundreds of the most critical or novel predicted interactions.\n*   Network Analysis and Hypothesis Testing: The final LECA interactome will be assembled from all high-confidence interactions. We will use network analysis tools (e.g., Cytoscape, NetworkX) to analyze its global topology, detect functional modules, and isolate subnetworks corresponding to our specific hypotheses. Statistical comparisons with modern prokaryotic and eukaryotic networks will be performed to test our predictions about the growth of complexity.\n\nTimeline:\n*   Year 1: Data aggregation, establishment of the phylogenomic pipeline, and generation of the LECA proteome. First working group meeting.\n*   Year 2: Completion of ASR for all LECA proteins. Implementation and benchmarking of the three interaction inference methods. Generation of a draft LECA interactome. Trainee workshop.\n*   Year 3: Refinement and validation of the interactome. In-depth network analysis to test hypotheses 1-3. Comparative analysis with prokaryotic networks. Second working group meeting.\n*   Year 4: Analysis of key subnetworks, manuscript preparation, and development of the public web portal for data dissemination. Final working group meeting.",

The Reconstructed LECA Interactome: The primary deliverable will be a high-confidence, computationally reconstructed protein-protein interaction network for the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. This network, comprising thousands of proteins and tens of thousands of interactions, will be the first systems-level functional model of this pivotal ancestral organism. It will be made publicly available as a foundational resource for the scientific community.\n2.  A Catalog of Eukaryotic Molecular Innovations: By comparing the LECA interactome to prokaryotic networks, we will identify the specific interaction modules and wiring changes that underpinned key eukaryotic innovations. This will provide a mechanistic roadmap of eukaryogenesis, pinpointing the assembly of novel complexes like the nuclear pore and the expansion of regulatory networks like the ubiquitin system.\n3.  A Validated Methodological Pipeline: We will develop and disseminate a novel, robust computational pipeline for reconstructing deep ancestral interactomes. This integrative framework, combining phylogenetics, co-evolution, and structural modeling, will be a valuable tool applicable to studying other major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of multicellularity or phototrophy.\n\nIntellectual Impact:\nThis research will fundamentally shift our understanding of eukaryogenesis from a gene-centric view to a network-centric one. It will provide concrete, testable hypotheses about the function and organization of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, transforming a subject of speculation into one of computational and quantitative inquiry. By revealing how molecular complexity is built through the evolution of interaction networks, our work will provide general principles of systems evolution. It will allow researchers to ask new questions, such as which cellular processes were the first to be regulated by phosphorylation or ubiquitination, or how the metabolic network of the host and endosymbiont were integrated at the protein level. This resource will fuel hypothesis-driven experimental work for years, for instance, by guiding synthetic biologists attempting to engineer eukaryotic-like features in prokaryotic chassis.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n*   Training and Workforce Development: This project is an ideal training ground for the next generation of data-savvy biologists.

We will host an annual virtual workshop on data synthesis methods, open to the broader community, to amplify our training impact.\n*   Fostering Collaboration and Open Science: This working group unites researchers from evolutionary biology, cell biology, and computational science, creating a transdisciplinary environment that is essential for success. We are fully committed to open science principles. All analysis scripts will be shared on GitHub, all data will be deposited in public repositories, and the final interactome will be accessible through a user-friendly web portal. This ensures our work is transparent, reproducible, and maximally beneficial to the scientific community.\n*   Dissemination and Public Engagement: We will disseminate our findings through high-impact, open-access publications and presentations at major international conferences (e.g., SMBE, ASCB). We will also develop educational materials, including interactive visualizations of the ancestral cell's network, for use in undergraduate courses and public outreach, making this fundamental story of our own cellular origins accessible to a wider audience.\n\nLong-Term Vision:\nThe LECA interactome is not an endpoint but a starting point. It will serve as a scaffold for future studies, such as integrating metabolic network data, transcriptomic data, or protein-DNA interactions to build an even more comprehensive multi-scale model of the ancestral cell. This project will build a collaborative community and a methodological foundation that will sustain research into deep evolutionary transitions long after the funding period ends.",

Using this integrated dataset, we will employ genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs) and machine learning to: 1) Construct context-specific metabolic models for every major cancer subtype; 2) Identify a core set of metabolic reactions and pathways that are consistently dysregulated across most cancers, representing robust therapeutic targets; 3) Uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities that are linked to specific driver mutations or tissue-of-origin effects; and 4) Correlate metabolic phenotypes with clinical outcomes and drug response data. This community-scale synthesis will generate a powerful resource for the field, providing a systems-level view of cancer metabolism that can guide the development of next-generation metabolic therapies.",
        "background_and_significance": "The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a foundational hallmark of cancer, enabling the rapid proliferation and survival of tumor cells in diverse microenvironments. First observed by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, this phenomenon, characterized by elevated glucose uptake and lactate fermentation even in the presence of oxygen, is now understood to be part of a much broader metabolic rewiring that affects pathways involving amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides. This metabolic plasticity provides cancer cells with the necessary building blocks for biomass, the energy currency (ATP), and the redox potential (NADPH) required to sustain uncontrolled growth and combat oxidative stress. Consequently, the enzymes and transporters that orchestrate this reprogramming represent a promising, yet largely untapped, class of therapeutic targets. Despite decades of research, our ability to therapeutically exploit cancer metabolism has been hampered by the profound metabolic heterogeneity observed across and within tumor types. While some metabolic dependencies, such as the reliance on glycolysis, appear widespread, others are highly context-specific, dictated by the tumor's tissue of origin, its unique repertoire of driver mutations (e.g., IDH1, KRAS, MYC), and the specific nutrient conditions of the tumor microenvironment. This complexity raises a critical question for the field: which metabolic vulnerabilities are conserved across most cancers, representing potential broad-spectrum targets, and which are unique to specific cancer subtypes, offering opportunities for precision medicine? Answering this question requires a systems-level, pan-cancer approach that has, until now, been infeasible. Previous studies have provided valuable but fragmented insights. Landmark pan-cancer analyses, primarily from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, have successfully mapped the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of cancer, but they often lack the integrated proteomic and metabolomic data necessary to directly infer metabolic function. Studies focused on specific cancer types have successfully linked genetic drivers to metabolic phenotypes, such as the role of VHL loss in clear cell renal carcinoma or IDH1/2 mutations in glioma, but these findings are not easily generalizable. More recent efforts have begun to apply computational modeling, such as genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), to predict metabolic states from transcriptomic data. However, these studies have typically been limited to a single cancer type, a single data modality (transcriptomics), or have used inconsistent data processing methods, preventing robust cross-cancer comparisons. A significant gap in current knowledge is the absence of a unified, multi-modal framework to systematically map the metabolic landscape across the full spectrum of human cancers. We lack a comprehensive resource that integrates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics from a large cohort of tumors to build predictive models of metabolic function. This project is both important and timely because it directly addresses this gap by leveraging an unprecedented opportunity. The recent maturation and public release of massive, complementary datasets from consortia like TCGA, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) make such a synthesis possible for the first time. Concurrently, advances in computational systems biology, including sophisticated algorithms for building context-specific GEMs and powerful machine learning techniques, provide the analytical tools required to extract meaningful biological insights from these complex, high-dimensional datasets. By creating a Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas, this project will move beyond single-gene, single-pathway analyses to provide a holistic view of cancer metabolism, distinguishing universal principles from context-dependent rules and generating a wealth of testable hypotheses to guide the next generation of metabolic cancer therapies.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is designed to systematically dissect the complexity of cancer metabolism through a large-scale data synthesis approach. Our research is structured around four central aims, each addressing a critical question and driven by a testable hypothesis. The overarching goal is to create a durable resource that transforms our understanding of metabolic reprogramming in cancer and provides a rational basis for therapeutic development.\n\n**Aim 1: To construct a comprehensive, integrated Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas and a corresponding suite of context-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).**\n*   **Research Question:** Can disparate public multi-omics datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) be harmonized into a unified computational resource capable of accurately modeling the metabolic state of distinct cancer subtypes?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a standardized bioinformatics pipeline can process and integrate data from TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC for over 20,000 tumors, and that this integrated data can be used with established algorithms (e.g., tINIT) to construct high-fidelity, context-specific GEMs for each of the 33 major cancer types represented in TCGA.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** The primary deliverable will be the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas, a publicly accessible resource containing harmonized multi-omics data and over 30 cancer-specific GEMs. These models will serve as in silico platforms for simulating metabolic functions.\n*   **Validation:** The predictive accuracy of our constructed GEMs will be rigorously validated. We will compare model predictions of gene essentiality for cell growth against experimental data from large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens available in the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). A high correlation between our in silico predictions and in vitro experimental results will validate the biological relevance of our models.\n\n**Aim 2: To identify a core set of conserved metabolic reactions and pathways that represent pan-cancer vulnerabilities.**\n*   **Research Question:** Are there specific metabolic enzymes or pathways that are consistently essential for proliferation across a majority of human cancers, regardless of their genetic background or tissue of origin?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a systematic in silico comparison of reaction essentiality across all our cancer-specific GEMs will reveal a 'core cancer metabolome'—a set of metabolic reactions whose inhibition is predicted to be lethal to most cancer types. We predict this core set will be enriched for specific pathways, such as nucleotide synthesis and redox balance.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** A ranked and annotated list of high-confidence, conserved metabolic targets. This list will provide a data-driven foundation for developing broad-spectrum metabolic therapies.\n*   **Validation:** The predicted pan-cancer essential genes corresponding to our core reactions will be cross-referenced with DepMap data. We expect our top candidates to show strong negative median dependency scores across hundreds of cancer cell lines, providing independent experimental validation of their widespread importance.\n\n**Aim 3: To uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities dictated by genetic drivers and tissue of origin.**\n*   **Research Question:** How do specific oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, PIK3CA, IDH1) and cellular context (e.g., liver vs. brain) create unique, targetable metabolic dependencies?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that machine learning models, trained on the multi-omics features of our Atlas, can accurately predict tumor-specific metabolic dependencies. For instance, we predict that models will learn to associate KRAS mutations with an increased reliance on non-canonical glutamine metabolism and VHL mutations with dependencies on pathways regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** A predictive map linking genomic and transcriptomic features to specific metabolic liabilities. This will generate novel, testable hypotheses for precision oncology strategies.\n*   **Validation:** We will validate our model's predictions against established, literature-curated examples of context-specific metabolic dependencies. Furthermore, we will perform case studies on specific cancer subtypes, comparing our model's predictions with published experimental data for those subtypes.\n\n**Aim 4: To identify novel metabolic signatures ('metabotypes') that correlate with clinical outcomes and therapeutic response.**\n*   **Research Question:** Can the comprehensive metabolic flux profiles predicted by our models be used to stratify patients into subgroups with distinct clinical prognoses or sensitivities to treatment?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that unsupervised clustering of the predicted metabolic flux maps from thousands of individual tumors will reveal novel patient subgroups, or 'metabotypes,' that are not discernible from genomic data alone. We further hypothesize that these metabotypes will be significantly associated with clinical variables such as overall survival, disease-free survival, and, where data is available, response to chemotherapy or targeted agents.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** A set of validated metabolic biomarkers for patient prognosis and treatment stratification. This could inform the design of future clinical trials for metabolic drugs.\n*   **Validation:** The prognostic significance of our identified metabotypes will be tested using standard survival analysis techniques (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models) on the clinical data associated with the tumor samples. We will use a train-test split methodology to ensure the robustness of our findings and avoid overfitting.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will execute a systematic, multi-stage research plan that is entirely computational and leverages only publicly available data, perfectly aligning with the research call's focus on data synthesis. Our approach integrates state-of-the-art bioinformatics, systems biology modeling, and machine learning.\n\n**Data Acquisition and Harmonization**\nOur primary data sources will be three major cancer research consortia: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). We will systematically download and curate the following data types for over 20,000 tumor samples and their available matched-normal controls across more than 30 distinct cancer types:\n*   **Genomics:** Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) from whole-exome sequencing (WES) in MAF format, and somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) from array-based platforms.\n*   **Transcriptomics:** Gene expression levels (RNA-Seq) as raw counts and normalized TPM/FPKM values.\n*   **Proteomics:** Protein abundance data from mass spectrometry-based platforms, primarily available through CPTAC for a subset of TCGA cohorts.\n*   **Metabolomics:** Relative metabolite abundance data, where available from specific TCGA/CPTAC studies.\n*   **Clinical Data:** Patient demographics, tumor stage, grade, survival data (overall and progression-free), and treatment history.\n\nA robust and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline will be developed using Snakemake or Nextflow workflow management systems. This pipeline will perform all harmonization steps: aligning data to the GRCh38 human reference genome, standardizing gene identifiers, applying consistent normalization methods (e.g., TMM for RNA-Seq counts), and using algorithms like ComBat-seq to mitigate batch effects arising from different sequencing centers or platforms. The final output will be a unified, analysis-ready data matrix, forming the core of our Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas.\n\n**Aim 1: Construction of Context-Specific Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs)**\nWe will use the COBRA (Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis) framework, a widely accepted standard in systems biology. Starting with the most comprehensive human metabolic reconstruction, Recon3D, as a template, we will generate context-specific models for each of the 33 TCGA cancer types. The tINIT (Task-driven Integrative Network Inference for Tissues) algorithm will be employed for this task. tINIT is particularly well-suited as it integrates transcriptomic and proteomic data to prune the generic network, retaining only those reactions supported by expression evidence in a given cancer type. It also ensures the resulting models can perform essential metabolic functions (tasks) known to occur in human cells, such as ATP production and synthesis of all biomass components. This process will yield a collection of high-quality, curated GEMs, each representing the active metabolic network of a specific cancer.\n\n**Aim 2 & 3: Identification of Metabolic Vulnerabilities**\nTo identify vulnerabilities, we will perform in silico gene deletion simulations on each cancer-specific GEM. Using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we will predict the optimal distribution of metabolic fluxes that maximizes a defined biological objective, typically the production of biomass, which serves as a proxy for cell proliferation. We will then systematically simulate the knockout of each metabolic gene in the model by constraining the flux through the corresponding reaction(s) to zero. The effect on the maximal biomass production rate will be calculated. Genes whose knockout leads to a significant reduction in biomass production will be classified as essential for that cancer type.\n*   **For Aim 2 (Conserved Vulnerabilities):** We will perform a meta-analysis across all cancer models. A gene/reaction will be defined as a 'core' vulnerability if it is predicted to be essential in a high percentage (>80%) of the cancer types analyzed. Statistical enrichment analyses will be used to identify pathways that are consistently essential across cancers.\n*   **For Aim 3 (Specific Vulnerabilities):** We will build a machine learning framework to link genomic features to metabolic dependencies. For each gene, we will create a vector of its predicted essentiality scores across all tumor samples. We will then train supervised machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict these essentiality scores using somatic mutations, CNAs, and gene expression levels as input features. Model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP values) will be used to identify the specific genomic alterations that are most predictive of a dependency on a given metabolic pathway.\n\n**Aim 4: Correlation with Clinical Outcomes**\nFor each individual tumor sample with sufficient data, we will generate a personalized metabolic flux map using its transcriptomic profile to constrain the relevant cancer-type GEM. This will result in a high-dimensional vector of predicted reaction fluxes for each tumor. We will apply unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization, UMAP followed by k-means) to this flux matrix to identify recurrent metabolic states, or 'metabotypes,' across the pan-cancer cohort. We will then use Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test to determine if these metabotypes are associated with significant differences in patient survival. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to assess the independent prognostic value of these metabotypes while controlling for known clinical covariates like tumor stage and patient age.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones**\n*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Finalize working group composition. Develop and validate the data harmonization pipeline. Acquire and process all data from TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC. Construct and validate the first set of 10 cancer-specific GEMs. Hold kickoff working group meeting.\n*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Complete construction of all 33 cancer-specific GEMs. Perform pan-cancer analysis to identify core metabolic vulnerabilities (Aim 2). Develop, train, and validate machine learning models for predicting context-specific dependencies (Aim 3). Release the integrated data atlas and models publicly. Hold mid-project meeting and trainee workshop.\n*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36):** Conduct clinical correlation analyses to identify prognostic metabotypes (Aim 4). Synthesize all findings, prepare manuscripts for publication, and develop the user-friendly web portal for data dissemination. Hold final working group meeting to plan future collaborations.",

Our findings will be published in open-access journals.\n*   **Advancing Therapeutic Development:** The ultimate impact of this research lies in its potential to accelerate the development of new cancer therapies. By providing a rich, pre-clinical platform for target discovery and hypothesis generation, our work will de-risk and guide the efforts of academic and pharmaceutical researchers, potentially shortening the timeline for bringing novel metabolic drugs to the clinic.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision**\nOur dissemination strategy is multi-faceted. We will publish our findings in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals and present at key international conferences (e.g., AACR Annual Meeting, Gordon Research Conference on Cancer Metabolism). The cornerstone of our dissemination effort will be the creation of an interactive web portal. This portal will allow users to visualize data from the Atlas, query the predicted vulnerabilities of specific genes in different cancers, and download the metabolic models. We will also host a virtual workshop to train the broader research community on how to use these resources. The long-term vision is for the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas to become a living resource, periodically updated with new public datasets, and to serve as a foundational component of a future 'Cancer Cell Map' initiative. The collaborations forged in this working group will form the basis for future grant applications aimed at experimentally validating our top computational predictions.",

        "background_and_significance": "The relationship between viruses and their hosts is a defining example of antagonistic co-evolution, a relentless molecular arms race that has shaped cellular biology and driven organismal diversity for billions of years. Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, must commandeer the host cellular machinery for their replication, while hosts have evolved elaborate multi-layered defense systems to detect and eliminate them. This dynamic conflict has left indelible signatures in the genomes of both entities. Understanding the fundamental principles governing these interactions is not merely an academic exercise; it is a critical necessity for global health, as underscored by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the persistent threat of emerging viral pathogens. The ability to predict viral mechanisms, identify host vulnerabilities, and develop broad-spectrum therapeutics hinges on a deep, generalizable knowledge of the host-virus battlefield. \n\nOver the past two decades, high-throughput technologies have generated a wealth of data detailing the molecular intricacies of these conflicts. Large-scale screens using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) have mapped the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for numerous individual viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2. These studies, exemplified by the work of Gordon et al. (2020) on the SARS-CoV-2 interactome, have been instrumental in identifying host factors required for viral replication and potential targets for drug repurposing. Concurrently, the proliferation of next-generation sequencing has led to an explosion of transcriptomic data, deposited in public repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). These datasets provide a dynamic view of the host cellular response to infection, revealing the large-scale transcriptional reprogramming that viruses induce. Complementing this, structural biology has resolved the atomic details of many key host-virus protein complexes, offering mechanistic insights into how viral proteins subvert host functions.\n\nDespite this progress, our understanding remains fragmented and largely virus-centric. Current knowledge is siloed within studies of single viruses or viral families, preventing the identification of deeply conserved, universal principles. Public databases that collate this information, such as BioGRID and VirusMentha, are invaluable resources but do not provide an integrated, cross-species synthesis. A major gap in the field is the lack of a unified framework that integrates interactomic, transcriptomic, and evolutionary data across a wide phylogenetic range of viruses and hosts. We do not yet have a systematic answer to fundamental questions: Are there universal 'choke points' in the host cell that are targeted by most viruses? Have diverse viruses convergently evolved similar molecular tools to disable these defenses? Can we use evolutionary signatures to pinpoint the most critical battlegrounds at the molecular level? Current approaches, typically confined to individual labs, lack the scale and multidisciplinary expertise required to tackle these questions. This project is timely because we have reached a critical mass of public data and a maturation of computational tools in network biology and comparative genomics. By synthesizing this disparate data, we can move beyond isolated case studies to uncover the general 'rules of engagement' in host-virus conflicts. This research will transform our understanding of innate immunity and viral pathogenesis, creating a powerful predictive framework to combat not only existing viruses but also the emergent threats of the future.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is designed to systematically uncover the conserved principles of host-virus molecular conflicts through a large-scale synthesis of public data. Our central goal is to build and analyze a unified, cross-species interactome to identify the universal choke points in host defense and the convergent strategies viruses use to overcome them. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research aims, each guided by testable hypotheses.\n\n**Aim 1: Identify Conserved Host Defense Hubs.** This aim seeks to define the core set of host proteins that represent the central battlegrounds in the host-virus arms race.\n*   **Research Question:** Are there specific host proteins or pathways that are consistently and preferentially targeted by a wide range of evolutionarily diverse viruses across different host species?\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** A discrete subset of host proteins, which we term 'host defense hubs,' function as central nodes in intrinsic and innate immunity and are therefore convergently targeted by numerous, unrelated viruses. We predict these hubs will exhibit a significantly higher number of viral protein interactors (network degree) in our integrated interactome compared to other host proteins. Furthermore, we predict these proteins will be significantly enriched for functions related to antiviral signaling (e.g., interferon pathways), protein degradation (e.g., ubiquitination), and translation regulation.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** The functional importance of these hubs is reflected in their transcriptional response during infection. We hypothesize that the genes encoding these hubs will be consistently and significantly dysregulated across a broad array of viral infections. We predict that a meta-analysis of public transcriptomic data will reveal a 'core viral response signature' of differentially expressed genes that significantly overlaps with the interaction hubs identified in Hypothesis 1a.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will test these hypotheses by constructing a comprehensive host-virus PPI network and applying network-theoretic statistics to identify high-degree nodes. We will perform functional enrichment analysis on these nodes. Concurrently, we will conduct a large-scale meta-analysis of infection transcriptomes from GEO. The statistical significance of the overlap between the two sets of identified genes will be rigorously assessed using permutation tests.\n\n**Aim 2: Uncover Conserved Viral Evasion Strategies.** This aim focuses on the viral side of the conflict, investigating whether different viruses have evolved similar molecular solutions to the common problem of subverting host hubs.\n*   **Research Question:** Do phylogenetically distinct viruses evolve similar molecular strategies, such as structural mimicry or motif mimicry, to antagonize the same host defense hubs?\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Viruses from different families have convergently evolved proteins with similar three-dimensional structures or short linear motifs (SLiMs) that bind to the same functional interface on a given host defense hub. We predict that structural clustering of all viral proteins targeting a specific hub will reveal groups of non-homologous proteins with shared structural folds. Similarly, we predict that motif discovery algorithms will identify conserved SLiMs that mimic host motifs (e.g., SUMO-interacting motifs, degrons) used to hijack cellular machinery.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** For each identified host hub, we will perform all-by-all structural comparisons of its viral interactors using tools like DALI. We will search for conserved motifs using the MEME suite and compare them to the ELM database. The significance of these findings will be assessed against null models of random protein sets.\n\n**Aim 3: Pinpoint High-Conflict Interfaces through Evolutionary Analysis.** This aim will use signatures of natural selection to identify the precise molecular interfaces under the strongest co-evolutionary pressure.\n*   **Research Question:** Can we identify the specific amino acid residues at the host-virus interface that are the focus of the molecular arms race?\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** Host defense hubs and their viral antagonists are engaged in an ongoing evolutionary conflict, which leaves a detectable signature of rapid evolution (positive selection). We predict that orthologs of host hub proteins across mammals will exhibit significantly elevated dN/dS ratios (non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates) compared to genome-wide averages. The viral proteins targeting these hubs will show similar signatures of rapid evolution across related viral strains or species.\n*   **Hypothesis 3b:** The specific residues under positive selection are not randomly distributed but are concentrated at the physical interface of the host-virus protein complex. We predict that when these rapidly evolving sites are mapped onto 3D structures, they will cluster significantly at the protein-protein interaction surface, pinpointing the high-conflict zones.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will use codon-based models of evolution (e.g., PAML, HyPhy) to identify sites under positive selection in both host and viral gene alignments. We will then use structural data from the PDB and AlphaFold DB to map these sites and test for their spatial clustering at the interface using statistical tests, validating our predictions against known functional data from mutagenesis studies in the literature.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed through a phased, computationally-driven approach that integrates diverse public datasets into a unified analytical framework. Our methodology is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and transparent, adhering to open science principles. The project is structured into three main phases: 1) Data Acquisition and Integration, 2) Multi-modal Network Analysis, and 3) Dissemination.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Integration (Year 1)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on building a comprehensive, multi-layered database. We will develop a robust, automated pipeline using Snakemake to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future updates.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically aggregate data from multiple public repositories. \n    *   **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Data:** We will query major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, MINT, and VirusMentha to collect all available host-virus and host-host PPIs. Data will be filtered to retain only interactions supported by direct experimental evidence, and a confidence score will be assigned based on the detection method and number of publications.\n    *   **Transcriptomic Data:** We will perform a systematic search of NCBI GEO and ArrayExpress to identify all RNA-seq and microarray datasets related to viral infection of mammalian and avian cells/tissues. We will curate associated metadata (host, virus, cell type, time point, etc.) into a standardized format.\n    *   **Structural Data:** We will download all experimentally determined structures of host-virus protein complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For proteins lacking experimental structures, we will retrieve high-quality predicted models from the AlphaFold Database.\n    *   **Genomic and Proteomic Sequence Data:** We will source canonical protein and coding sequences from UniProt and Ensembl. Orthology relationships across host species will be obtained from Ensembl Compara and OrthoDB.\n*   **Data Harmonization and Integration:** A critical challenge is data heterogeneity. Our pipeline will map all gene and protein identifiers to a common namespace (Ensembl and UniProtKB). Raw RNA-seq data (FASTQ files) will be processed through a standardized pipeline (FASTQC, Trimmomatic, STAR alignment, featureCounts) to generate comparable expression matrices. All integrated data—PPIs, gene expression profiles, structural information, and evolutionary relationships—will be loaded into a Neo4j graph database. This structure allows for efficient and complex queries across different data types, for example, 'Find all host proteins that interact with at least three viral families and are consistently upregulated during infection.'\n\n**Phase 2: Analytical Approach (Years 2-3)**\nWith the integrated database in place, we will execute our three research aims.\n*   **Aim 1 (Hub Identification):** We will construct a host-virus interaction network and use the NetworkX Python library to calculate centrality metrics (degree, betweenness) for all host proteins. 'Host defense hubs' will be defined as proteins in the top 5% of degree centrality that are targeted by viruses from at least three distinct families. We will perform functional enrichment analysis on this set of hubs using g:Profiler against GO, KEGG, and Reactome databases. For the transcriptomic analysis, we will use the R package 'metafor' to perform a random-effects meta-analysis on the processed expression data, identifying genes with a consistent and significant change in expression across diverse infections. The statistical significance of the overlap between network hubs and the core transcriptional response will be evaluated using a hypergeometric test.\n*   **Aim 2 (Strategy Identification):** For each major host hub, we will collect its viral interactors. We will use TM-align to perform all-vs-all structural alignments and hierarchical clustering to identify groups of viral proteins with convergent structural folds. In parallel, we will use the MEME algorithm to search for conserved short linear motifs (SLiMs) in the sequences of these viral interactors. Discovered motifs will be scanned against the ELM database to identify potential instances of host mimicry. \n*   **Aim 3 (Evolutionary Analysis):** For each host hub, we will create codon alignments of its orthologs from ~50 mammalian species. We will use the CodeML program in the PAML package (and the BUSTED method in HyPhy for robustness) to fit models of codon evolution and identify genes under positive selection. The Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood (REL) method will be used to identify specific codons (sites) under episodic positive selection. For viral protein families, a similar approach will be applied. We will then develop a Python script to map these identified sites onto corresponding PDB or AlphaFold structures. A permutation-based statistical test will be implemented to determine if these sites are significantly closer to the host-virus interaction interface than expected by chance.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Months 1-12:** Complete data acquisition pipeline development and populate the Neo4j database. **Milestone:** Public release of the integrated Host-Virus Interaction Database (HVIDB).\n*   **Months 13-18:** Complete Aim 1 analysis. **Milestone:** Manuscript draft identifying and characterizing conserved host defense hubs.\n*   **Months 19-24:** Complete Aim 2 analysis. **Milestone:** Manuscript draft detailing convergent viral evasion strategies.\n*   **Months 25-30:** Complete Aim 3 analysis. **Milestone:** Manuscript draft on the co-evolutionary dynamics at host-virus interfaces.\n*   **Months 31-36:** Synthesize all findings, finalize publications, and host a dissemination workshop. **Milestone:** Final project report and public release of all analysis workflows and code.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will generate significant outcomes that will advance the fields of virology, immunology, and evolutionary medicine, with tangible broader impacts on public health and scientific training. Our work is designed not only to answer fundamental scientific questions but also to create lasting resources and a collaborative framework for the research community.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Unified Community Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the Host-Virus Interaction Database (HVIDB), the first resource of its kind to integrate interactomic, transcriptomic, structural, and evolutionary data across a broad range of viruses and hosts. By making this database and its query interface publicly available, we will provide an invaluable tool for hypothesis generation and data exploration for the entire research community, lowering the barrier to entry for complex synthesis research.\n2.  **Discovery of Fundamental Principles:** Our analysis will move beyond the specifics of individual viruses to reveal the general 'rules of engagement' in host-virus conflicts. The identification of a core set of 'host defense hubs' will provide a functional roadmap of the most critical cellular nodes for antiviral defense. This will fundamentally reshape our understanding of innate immunity, highlighting which pathways are under the greatest evolutionary pressure from viral pathogens.\n3.  **A Novel Methodological Framework:** We will establish and validate a powerful, multi-modal analytical framework for studying host-pathogen co-evolution. This integrative approach, combining network biology, comparative genomics, and structural bioinformatics, will serve as a template for future synthesis projects, applicable not only to viruses but also to other pathogens like bacteria and parasites.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n1.  **Informing Therapeutic Development:** A key challenge in antiviral therapy is the rapid evolution of viruses, leading to drug resistance. Our project will identify conserved host defense hubs that are essential for the replication of many different viruses. These host proteins represent prime targets for host-directed therapies. Such therapies, by targeting less mutable host factors, are expected to be more broad-spectrum and less prone to viral escape, offering a powerful strategy against both existing and emerging viruses.\n2.  **Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness:** The principles uncovered by this research will create a predictive framework for understanding novel pathogens. When a new virus emerges, its proteome can be rapidly analyzed for structural or sequence features (e.g., motifs identified in Aim 2) that suggest an interaction with our identified host hubs. This will allow for the rapid generation of testable hypotheses about its pathogenic mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities, accelerating the research response during a public health crisis.\n3.  **Training the Next Generation of Data-Savvy Biologists:** This project is inherently multidisciplinary and collaborative, providing an ideal training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in computational biology, big data management (SQL/graph databases), bioinformatics pipeline development, network analysis, and evolutionary genetics. This cross-training is essential for the future biomedical workforce and directly aligns with the funding call's goal of developing data-savvy researchers.\n\n**Dissemination and Open Science:**\nWe are fully committed to the principles of open and reproducible science. All analysis scripts, computational workflows, and pipelines will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub, accompanied by detailed documentation and Jupyter Notebooks. The HVIDB will be released publicly in Year 1 and updated throughout the project. We plan to publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals, with at least three major publications anticipated from our three research aims. Findings will be presented at key international conferences, such as the American Society for Virology (ASV) and the International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB). In the final year, we will host a virtual workshop to train the broader community on how to use our database and analytical tools, ensuring the long-term impact and utility of our work.",

        "background_and_significance": "The inheritance of acquired characteristics, a concept long associated with Lamarck, has been re-examined through the modern lens of epigenetics. While genetic inheritance via DNA sequence is the cornerstone of heredity, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI) proposes a parallel system where environmental information is encoded in molecular marks on top of the DNA and transmitted to subsequent, unexposed generations. This phenomenon challenges the Weismann barrier, which posits a strict separation between the somatic and germline cells, and has profound implications for evolutionary biology, agriculture, and human health. The field has gained significant traction over the past two decades, with compelling evidence emerging from diverse model organisms. In mammals, studies have shown that parental diet, stress, or toxicant exposure can influence offspring metabolism, behavior, and disease susceptibility for multiple generations. For instance, Skinner et al. demonstrated that F0 exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin induced reproductive defects in male rats that persisted to the F3 generation, correlated with altered DNA methylation in sperm. In invertebrates, the mechanisms appear distinct but equally potent. Work in *C. elegans* by Rechavi and others has provided strong evidence for small RNAs as carriers of heritable information, capable of transmitting learned behaviors like viral avoidance for several generations. Similarly, studies in *Drosophila* have shown that parental diet can induce chromatin state changes that are inherited by offspring, affecting their metabolic health. In plants, phenomena like vernalization, where cold exposure induces flowering competence, are mediated by heritable changes in histone modifications, specifically H3K27me3 at the FLC locus. Despite these compelling examples, the field of TGEI remains highly controversial and fragmented. A primary limitation is the lack of reproducibility and generalizability. Findings are often specific to a particular model organism, environmental stimulus, sex, and epigenetic mechanism studied. For every positive report, there are studies that fail to replicate the effect, leading to skepticism about the prevalence and significance of TGEI. A major biological hurdle is the extensive epigenetic reprogramming that occurs in the primordial germ cells and the early embryo, which is thought to erase the vast majority of epigenetic marks to ensure totipotency. For TGEI to occur, specific information must somehow escape or be re-established after these reprogramming waves. The molecular mechanisms governing this escape remain one of the central puzzles in the field. The current state of knowledge is a mosaic of intriguing but disconnected findings. We lack a systematic understanding of whether common principles govern TGEI across the tree of life. Are there specific 'carrier' molecules, such as small RNAs, that are universally employed? Are certain genes or genomic regions, like transposable elements, particularly susceptible to heritable epigenetic modification? Do different environmental stimuli converge on common molecular pathways in the germline? Answering these questions is impossible from single-lab studies alone. This research is critically important and timely because we are at an inflection point. The proliferation of public 'omics' data archives (e.g., GEO, SRA) now provides an unprecedented opportunity to address these questions through large-scale data synthesis. For the first time, it is feasible to collate, re-analyze, and integrate dozens of TGEI studies under a single, harmonized analytical framework. Such a community-scale effort, as proposed here, can transcend the limitations of individual studies to identify robust, conserved patterns. By synthesizing the existing evidence, this project will bring much-needed clarity to a contentious field, resolve long-standing debates, and establish a rigorous foundation for a new generation of mechanistic, hypothesis-driven experimental research into how the environment's echo is heard across generations.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research project is designed to move the field of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI) from a collection of case studies to a synthetic, principles-based science. Our overarching goal is to determine if conserved molecular signatures and pathways mediate the transmission of environmentally induced epigenetic states across generations. To achieve this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research questions, each with testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes.\n\n**Research Question 1: Are there conserved epigenetic signatures at the chromatin level (DNA methylation and histone modifications) associated with TGEI across diverse species and environmental stimuli?**\nThe stability of chromatin states through meiosis and fertilization is a key requirement for TGEI. While global reprogramming erases most marks, some loci may escape this process. We will investigate if these 'escapee' loci share common features across species.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** TGEI is mediated by the incomplete erasure of repressive histone marks (e.g., H3K9me3, H3K27me3) at specific orthologous genes or transposable elements (TEs) in the germline. We predict that a meta-analysis of ChIP-seq datasets from F2/F3 descendants will reveal a statistically significant enrichment of these marks at a conserved set of genes, particularly those involved in developmental plasticity, stress response, and metabolism. We further predict that TEs, known targets of epigenetic silencing, will be hotspots for heritable changes.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** Heritable changes in DNA methylation are not randomly distributed but are targeted to specific genomic contexts that are predisposed to resist reprogramming, such as CpG islands in gene promoters, enhancer regions, or imprinted control regions. We predict that a cross-species comparison of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data will identify conserved differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in F2/F3 descendants. These conserved DMRs will be significantly associated with orthologous genes whose expression is known to be altered in TGEI paradigms and will correlate with the observed heritable phenotypes.\n\n**Research Question 2: Do small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) represent a conserved vector for transmitting environmental information across generations, and do they target conserved molecular pathways?**\nsRNAs are mobile, can target specific sequences, and have been strongly implicated in TGEI, especially in nematodes. We aim to determine if their role is a universal principle.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** A specific repertoire of sRNAs (e.g., piRNAs, endo-siRNAs) is consistently altered in the germline of F0-exposed parents and remains dysregulated in unexposed F2/F3 descendants across multiple species. We predict that our harmonized re-analysis of sRNA-seq datasets will identify a core set of differentially expressed sRNAs that are common to multiple TGEI paradigms. These sRNAs may be orthologous in sequence or belong to conserved biogenesis pathways.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b:** These heritable sRNAs guide epigenetic modifications by targeting homologous sequences in the genome, thereby regulating the expression of genes in conserved biological pathways. We predict that computational target prediction for the identified heritable sRNAs will reveal a significant enrichment for orthologous genes involved in chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, or pathways thematically linked to the initial F0 environmental stimulus (e.g., nutrient sensing pathways for dietary exposures).\n\n**Research Question 3: Is there a unifying 'genomic logic' that determines the susceptibility of genes and pathways to TGEI?**\nWe seek to identify the common features of genes that are targets of TGEI, moving beyond the identity of the epigenetic mark to the characteristics of the underlying genomic locus.\n*   **Hypothesis 3:** Genes susceptible to TGEI are not a random subset of the genome but share intrinsic properties, such as being environmentally responsive, having a specific promoter architecture (e.g., bivalent chromatin domains), or being located in genomic regions that are sensitive to environmental insults. We predict that an integrative analysis combining epigenetic data with genomic features will show that genes with heritable epigenetic changes are significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms (e.g., 'response to stimulus'), are flanked by TEs, and exhibit specific chromatin accessibility signatures in the germline. We will test this by building a predictive model to classify genes as 'TGEI-susceptible' or 'TGEI-resistant' based on these features, which we will then validate across different datasets. By systematically testing these hypotheses, this project will deliver a comprehensive, cross-species map of the molecular events underlying TGEI, providing a robust, data-driven framework for understanding non-genetic inheritance.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that leverages the power of a multidisciplinary working group and publicly available data, fully aligning with the research call's requirements. Our approach is organized into three sequential phases, underpinned by a commitment to open and reproducible science.\n\n**Working Group Composition and Collaboration:**\nOur team comprises experts in *C. elegans* epigenetics (PI 1), mammalian toxicology and epigenomics (PI 2), plant developmental biology (Collaborator 1), and computational biology/bioinformatics (PI 3). This diversity is essential for navigating the species-specific nuances of the data and for the integrative analysis. The working group will convene for an annual in-person workshop and bi-weekly virtual meetings to ensure tight coordination. A dedicated postdoctoral fellow will serve as the central data scientist, with graduate students from each lab contributing to specific analytical modules.\n\n**Phase 1: Systematic Data Identification, Curation, and Standardization (Months 1-12)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on building a comprehensive, high-quality database of TGEI studies.\n*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI GEO, SRA, and ENA, using a carefully constructed set of keywords (e.g., 'transgenerational', 'intergenerational', 'parental exposure', 'epigenetic inheritance') combined with species names (*C. elegans*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, *Mus musculus*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*) and data types ('ChIP-seq', 'WGBS', 'RRBS', 'sRNA-seq', 'RNA-seq').\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:** To ensure rigor, studies will be included only if they meet strict criteria: (1) a documented environmental exposure in the F0 generation; (2) molecular profiling of an unexposed generation (F2 or later to exclude direct gamete exposure); (3) availability of raw sequencing data for both exposed lineages and concurrent controls; (4) detailed metadata describing the experimental design.\n*   **Curation and Database Development:** We will develop a structured TGEI database, capturing over 50 metadata fields for each experiment, including stimulus, dose, duration, sex, tissue, developmental stage, and observed phenotype. This manually curated database will be a key deliverable and a valuable community resource, released publicly at the end of Year 1.\n\n**Phase 2: Harmonized Data Processing and Primary Analysis (Months 10-24)**\nTo enable meaningful comparison across studies, all raw data will be processed through standardized, reproducible pipelines.\n*   **Reproducible Pipelines:** We will use the Nextflow workflow management system to create containerized (Docker/Singularity) pipelines for each data type. This ensures that every dataset, regardless of its origin, is analyzed with identical software versions and parameters. All pipelines will be version-controlled and shared on GitHub.\n*   **Data-Specific Processing:**\n    *   **ChIP-seq:** Reads will be aligned, filtered for quality, and peaks will be called using MACS2. Differential binding analysis will be performed using DiffBind to identify regions with altered histone modifications.\n    *   **Bisulfite-seq (WGBS/RRBS):** Reads will be processed with Bismark to align and quantify methylation levels at single-cytosine resolution. Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) will be identified using a tool like methylKit.\n    *   **sRNA-seq:** Adapters will be trimmed, and reads will be aligned to the genome and known RNA databases. Expression of sRNA classes (miRNA, piRNA, siRNA) will be quantified, and differential expression will be analyzed with DESeq2.\n*   **Quality Control:** A comprehensive QC report (using MultiQC) will be generated for every sample to ensure data quality and identify potential batch effects. Datasets that fail QC will be excluded from the final meta-analysis.\n\n**Phase 3: Integrative, Cross-Species Meta-Analysis (Months 20-36)**\nThis phase addresses our core research questions by synthesizing the processed data.\n*   **Ortholog Mapping:** To compare gene-level effects across species, we will use the Ensembl Compara database to map orthologous genes. This allows us to ask whether the same conserved genes are targeted by TGEI in different species.\n*   **Statistical Meta-Analysis:** We will employ formal meta-analysis techniques to combine results from individual studies. For each hypothesis, we will use methods like Fisher's combined probability test or rank-product analysis to identify genes, genomic regions, or sRNAs that show consistent epigenetic changes across multiple experiments. This approach increases statistical power and identifies robust signals over study-specific noise.\n*   **Pathway and Network Analysis:** We will use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and tools like Reactome to determine if the genes identified in our meta-analysis fall into conserved biological pathways. This will reveal the functional logic of TGEI.\n*   **Integrative Modeling:** To address RQ3, we will integrate multiple data types. We will use machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest classifiers) to identify the genomic and epigenomic features (e.g., proximity to TEs, baseline chromatin state, promoter CpG content) that best predict a gene's susceptibility to heritable epigenetic change.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Launch working group; Finalize data inclusion criteria; Complete systematic data search and curation; Public release of the TGEI study database; Development and validation of analysis pipelines.\n*   **Year 2:** Complete harmonized processing of all datasets; Perform within-species meta-analyses; Present preliminary findings at a major conference; Host a training workshop on our pipelines.\n*   **Year 3:** Conduct cross-species integrative analyses; Test final hypotheses; Prepare and submit 2-3 primary manuscripts; Publicly release all analysis code, summary data, and a web portal for exploring results.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to make transformative contributions to the molecular and cellular biosciences by addressing fundamental questions about non-genetic inheritance. The expected outcomes will provide clarity to a contentious field, generate powerful new resources for the community, and have a broad impact on human health and evolutionary biology.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Definitive Synthesis of TGEI Mechanisms:** The primary scientific outcome will be the first large-scale, systematic synthesis of the molecular evidence for TGEI. By integrating data across species, stimuli, and epigenetic layers, we will identify robust, conserved principles of non-genetic inheritance. Our findings will either converge on a set of core mechanisms (e.g., the primacy of sRNA pathways) or demonstrate that TGEI is fundamentally context-dependent and species-specific. Either conclusion will be a major advance, resolving long-standing debates and providing a clear roadmap for future research.\n2.  **A High-Confidence Catalog of TGEI Effectors:** We will produce a rigorously vetted, cross-species catalog of candidate genes, pathways, small RNAs, and genomic regions implicated in TGEI. This data-driven resource will move the field beyond single-gene studies, enabling researchers to focus experimental validation on the most promising and conserved molecular players. This will significantly accelerate the pace of discovery and improve the efficient allocation of research funding.\n3.  **A Lasting Community Resource and Framework:** A key tangible outcome will be the creation of the TGEI Database and the associated suite of harmonized, open-source analysis pipelines. This platform will serve as an enduring resource for the entire research community, lowering the barrier to entry for labs wishing to perform meta-analyses and ensuring that future TGEI studies can be easily integrated into a common framework. This promotes the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and fosters a more collaborative scientific culture.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Implications for Human Health and Disease:** Our work directly informs the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm. By elucidating the mechanisms through which environmental exposures (e.g., malnutrition, stress, toxicants) can leave a heritable molecular memory, we provide a foundation for understanding how disease risk (e.g., for obesity, diabetes, neurodevelopmental disorders) can be transmitted across generations. This knowledge is critical for developing new strategies for disease prevention and for informing public health policies regarding environmental exposures.\n*   **New Perspectives in Evolutionary Biology:** TGEI provides a potential mechanism for rapid adaptation, allowing populations to respond to environmental changes on a faster timescale than is possible through genetic selection alone. Our project will provide the first comprehensive look at the molecular substrates available for this 'soft' inheritance, offering crucial data for evolutionary theorists modeling the interplay between genetic and epigenetic inheritance in evolution.\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training vehicle. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellow involved will gain deep, hands-on expertise in data synthesis, computational biology, reproducible research practices, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. We will further amplify this impact by hosting an annual virtual workshop, open to the broader community, to train other researchers in our data synthesis methodologies, thereby fulfilling the call's mandate to develop a data-savvy workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**\nOur dissemination strategy includes high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at key international conferences, and a dedicated project website that will serve as a portal to all data, tools, and results. Our long-term vision is for this working group to establish a sustainable 'TGEI Atlas'—a living, community-driven resource that is continuously updated as new data becomes available. This project will not only answer critical current questions but will also build the foundation and collaborative network for the future of TGEI research.",

        "background_and_significance": "Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, is a fundamental biological process with a paradoxical role in health and disease. Initially described as a limit to cellular proliferation in vitro, it is now recognized as a critical tumor suppression mechanism and an essential component of tissue repair and embryonic development. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age is also a major driver of organismal aging and a contributor to a wide range of age-related pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. This dual functionality highlights the complexity and context-dependency of the senescent phenotype, an emergent property arising from intricate molecular networks. The canonical markers used to identify senescent cells—such as senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, expression of cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p21CIP1, and the formation of DNA damage foci—are often inconsistent and lack specificity. Furthermore, a key feature of many senescent cells is the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a complex secretome of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases that can profoundly alter the tissue microenvironment. The composition of the SASP is highly variable, depending on the cell type and the senescence-inducing stressor. This heterogeneity is the central challenge in the field. Recent large-scale data generation efforts have provided tantalizing glimpses into this complexity. Projects like the Tabula Muris Senis have generated single-cell transcriptomic data across the lifespan of mice, revealing age-associated shifts in cell populations that are likely related to senescence. Similarly, proteomic studies have begun to catalog the diversity of the SASP, while high-content imaging screens have documented the profound morphological changes that accompany the senescent transition. However, these valuable datasets remain largely siloed. Transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging, and epigenomic data are typically analyzed in isolation, preventing a holistic understanding of the senescent state. We lack a systematic framework to connect a cell's gene expression program to its morphology, its secretome, and its spatial interactions within a tissue. This fragmentation of knowledge represents a major gap in the field. It prevents the identification of robust, universal biomarkers of senescence and hampers the rational design of senotherapeutics—drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells. The lack of an integrated model means we cannot reliably distinguish between potentially beneficial and pathogenic senescent cells, a critical distinction for therapeutic intervention. This research is both important and timely. With global populations aging rapidly, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging is a paramount public health challenge. Senolytics are already advancing into clinical trials, yet our incomplete understanding of senescence heterogeneity poses a significant risk, as indiscriminate removal of all senescent cells could have unintended negative consequences. The recent explosion in publicly available multi-omics and imaging data, coupled with advances in machine learning and data integration algorithms, creates an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge. A community-scale synthesis effort, as proposed here, is now feasible and necessary to unify these disparate data streams into a coherent model. This project directly addresses the emergent nature of senescence by integrating data across biological scales, a task beyond the scope of any single lab and perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to solve fundamental questions in biosciences.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to construct a multi-scale, integrated 'Senescence Atlas' that systematically defines the core principles and context-dependent heterogeneity of cellular senescence. This atlas will serve as a predictive model of the senescent state, linking molecular programs to cellular morphology and tissue-level function. To achieve this, our working group will address four fundamental research questions.\n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can we establish a comprehensive molecular taxonomy of senescent cell subtypes by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data across diverse tissues, species, and senescence inducers?**\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Senescent cells can be classified into a finite set of distinct, transcriptionally-defined subtypes that represent core functional programs (e.g., 'pro-inflammatory,' 'pro-fibrotic,' 'immunosuppressive'), and these subtypes are conserved across different biological contexts.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** These transcriptional subtypes are governed by specific and recurring patterns of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, which serve as a stable epigenetic memory of the senescent state.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will apply unsupervised clustering algorithms to integrated single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets from public repositories. Subtypes will be defined by robust marker genes and regulatory elements. We will validate the taxonomy by training a machine learning classifier on a subset of the data and testing its ability to accurately classify cells in independent datasets. The expected deliverable is a hierarchical classification of senescence subtypes with detailed molecular signatures.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): Can deep learning models trained on high-resolution imaging data accurately identify senescent cells and do their morphological phenotypes correlate with defined molecular subtypes?**\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to distinguish senescent from non-senescent cells with high accuracy (>90%) based solely on morphological features (e.g., cell size, nuclear shape, organelle texture) extracted from microscopy images.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The quantitative morphological features learned by the CNN will correlate significantly with the molecular subtypes defined in RQ1, establishing a direct link between gene expression programs and the physical phenotype of the cell.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will curate and annotate a large image dataset of senescent and control cells from the Image Data Resource and other public sources. A CNN will be trained and rigorously validated using cross-validation. To test H2b, we will identify datasets with paired imaging and transcriptomic data, allowing us to directly correlate the model's morphological classifications with molecular profiles using statistical methods. The deliverable is a validated, open-source image analysis pipeline for senescence detection.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How does the composition of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) vary across molecular subtypes, and what are the core regulatory networks controlling its expression?**\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The SASP is not a single entity but comprises distinct modules of secreted factors, and the expression of these modules is tightly coupled to specific molecular subtypes of senescent cells.\n*   **Hypothesis 3b:** By integrating proteomic data of the secretome with transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we can identify key transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, C/EBPβ) and signaling pathways that act as master regulators for different SASP modules.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate public proteomic datasets of senescent secretomes with our molecular subtype definitions. We will use weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-secreted proteins and correlate them with subtypes. We will perform transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis on the regulatory regions of SASP genes to validate regulatory hypotheses. The outcome will be a comprehensive map linking SASP composition to cell subtype and its underlying regulatory network.\n\n**Research Question 4 (RQ4): How are senescent cell subtypes spatially organized within tissues, and how do they interact with their microenvironment to drive emergent phenotypes like chronic inflammation?**\n*   **Hypothesis 4a:** The spatial distribution of senescent cells in tissues is non-random, with specific subtypes preferentially localizing to distinct tissue niches or in proximity to particular cell types (e.g., immune cells).\n*   **Hypothesis 4b:** The identity and spatial arrangement of senescent subtypes and their neighbors can predict the local tissue state (e.g., inflammation, fibrosis, immune surveillance), revealing the rules of their collective behavior.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will leverage public spatial transcriptomics datasets. Using our molecular signatures from RQ1, we will deconvolve the identity and location of senescent subtypes. We will then apply spatial statistics to test for non-random co-localization patterns and use ligand-receptor interaction modeling to map potential signaling networks in situ. The deliverable will be a set of 'interaction maps' detailing the social context of different senescent subtypes.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in computational biology, gerontology, computer vision, and spatial omics. The collaborative structure, facilitated by NCEMS, is essential for integrating the diverse data types and analytical approaches required. Our approach is organized around a 3-year timeline with clear milestones and deliverables, all adhering to open science principles.\n\n**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** The project will be co-led by four PIs from different institutions, ensuring a diversity of perspectives. The team will include two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students who will work across labs, fostering a deeply collaborative and interdisciplinary training environment. Collaboration will be managed through weekly virtual meetings, quarterly in-person workshops hosted by NCEMS, a shared Slack channel for daily communication, and a centralized GitHub organization for all code and analysis pipelines. This structure demonstrates a clear need for NCEMS support to facilitate a level of interaction beyond a standard multi-PI grant.\n\n**Data Acquisition and Curation (Milestone 1: Months 1-6):** Our first major task is to build a comprehensive, curated database of publicly available senescence-related data. We will systematically mine repositories including NCBI GEO, SRA, ENCODE, ProteomeXchange, Image Data Resource (IDR), and the Human Cell Atlas. A standardized metadata schema will be developed to capture critical experimental variables (species, tissue, cell type, senescence inducer, protocol). Datasets will include:\n*   **Transcriptomics:** Over 100 single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets from aged or diseased tissues (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis) and numerous bulk RNA-seq datasets from in vitro senescence models.\n*   **Epigenomics:** Publicly available scATAC-seq, CUT&RUN, and ChIP-seq data for key histone marks (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K9me3) and DNA methylation arrays from well-characterized senescent systems.\n*   **Proteomics:** Mass spectrometry datasets of conditioned media from senescent cells cataloged in ProteomeXchange and other repositories.\n*   **Imaging:** High-content microscopy screens from IDR and other sources, featuring morphological and marker-based staining of senescent cells.\n*   **Spatial Omics:** Public Visium, MIBI-TOF, and MERFISH datasets from tissues known to accumulate senescent cells, such as fibrotic lung and aged skin.\n*   **Deliverable:** A public, searchable catalog of all curated datasets with standardized metadata.\n\n**Analytical Plan:**\n*   **Aim 1: Molecular Subtype Definition (Milestone 2: Months 7-18):** We will develop and apply a standardized computational pipeline for processing all transcriptomic and epigenomic data. Data integration will be performed using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Harmony, Seurat v4) to correct for batch effects. We will then use graph-based clustering (e.g., Leiden) on the integrated latent space to identify putative senescent subtypes. These subtypes will be characterized by identifying differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns. The robustness of the subtypes will be validated across datasets and species.\n*   **Aim 2: Morphological Phenotyping (Milestone 3: Months 7-24):** Images will be preprocessed using a pipeline built with CellProfiler and Python libraries. We will employ a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) on our annotated image dataset to classify cells. The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated. We will use explainable AI techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) to identify the key morphological features driving classification. These features will then be statistically correlated with the molecular subtypes from Aim 1 using datasets where both data types are available.\n*   **Aim 3: SASP Characterization (Milestone 4: Months 12-30):** Proteomic data will be re-analyzed through a uniform pipeline to ensure comparability. We will map secreted proteins to their genes and test for the enrichment of specific protein sets within our transcriptomic subtypes. Regulatory network inference tools (e.g., SCENIC) will be applied to the integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic data to identify transcription factors that regulate subtype-specific SASP modules.\n*   **Aim 4: Spatial Analysis (Milestone 5: Months 18-36):** We will use our molecular subtype signatures as a reference to deconvolve the spatial locations of senescent cells in spatial transcriptomics data using tools like cell2location. Following deconvolution, we will apply a suite of spatial statistics tools (e.g., from the `squidpy` library) to analyze neighborhood compositions, cell-cell interactions, and niche organization. Ligand-receptor modeling will predict signaling pathways active between senescent cells and their microenvironment.\n\n**Timeline and Open Science:**\n*   **Year 1:** Data curation, pipeline development, initial molecular subtype definition, and image model training.\n*   **Year 2:** Refinement of subtypes, integration with proteomics and imaging, and initial spatial analysis.\n*   **Year 3:** Final multi-modal integration, construction of the interactive Senescence Atlas web portal, manuscript preparation, and community workshops.\nAll code will be developed openly on GitHub with version control. All processed data, analysis results, and trained models will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Model Zoo) with detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility and community reuse.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of aging biology, cell biology, and translational medicine. Its impact will be felt through the creation of a foundational public resource, the generation of novel biological insights, the development of new analytical tools, and the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **The Senescence Atlas:** The primary deliverable will be a first-of-its-kind, multi-scale 'Senescence Atlas,' delivered as an open-access, interactive web portal. This will not be a static repository but a dynamic knowledge base allowing researchers to explore the connections between genes, proteins, cell morphologies, and tissue locations across dozens of contexts. It will become an indispensable resource for the aging research community, analogous to resources like the Human Cell Atlas or the ENCODE portal.\n2.  **A Data-Driven Taxonomy of Senescence:** We will replace the current ambiguous and qualitative descriptions of senescence with a robust, quantitative classification of senescent subtypes. This new taxonomy, based on the integration of thousands of data points, will provide a common language for the field, resolve long-standing controversies, and allow for the re-interpretation of previous studies in a new, more precise context.\n3.  **Robust, Multi-Modal Biomarkers:** By identifying the core molecular and morphological features that are conserved across different senescent subtypes and contexts, this project will deliver a panel of validated, high-confidence biomarkers. This will overcome a major bottleneck in the field, enabling more reliable detection and quantification of senescent cells in both research and clinical settings.\n4.  **A Novel Integrative Analytical Framework:** We will develop and disseminate a powerful, open-source computational workflow for synthesizing multi-modal biological data (genomics, proteomics, imaging, spatial-omics). This framework will be a valuable resource in itself, adaptable by other researchers to study different complex biological phenomena characterized by heterogeneity and emergent properties.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Accelerating Senotherapeutics:** Our findings will have a direct and immediate impact on the development of drugs targeting senescent cells. By defining subtype-specific vulnerabilities and SASP profiles, the atlas will enable the design of next-generation, precision senolytics that can target pathogenic senescent cells while sparing those with beneficial functions. This will lead to more effective and safer therapies for a host of age-related diseases.\n*   **Enhancing Diagnostics:** The machine learning models for image-based senescence detection have the potential to be translated into digital pathology tools. This could provide clinicians with a quantitative, automated method to assess senescent cell burden in patient biopsies, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of treatment response.\n*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is intrinsically designed to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interface of biology, data science, and machine learning. Through the NCEMS working group model, trainees will gain invaluable experience in large-scale data analysis, collaborative team science, and open-source software development, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-driven biomedical workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**\nOur commitment to open science will ensure maximum impact. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. The Senescence Atlas web portal will be our primary means of dissemination to the research community. We will actively promote its use through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., GSA, ASCB, ISMB) and by hosting hands-on workshops to train users. The atlas is envisioned as a living resource, designed with a flexible architecture to incorporate new public datasets as they become available. We will seek follow-on funding to ensure its long-term maintenance and expansion, establishing a permanent, community-driven resource that will catalyze research and discovery in aging biology for many years to come.",

The project's success hinges on the deep integration of diverse expertise and the dedicated resources for data management, computational analysis, and collaborative coordination that the NCEMS working group model is uniquely positioned to provide. A conventional funding mechanism would not adequately support the intensive, cross-disciplinary personnel effort and the collaborative infrastructure required to synthesize petabytes of heterogeneous data into a unified, public-facing resource.\n\n**Budget Justification and Breakdown (3-Year Total Request):**\n\n*   **A. Personnel ($650,000):** The majority of the budget is allocated to personnel, reflecting the project's focus on data analysis, tool development, and training.\n    *   **Postdoctoral Fellows (2.0 FTE x 3 years):** Two dedicated postdocs are essential. Postdoc 1 will focus on the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic data to define molecular subtypes (Aims 1 & 3).

        "background_and_significance": "The central dogma of molecular biology has long focused on the flow of genetic information from DNA to protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to functional proteins. However, landmark genomics projects like ENCODE and FANTOM have revealed a surprising truth: the vast majority of the human genome is pervasively transcribed, yet less than 2% codes for proteins. This discovery has unveiled a massive, largely unexplored world of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)—transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with no apparent protein-coding potential—have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression and cellular function. Tens of thousands of lncRNAs have been annotated, but the biological roles of over 98% remain completely unknown, representing one of the most significant knowledge gaps in modern molecular biology. Seminal studies on a few well-characterized lncRNAs have provided tantalizing glimpses into their diverse mechanisms. For example, *XIST* orchestrates X-chromosome inactivation through epigenetic silencing, *HOTAIR* acts as a scaffold for chromatin-modifying complexes to regulate developmental genes, and *MALAT1* modulates alternative splicing in the nucleus. These examples have led to the formulation of functional archetypes for lncRNAs, which can act as 'signals' (indicators of transcriptional activity), 'decoys' (titrating away proteins or microRNAs), 'guides' (directing enzymes to specific genomic loci), or 'scaffolds' (assembling multi-component molecular complexes). Despite these foundational discoveries, our understanding is limited to a handful of exemplars. The sheer number of lncRNAs makes a one-by-one experimental approach intractable and economically infeasible. Consequently, there is an urgent need for systematic, scalable methods to predict lncRNA function. Previous computational efforts have laid important groundwork but suffer from key limitations. Many approaches rely on a single data type, such as 'guilt-by-association' based on co-expression with protein-coding genes. While useful, expression correlation is often noisy and does not distinguish between direct and indirect effects. Other methods use genomic proximity to infer targets, a principle that fails to account for the widespread long-range regulation mediated by lncRNAs in the three-dimensional nucleus. Databases like LncRNAdb and LncBook have cataloged functional information for known lncRNAs, but they do not provide predictive power for the uncharacterized majority. The critical gap in the field is the lack of a comprehensive framework that can integrate the multi-modal molecular features of lncRNAs—their expression, their protein-binding partners, their structural motifs, and their chromosomal context—to derive a holistic understanding of their function. This research is exceptionally timely due to the recent explosion of publicly available, relevant datasets. The ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated comprehensive maps of transcription, chromatin states, and RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactions (e.g., eCLIP-seq) across hundreds of cell types. Concurrently, projects like the 4D Nucleome (4DN) have mapped the 3D architecture of the genome (e.g., Hi-C), providing the missing link between lncRNAs and their distal gene targets. The time is ripe to synthesize these disparate, massive datasets to construct a 'functional grammar' for the non-coding transcriptome. This project proposes to fill this critical gap by creating a unified computational framework to systematically classify lncRNAs and predict their mechanisms of action, thereby providing a foundational resource to guide future experimental investigation and unlock the biological significance of the dark matter of the genome.",

We aim to move beyond simple cataloging to create a predictive 'functional grammar' that can classify lncRNAs into mechanistic archetypes and generate high-confidence, testable hypotheses about their biological functions. To achieve this, we will address four primary research questions (RQs).\n\nRQ1: Can we systematically partition the human lncRNAome into functional modules by integrating their expression patterns, RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactomes, subcellular localization, and 3D chromatin contacts? This question addresses whether the combined molecular properties of lncRNAs can reveal higher-order organization corresponding to shared biological pathways or regulatory circuits.\n\nH1: We hypothesize that lncRNAs with similar RBP binding profiles, co-expression patterns across diverse cell types, and spatial proximity to similar gene targets will form distinct functional modules. We predict that applying community detection algorithms to a multi-layered network representing these data types will reveal clusters of lncRNAs and proteins. These modules will be significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms or KEGG pathways, reflecting their collective role in a biological process. We will validate this by demonstrating that our integrated modules show stronger functional coherence than modules derived from any single data type alone and by confirming that well-characterized lncRNAs cluster with their known protein partners and target pathways.\n\nRQ2: Can a predictive model be developed to accurately assign lncRNAs to specific mechanistic archetypes (e.g., scaffold, guide, decoy, enhancer-associated) based on their integrated molecular features? This question seeks to establish a systematic classification scheme for lncRNA function.\n\nH2: We hypothesize that a machine learning classifier, trained on features derived from well-characterized lncRNAs, can accurately predict the functional archetype for uncharacterized lncRNAs. We predict that a model (e.g., XGBoost) will achieve high cross-validation accuracy (>80%). Key predictive features will include the number and diversity of RBP partners (indicative of a 'scaffold'), strong association with a single chromatin modifier and a specific genomic locus (a 'guide'), or transcription from an active enhancer region (an 'enhancer' lncRNA). Validation will involve testing the model on a held-out set of known lncRNAs and performing in silico validation by correlating our predictions with orthogonal data, such as disease associations from GWAS catalogs.\n\nRQ3: How do the structural features of lncRNAs, such as secondary structure motifs, correlate with their functional classification and RBP binding partners? This question explores the role of RNA structure in dictating function.\n\nH3: We hypothesize that specific, evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structure motifs are predictive of binding by distinct RBP families and are associated with specific functional archetypes. We predict that statistical analysis will reveal significant correlations between structural motifs (e.g., G-quadruplexes, complex stem-loops) and the binding sites of RBPs with known structural preferences. For example, lncRNAs predicted to be 'scaffolds' will be enriched for multiple, distinct structural domains capable of hosting diverse proteins. We will validate this by building a structure-based model of RBP binding and testing its predictive power on eCLIP datasets.\n\nRQ4: Can we generate high-confidence, testable hypotheses about the specific gene targets and regulatory pathways for thousands of previously uncharacterized lncRNAs?\n\nH4: We hypothesize that by using network propagation algorithms on our integrated multi-layered network, we can accurately predict the protein-coding gene targets of lncRNAs. We predict that this method, which leverages multiple evidence types simultaneously (co-expression, 3D proximity, shared RBP partners), will outperform predictions based on any single data type. The outcome will be a ranked list of target genes for each lncRNA. We will validate our predictions by showing that our predicted lncRNA-gene pairs are significantly more likely to be co-cited in literature and share functional annotations than random pairs.\n\nExpected Deliverables: The project will produce several key deliverables: 1) A comprehensive, integrated multi-layered network of lncRNA interactions. 2) A systematic catalog of lncRNA functional modules. 3) A robust, validated machine learning model for predicting lncRNA functional archetypes. 4) The 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' a publicly accessible web portal containing all data and predictions. 5) A prioritized list of high-confidence functional hypotheses for at least 1,000 uncharacterized lncRNAs to guide experimental validation by the broader community.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed in four integrated phases, leveraging a transdisciplinary team with expertise in computational biology, RNA biology, and data science. Our approach is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and compliant with open science principles.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Processing, and Integration (Months 1-12)**\nThis foundational phase involves the collection and uniform processing of multiple large-scale public datasets. We will develop a reproducible data processing pipeline using Snakemake to ensure consistency and facilitate future updates.\n*   **LncRNA Annotation and Expression:** We will use the GENCODE (v43+) comprehensive lncRNA catalog as our reference. LncRNA expression will be quantified from uniformly processed RNA-seq data from the GTEx (v8) and ENCODE (v5) projects, covering thousands of samples across diverse human tissues and cell lines. This will yield a rich expression matrix.\n*   **RNA-Protein Interactions:** We will download and process all available human eCLIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE portal (>400 experiments for >150 RBPs). Raw reads will be mapped and peaks will be called using a standardized pipeline (e.g., CLIPper) to generate a comprehensive lncRNA-RBP binding matrix.\n*   **3D Genome Architecture:** To link lncRNAs to their distal targets, we will utilize high-resolution Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and HiChIP data from the 4D Nucleome (4DN) portal and ENCODE. Significant chromatin loops connecting lncRNA promoters to gene promoters will be identified using established tools (e.g., Fit-Hi-C).\n*   **Chromatin State and Accessibility:** We will leverage imputed 25-state ChromHMM models from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and ENCODE to annotate the genomic context of each lncRNA. This will allow us to identify lncRNAs transcribed from active enhancers (eRNAs), promoters, or repressed regions.\n*   **RNA Structure:** We will compute secondary structure predictions for all lncRNAs using tools like RNAfold and IPknot. Where available, we will integrate experimental structure-probing data (e.g., SHAPE-MaP) to refine these models. Structural motifs will be identified using specialized search algorithms.\nAll processed data will be stored in a centralized, version-controlled database for efficient access.\n\n**Phase 2: Multi-Layered Network Construction and Module Identification (Months 10-20)**\nTo synthesize these diverse data modalities, we will construct a heterogeneous, multi-layered network. Nodes in the network will represent lncRNAs, protein-coding genes, and RBPs. Edges will represent different types of functional relationships, forming distinct layers:\n*   **Layer 1 (Co-expression):** Weighted edges between all RNA nodes based on their Pearson correlation across GTEx and ENCODE samples.\n*   **Layer 2 (RBP Binding):** Edges connecting lncRNAs to the RBPs that bind them, based on eCLIP peaks.\n*   **Layer 3 (Chromatin Interaction):** Edges connecting lncRNA loci to gene loci based on significant Hi-C loops.\n*   **Layer 4 (Protein-Protein Interaction):** Edges connecting RBPs based on known interactions from the STRING database.\nTo identify functional modules (RQ1), we will apply community detection algorithms designed for multi-layered networks, such as Infomap or MultiNMF. These algorithms will identify dense subgraphs of lncRNAs, RBPs, and genes that are highly interconnected across multiple evidence layers. The resulting modules will be functionally characterized via enrichment analysis for GO terms, KEGG pathways, and disease associations.\n\n**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling of LncRNA Functional Archetypes (Months 18-30)**\nTo address RQ2 and RQ3, we will develop a machine learning framework. First, we will curate a 'gold standard' training set of ~200 lncRNAs with well-documented functions from literature (e.g., from LncRNAdb, LncBook) and manually assign them to one of four archetypes: 'scaffold', 'guide', 'decoy', or 'enhancer'. For every lncRNA, we will engineer a comprehensive feature vector comprising:\n*   *Network Features:* Node degree, betweenness centrality, module membership.\n*   *Binding Features:* Number and diversity of bound RBPs, binding affinity of specific protein families (e.g., chromatin modifiers, splicing factors).\n*   *Genomic Features:* Chromatin state at the promoter, evolutionary conservation score (phyloP).\n*   *Expression Features:* Maximum expression level, tissue-specificity score (Tau).\n*   *Structural Features:* Presence of conserved motifs, overall structural complexity.\nWe will train a multi-class XGBoost classifier on this feature set using 10-fold cross-validation. Feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP values) will be used to identify the key molecular properties that define each functional class. The trained model will then be applied to predict the functional archetype for all uncharacterized lncRNAs.\n\n**Phase 4: Hypothesis Generation and Dissemination (Months 24-36)**\nTo generate high-confidence hypotheses about lncRNA targets (RQ4), we will employ network propagation algorithms (e.g., Random Walk with Restart) on the integrated network. For a given lncRNA, this method identifies genes that are 'close' in the network by considering all possible paths through multiple layers, effectively integrating all available evidence. This will produce a ranked list of putative targets for each lncRNA. The final output of our work will be the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' a user-friendly web portal where users can search for any lncRNA and visualize its predicted module, archetype, features, and targets. All code and processed data will be made available on GitHub and Zenodo.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology by providing a systematic framework for understanding the function of the non-coding genome. Our contributions will be multifaceted, spanning the creation of a foundational community resource, the development of a novel analytical paradigm, and the generation of thousands of testable biological hypotheses.\n\n**Primary Outcome: The lncRNA Functional Atlas**\nThe principal deliverable will be the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' a comprehensive, publicly accessible web resource. This will be the first-of-its-kind platform to provide systematic, evidence-based functional predictions for the vast majority of human lncRNAs. Unlike existing databases that catalog known information, our Atlas will be predictive. It will enable any researcher, regardless of their computational expertise, to query a lncRNA of interest and receive a rich, multi-layered summary of its predicted functional module, mechanistic archetype (e.g., scaffold, guide), key protein interactors, and putative gene targets, complete with confidence scores and links to the underlying evidence. This will democratize access to complex genomic data synthesis and serve as an essential hypothesis-generation tool for the entire biomedical research community.\n\n**Contribution to the Field: A New Paradigm for Data Synthesis**\nMethodologically, this project will establish a powerful new paradigm for functional genomics. By demonstrating the utility of a multi-layered network approach to integrate disparate data types—transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and structural—we will create a blueprint for holistic analysis of gene regulation. This analytical framework will be highly generalizable and can be adapted to study other classes of non-coding elements (e.g., circular RNAs, enhancers) or applied to different species, thereby providing a durable contribution to computational biology.\n\n**Broader Impact: Accelerating Biomedical Discovery and Understanding Disease**\nOur work will have a profound impact on biomedical research. Currently, a biologist who discovers a novel lncRNA associated with a disease faces a daunting, resource-intensive path to determine its function. Our Atlas will dramatically accelerate this process. By providing high-confidence predictions, it will allow researchers to bypass years of exploratory work and immediately design targeted experiments to validate specific mechanisms. This will lower the barrier to entry for studying lncRNAs and catalyze new research directions. Furthermore, many lncRNAs are implicated in complex human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. By annotating the function of these disease-associated lncRNAs, our work will provide crucial insights into their roles in pathogenesis. For example, identifying a cancer-upregulated lncRNA as a 'guide' for an oncogenic chromatin modifier would immediately suggest a tangible mechanism and a potential therapeutic target.\n\n**Training and Collaboration**\nThis project is intrinsically aligned with the NCEMS mission to train the next generation of data-savvy scientists. The working group structure will provide an exceptional cross-disciplinary training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in large-scale data management, network biology, machine learning, and open science practices—a skill set in high demand. We will further broaden our educational impact by hosting annual virtual workshops to train the wider community on using the Atlas and our analytical tools, fostering a collaborative ecosystem around non-coding RNA research.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision**\nWe are committed to open science principles. All findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. The web portal, all underlying processed data, and all analysis code will be made freely available via GitHub and public repositories like Zenodo, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Our long-term vision is for the lncRNA Functional Atlas to become a living resource. The pipeline we develop will be automated and scalable, allowing us to periodically incorporate new public datasets as they are released, continuously refining and expanding the predictions. This project will establish a durable collaborative network and a computational foundation for a sustained, community-wide effort to illuminate the dark matter of the genome.",

        "background_and_significance": "The ability of a cell to sense, respond, and adapt to environmental stress is a fundamental property of life. From bacteria to humans, organisms are equipped with sophisticated molecular networks that mitigate damage and ensure survival in the face of insults such as temperature shifts, nutrient scarcity, oxidative damage, and exposure to toxins. For decades, molecular and cellular biology has successfully dissected individual stress response pathways in remarkable detail. Seminal research has elucidated the Heat Shock Response (HSR) governed by HSF1, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that monitors proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the DNA Damage Response (DDR) orchestrated by kinases like ATM and ATR, and the Oxidative Stress Response mediated by transcription factors like Nrf2/SKN-1. These studies have provided a deep, yet fragmented, understanding of cellular defense mechanisms. Typically, they focus on a single stressor, a single pathway, and often a single model organism. This reductionist approach, while powerful, has created a significant knowledge gap: we lack a holistic, systems-level understanding of how these distinct pathways are integrated to produce a coherent, robust cellular response. Early genomic studies, such as the landmark work by Gasch et al. (2000) in yeast, revealed a common 'Environmental Stress Response' (ESR), a shared transcriptional program activated by diverse stressors. This provided the first glimpse that beneath stressor-specific adaptations lies a more universal, core program. However, these early studies were limited by the available data and analytical tools. They could not fully decompose the response into its constituent parts, identify the master regulators coordinating the network across different stress types, or generalize these findings across diverse eukaryotic species. Today, we are at a critical juncture. Public data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and the Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE) have become vast digital libraries, housing hundreds of thousands of datasets from experiments probing cellular responses to a myriad of perturbations. Concurrently, advances in computational biology, data science, and machine learning have equipped us with powerful tools for data integration, network inference, and predictive modeling. The time is therefore ripe for a community-scale synthesis effort to integrate this wealth of existing data and address fundamental questions about the emergent property of cellular resilience. This research is critically important because a fragmented understanding of stress responses limits our ability to tackle complex biological problems. Chronic, unresolved cellular stress is a unifying feature of aging and a wide range of human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases (proteotoxic stress), cancer (genotoxic and metabolic stress), and cardiovascular disease (oxidative stress). A systems-level map of the stress response network would provide a powerful framework for understanding the common molecular underpinnings of these disparate diseases. Furthermore, in toxicology and environmental science, we need better methods to predict the cellular impact of the thousands of novel chemicals introduced into our environment. By uncovering the universal principles of stress adaptation, this project will not only solve a long-standing puzzle in fundamental cell biology but also provide actionable insights with broad translational and societal impact. This proposal directly aligns with the research call's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to synthesize public data, answer novel questions about emergence phenomena, and train the next generation of data-savvy biologists.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research project is designed to transition the study of cellular stress from a collection of individual pathways to an integrated, systems-level science. Our central goal is to define the universal organizational principles of the eukaryotic stress response by synthesizing a massive corpus of public transcriptomic and proteomic data. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research questions, each with a corresponding testable hypothesis. \n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can the global cellular response to diverse environmental stressors be computationally decomposed into a conserved, 'core' functional program and a set of stressor-specific 'peripheral' modules?**\nWe hypothesize that a substantial and identifiable component of the molecular response is common across a wide array of stressors, constituting a 'Core Stress Response' (CSR). This CSR represents a general survival strategy. We predict this core module will be highly conserved across yeast, flies, worms, and human cells and will be functionally enriched for fundamental processes such as protein quality control (chaperones, proteasome), metabolic reprogramming towards conservation and repair, broad-spectrum detoxification, and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, we hypothesize that 'peripheral' modules will be activated by smaller, specific subsets of stressors and will be enriched for functions that directly counteract a particular insult, such as specific DNA repair enzymes for genotoxins or osmolyte transporters for osmotic shock. To test this, we will apply matrix factorization methods to our integrated multi-species expression dataset. The successful identification of a large, functionally coherent module activated across the majority of stress conditions, alongside smaller, functionally specific modules activated by distinct stressor classes, would validate our hypothesis. The primary deliverable for this aim will be a comprehensive catalog of core and peripheral stress response modules, functionally annotated and conserved across species.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the key regulatory hubs, such as transcription factors and signaling kinases, that orchestrate the Core Stress Response and integrate signals from diverse stress-sensing pathways?**\nWe hypothesize that the CSR is not a simple aggregation of independent pathways but is coordinated by a limited set of master regulatory hubs that function as signal integrators. We predict that these hubs will include well-established stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) like HSF1, ATF4, and p53, as well as key signaling nodes like the MAPK and TOR pathways. Our hypothesis states that these factors will be identified by network inference algorithms as having high centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness) and connectivity specifically to the genes within the CSR module. To test this, we will construct a global regulatory network from our expression data. We will then validate our computationally predicted hubs by cross-referencing with orthogonal public data, such as ChIP-seq databases (e.g., ENCODE) and kinase-substrate databases. We expect to find significant enrichment of the binding motifs for our predicted hub TFs in the promoter regions of CSR genes, providing strong evidence for their direct regulatory role. The expected outcome is a high-confidence map of the core regulatory circuit governing cellular resilience.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can a predictive model be built to accurately forecast the cellular response profile—specifically, the pattern of core and peripheral module activation—to a novel, uncharacterized stressor?**\nWe hypothesize that the cellular response signature is a predictable, emergent property determined by the type of damage a stressor inflicts. Therefore, a machine learning model can learn the relationship between a stressor's physicochemical properties or known mode of action and the resulting transcriptional and proteomic fingerprint. We predict that a model trained on our large, diverse dataset can forecast which specific combination of our previously defined modules will be activated by a new chemical or environmental insult. To test this, we will train a multi-label classification model (e.g., a random forest or neural network) using stressor features as input and the module activation state as output. We will rigorously evaluate the model's predictive power using a leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation strategy. Success will be defined by the model's ability to achieve high accuracy (e.g., AUC > 0.8) in predicting the activation profile for held-out stressors. The deliverable will be a validated, open-source computational tool for in silico toxicogenomics and stress response prediction.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary Working Group comprising a systems biologist (PI 1), a cell biologist/toxicologist (PI 2), and a data scientist (PI 3), along with their trainees. This structure ensures that deep expertise in computational analysis, biological interpretation, and statistical rigor are integrated at every stage. The project is organized into a logical progression of five phases with clear milestones.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Curation (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on assembling the comprehensive dataset required for synthesis. We will perform systematic, keyword-based searches of public repositories, primarily NCBI GEO, EBI ArrayExpress (transcriptomics), and PRIDE/MassIVE (proteomics). Our search will target datasets from four key eukaryotic models: *S. cerevisiae*, *D. melanogaster*, *C. elegans*, and human cell lines (*H. sapiens*). Inclusion criteria are stringent: studies must contain appropriate unstressed controls, provide accessible raw or processed data, and have sufficient metadata to characterize the perturbation. We aim to collate over 500 individual datasets, encompassing more than 50 distinct stressors (e.g., heat shock, sodium arsenite, tunicamycin, doxorubicin, UV radiation, glucose starvation). A team of trainees, supervised by the PIs, will manually curate all relevant metadata into a standardized, machine-readable format. This curated metadata catalog will be a key project deliverable.\n\n**Phase 2: Unified Data Processing and Normalization (Months 4-9)**\nTo enable meaningful integration, data from disparate sources must be processed through a single, uniform pipeline to minimize technical artifacts and batch effects. For all RNA-seq datasets, we will download the raw FASTQ files and process them using a standardized workflow (e.g., STAR for alignment, featureCounts for quantification). For microarray data, raw files will be processed using platform-specific standardized methods (e.g., RMA). Proteomics data will be re-analyzed from raw spectra using a consistent search engine (e.g., MaxQuant). Following initial processing, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq) to the combined expression matrices. The success of our normalization will be rigorously assessed using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), ensuring that biological variance (stressor type, cell type) dominates over technical variance (study of origin). Finally, to facilitate cross-species comparisons, all gene and protein identifiers will be mapped to ortholog groups using the OrthoDB database.\n\n**Phase 3: Decomposing the Stress Response (Aim 1; Months 10-18)**\nWith the normalized, integrated data matrix, we will address RQ1. We will employ Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an unsupervised machine learning technique well-suited for identifying component parts in complex biological data. NMF will decompose the expression matrix into a set of co-regulated gene modules and their corresponding activation patterns across all experimental conditions. We will determine the optimal number of modules using consensus clustering and model stability metrics. Each resulting module will be subjected to extensive functional annotation using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) against GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway databases. A module will be classified as 'core' if its activation pattern is significant across a high percentage (>75%) of diverse stress conditions; otherwise, it will be classified as 'peripheral'.\n\n**Phase 4: Inferring the Core Regulatory Network (Aim 2; Months 15-24)**\nTo identify the regulators of the Core Stress Response (CSR), we will apply network inference algorithms. We will use methods like ARACNE or GENIE3, which can infer regulatory relationships (e.g., transcription factor to target gene) from large-scale expression data. We will build a global regulatory network and identify hub proteins by calculating network centrality measures. To validate these computationally-derived hubs, we will perform two orthogonal analyses. First, we will test for the statistical enrichment of known transcription factor binding motifs (from databases like JASPAR) in the promoter regions of genes within the CSR module. Second, we will cross-reference our inferred regulatory links with experimentally-verified interactions from public ChIP-seq and protein-protein interaction databases.\n\n**Phase 5: Developing a Predictive Model (Aim 3; Months 20-30)**\nTo address RQ3, we will build a predictive model. For chemical stressors, we will generate a feature vector describing their physicochemical properties using tools like RDKit (e.g., Morgan fingerprints, molecular weight). We will then train a multi-label random forest classifier. The input to the model will be the stressor's feature vector, and the output will be a binary vector indicating the activation state ('on' or 'off') of each of our previously identified stress modules. The model's performance will be assessed using a rigorous leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation scheme, measuring metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall. A high-performing model will demonstrate that the cellular response is a predictable emergent property of the stressor's characteristics.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on biomedical research and environmental science. Our contributions will be both conceptual and practical, providing new knowledge, powerful resources, and a new generation of trained scientists.\n\n**Intellectual and Scientific Contributions:**\nThe primary outcome will be a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular stress. By moving beyond the study of isolated pathways, we will deliver the first **Unified Map of the Eukaryotic Stress Response Network**. This map will detail the components of a conserved **Core Stress Response (CSR)** and a diverse array of stressor-specific peripheral modules. This provides a concrete, data-driven definition of cellular resilience, an emergent property that has been conceptually important but difficult to define mechanistically. Our identification of the **master regulatory hubs** that orchestrate the CSR will pinpoint the critical integration nodes in the cell's decision-making circuitry, revealing how diverse threat signals are channeled into a coherent survival program. These findings will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, fundamentally altering textbook models of cell biology.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe knowledge and tools generated will have significant translational potential. In **disease biology**, our framework will illuminate the common molecular underpinnings of aging and chronic diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration, which share a foundation of unresolved cellular stress. The regulatory hubs of the CSR represent novel therapeutic targets for developing 'resilience-enhancing' drugs that could broadly protect against age-related cellular decline. In **toxicology and drug development**, our predictive model (Aim 3) will constitute a powerful new **in silico screening tool**. It will enable the rapid prediction of a novel chemical's cellular impact and mode of action from its structure alone, reducing costs, accelerating safety testing, and aligning with the '3Rs' goal of reducing animal testing.\n\n**Open Science and Community Resources:**\nIn alignment with the research call's principles, all outcomes will be made openly available to the scientific community. We will develop a **publicly accessible web portal** that will serve as a central resource. This portal will provide interactive access to our integrated, normalized dataset, the defined gene/protein modules, the inferred regulatory networks, and our predictive model. This will empower researchers worldwide to explore our data, test their own hypotheses, and accelerate their research. All analytical code, pipelines, and workflows will be meticulously documented and shared on a public GitHub repository with a permissive open-source license, ensuring full reproducibility and reusability.\n\n**Training and Workforce Development:**\nThis project is intrinsically designed as a training platform. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the Working Group, receiving immersive, hands-on training at the intersection of cell biology, data science, and systems biology. They will gain invaluable skills in managing large-scale data, developing robust computational pipelines, and working within a collaborative, multidisciplinary team—precisely the skills needed for the future biomedical workforce. We will foster their development through regular joint lab meetings, an annual in-person 'data-thon' workshop, and co-mentorship from all PIs. This project will thus directly contribute to training the next generation of leaders in data-intensive biological research.\n\n**Long-Term Vision:**\nThis project will lay the foundation for a long-term, sustainable research program. The created data resource and analytical framework will be extensible, allowing for the future incorporation of new data types (e.g., metabolomics, epigenomics) and new organisms. The collaborative network established through this Working Group will foster follow-up projects, such as experimentally validating novel hub regulators or applying our predictive model in partnership with environmental agencies or pharmaceutical companies.",

        "background_and_significance": "Cellular quiescence, or G0, is a state of reversible cell cycle arrest that represents a fundamental alternative to proliferation. Unlike terminal differentiation or senescence, which are typically irreversible endpoints, quiescence is a dynamic and actively maintained state that is critical for the survival and function of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Its biological significance is vast, underpinning the long-term maintenance of adult stem cell pools (e.g., hematopoietic, neural, and muscle stem cells), enabling tissue repair, facilitating immune memory through long-lived lymphocytes, and contributing to organismal longevity. Conversely, the dysregulation of quiescence is a hallmark of numerous pathologies. The failure of stem cells to properly enter or exit quiescence contributes to age-related decline in regenerative capacity, while the ability of disseminated tumor cells to enter a dormant, quiescent state allows them to evade therapy and seed metastatic relapse years or decades after initial treatment. Despite its central importance, our understanding of quiescence remains remarkably fragmented. The field has historically studied this phenomenon in disparate model systems, from nutrient-starved yeast to contact-inhibited fibroblasts and in vivo stem cell populations. This has led to the identification of key context-specific regulators. For instance, work in mammalian cells has highlighted the crucial role of CDK inhibitors like p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 in establishing the G0 arrest. The suppression of growth-promoting signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, and the activation of stress-responsive pathways involving FOXO transcription factors are recognized as common themes. Metabolically, quiescent cells are known to downregulate anabolic processes and shift towards catabolic pathways like autophagy and fatty acid oxidation to maintain cellular integrity with minimal energy expenditure. Recent advances, particularly in single-cell transcriptomics, have revealed further complexity, demonstrating that quiescence is not a monolithic state but rather a spectrum of 'depths,' from a shallow, 'G0-alert' state poised for rapid cell cycle re-entry to a deep, more refractory state of dormancy. However, a major gap in our knowledge persists: the lack of a unified, systems-level model of the quiescent state. Current research exists in silos, with findings from yeast, cultured cells, and primary tissues rarely integrated. Consequently, we lack a definitive, universal molecular signature that defines a cell as 'quiescent' across all biological contexts. It remains unclear which molecular features constitute a 'core' quiescence program conserved through evolution, and which represent context-specific adaptations. The explosion of publicly available multi-omics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to address this gap. Thousands of transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic datasets from diverse quiescence models are available in public repositories like GEO, SRA, and PRIDE. Yet, these rich resources have not been systematically synthesized. This project is therefore both important and timely. It is important because a unified understanding of quiescence will provide a foundational framework for rationally manipulating this state in regenerative medicine, oncology, and aging research. It is timely because the confluence of massive public data availability and sophisticated computational methods for data integration and machine learning now makes it possible to tackle this grand challenge. By forming a multidisciplinary working group to synthesize this data, we can move beyond single-gene, single-pathway studies to define the emergent, systems-level principles that govern this fundamental state of cellular life.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research is founded on the central hypothesis that a conserved, core molecular program governs the entry into, maintenance of, and exit from the quiescent state across diverse eukaryotic species and cell types. We further hypothesize that this core program is modulated by context-specific regulatory layers that fine-tune the depth and reversibility of dormancy, explaining the functional heterogeneity observed in different biological systems. To systematically test this overarching hypothesis, we have structured our investigation into three specific aims, each with distinct research questions, testable hypotheses, and clear, predictable outcomes. \n\n**Aim 1: Identify a robust, cross-species molecular signature of the core quiescence program.**\nThis aim addresses the most fundamental gap in the field: the absence of a universal definition of quiescence. \n*   **Research Question 1.1:** What is the minimal, conserved set of genes, proteins, and epigenetic marks whose state consistently distinguishes quiescent cells from their proliferative counterparts across different species (e.g., yeast, mouse, human) and cell types (e.g., fibroblasts, stem cells, cancer cells)?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** We hypothesize that a conserved multi-omic signature exists, characterized by the coordinated upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors and stress-response factors, the downregulation of genes involved in DNA replication and biomass production, and specific, recurring patterns of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the regulatory regions of these core genes.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that a cross-dataset meta-analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data will reveal a statistically significant, common set of differentially expressed genes and proteins. We will validate the robustness of this signature by using it as a feature set to train a classifier that can accurately distinguish quiescent from proliferative cells in independent, held-out datasets not used in the discovery phase. The evolutionary conservation of the signature will be confirmed by analyzing orthologous genes across species.\n\n**Aim 2: Map the universal signaling pathways and metabolic networks associated with quiescence.**\nBeyond a simple list of molecules, we seek to understand the regulatory logic of the quiescent state.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** Which signaling pathways, transcriptional regulatory networks, and metabolic programs are universally rewired during the transition to and maintenance of quiescence?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** We hypothesize that the suppression of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and the activation of the AMPK pathway serve as central, conserved regulatory hubs that integrate diverse entry signals. We further hypothesize that this signaling shift orchestrates a universal metabolic reprogramming, characterized by a decrease in glycolysis and anaplerosis and an increase in catabolic processes like autophagy and fatty acid oxidation.\n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that pathway enrichment and network inference analyses performed on our integrated multi-omic data will consistently identify the mTOR, AMPK, and Hippo pathways as the most significantly perturbed. Our integrated model will predict specific regulatory connections (e.g., a transcription factor regulating a set of metabolic enzymes) that are conserved across datasets. We will validate these predictions by cross-referencing them with existing experimental data from perturbation studies (e.g., gene knockouts, drug treatments) available in the literature and public databases.\n\n**Aim 3: Build predictive models to distinguish quiescence depths and predict reactivation potential.**\nThis aim seeks to capture the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of dormancy.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can we leverage the integrated multi-omic data to develop a quantitative 'quiescence score' that reflects the depth of dormancy (e.g., distinguishing a G0-alert state from deep quiescence)?\n*   **Research Question 3.2:** Can molecular features from our integrated dataset predict the likelihood and kinetics of a cell's re-entry into the cell cycle upon stimulation?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** We hypothesize that quiescence depth is a continuous variable reflected by quantitative changes in the expression of the core signature genes, the degree of chromatin condensation at proliferative loci, and the extent of metabolic suppression. \n*   **Prediction & Validation:** We predict that a machine learning model trained on datasets with known quiescence depths (e.g., time-course experiments) will be able to accurately predict the dormancy state of cells from new datasets. The model's utility will be validated by testing its ability to predict experimentally measured reactivation potential in independent datasets, such as those from stem cell activation assays or cancer dormancy models. The ultimate deliverable will be a computational tool that can take new multi-omic data as input and output a predictive score of dormancy depth and reactivation capacity.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group, leveraging the unique expertise of its members in cell cycle biology, systems biology, and computational machine learning. Our approach is organized into four sequential but interconnected phases, designed to systematically collect, integrate, and analyze public data to address our central hypotheses. The collaborative framework is essential, as the scale and complexity of this synthesis project are beyond the capabilities of any single research lab, requiring the NCEMS working group model for success.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Curation, Harmonization, and Pipeline Development (Months 1-9)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on building a robust and reproducible computational infrastructure.\n*   **Data Sourcing:** We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, Sequence Read Archive (SRA), PRIDE, and MetaboLights. We will use keyword searches (e.g., 'quiescence', 'G0', 'dormancy', 'serum starvation', 'contact inhibition') and screen thousands of studies based on pre-defined inclusion criteria: 1) must contain a direct comparison between a quiescent and a proliferative control group; 2) must be from a specified set of data types (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, proteomics, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, metabolomics); 3) must have sufficient metadata to describe the biological context (species, cell type, quiescence induction method). \n*   **Harmonization Pipeline:** A key innovation of this project will be the development of a unified data processing and normalization pipeline, implemented using a workflow manager like Snakemake or Nextflow to ensure reproducibility. For each data type, raw data will be processed using community-standard best practices (e.g., STAR alignment and RSEM quantification for RNA-seq; MaxQuant for proteomics). A critical step will be the application of advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq) to mitigate non-biological variation arising from different labs, platforms, and protocols. This will create a harmonized data matrix, the core substrate for all subsequent analyses.\n*   **Data Integration Framework:** We will employ a multi-layered integration strategy. Initially, meta-analysis will be performed within each omics layer to identify robust signals. Subsequently, we will use multi-omic factor analysis tools, such as MOFA+ (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2), to uncover shared axes of variation across different data types. This will allow us to identify coordinated changes in transcripts, proteins, and chromatin states that define the quiescent state.\n\n**Phase 2: Identification and Analysis of the Core Quiescence Program (Months 10-18)**\nWith the integrated data in hand, we will address Aims 1 and 2.\n*   **Core Signature Discovery (Aim 1):** We will apply robust statistical meta-analysis methods (e.g., random-effects models, rank aggregation) to the harmonized data to identify a consensus list of differentially expressed genes/proteins. For epigenomic data, we will identify consensus differential peaks of accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone modification (ChIP-seq). We will then integrate these lists to define a high-confidence, multi-omic core signature of quiescence.\n*   **Network and Pathway Mapping (Aim 2):** The core signature will be used as input for pathway enrichment analysis (e.g., GSEA) and network biology tools (e.g., STRING, Cytoscape). We will construct a consensus quiescence regulatory network by integrating protein-protein interaction data, kinase-substrate predictions, and transcription factor-target information. This network model will visualize the key hubs and modules that govern the quiescent state.\n\n**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling of Quiescence Depth (Months 19-30)**\nThis phase will focus on Aim 3, translating our integrated data into predictive tools.\n*   **Feature Engineering and Model Training:** We will leverage datasets that include time-series or multiple, distinct quiescent states to define features associated with dormancy 'depth'. These features will include expression levels of core signature genes, pathway activity scores derived from the network model, and chromatin accessibility metrics. We will use these features to train a suite of supervised machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines) to predict a cell's position on the quiescence spectrum.\n*   **Model Validation and Interpretation:** Models will be rigorously validated using k-fold cross-validation and, most importantly, on completely independent test datasets not used for training. We will use model interpretation techniques (e.g., SHAP values) to identify the molecular features that are most predictive of quiescence depth and reactivation potential.\n\n**Phase 4: Dissemination via the Quiescence Atlas (Months 31-36)**\n*   **Atlas Development and Open Science:** The project will culminate in the creation of the 'Quiescence Atlas,' a publicly accessible web portal. This resource will allow users to explore the integrated data, visualize the core signature and network models, and use our predictive tools on their own data. All analysis code, workflows, and processed data will be made available through GitHub and Zenodo, adhering to FAIR principles and the open science mission of NCEMS.\n\n**Timeline & Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of the data harmonization pipeline; initial meta-analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data; first working group publication on the methodology.\n*   **Year 2:** Definition of the core multi-omic signature and consensus network model; development and internal validation of predictive models; presentations at international conferences.\n*   **Year 3:** External validation of predictive models; launch of the public beta version of the Quiescence Atlas; submission of primary research manuscripts to high-impact journals.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This community-scale synthesis project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will reshape our understanding of cellular quiescence and provide invaluable resources for the broader biomedical research community. The impact will span from fundamental biological insights to tangible applications in medicine and biotechnology, directly aligning with the goals of the NCEMS program.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\nThe primary outcome of this research will be a unified, systems-level framework for understanding cellular quiescence. This represents a paradigm shift from the current, fragmented view of dormancy. \n1.  **The First Universal Definition of Quiescence:** By identifying a robust, cross-species, multi-omic 'core quiescence program,' we will provide the field with a much-needed foundational definition. This signature will serve as a benchmark for future studies and resolve long-standing questions about the conservation of quiescence mechanisms from yeast to humans.\n2.  **A Comprehensive Regulatory Map:** Our consensus network model will illuminate the universal signaling pathways and transcriptional circuits that govern the quiescent state. This will move beyond a 'parts list' of genes to a mechanistic understanding of how cells integrate signals to make the decision to enter or exit the cell cycle.\n3.  **A Quantitative Framework for Dormancy:** The development of a predictive 'quiescence score' will be a major conceptual advance, reframing quiescence from a binary state to a quantifiable continuum. This will enable researchers to precisely characterize the depth of dormancy in their experimental systems, a critical parameter for studying stem cell function and cancer relapse.\n\n**The Quiescence Atlas: A Lasting Community Resource:**\nA major tangible outcome will be the 'Quiescence Atlas,' a publicly accessible web portal. This resource will democratize access to complex, integrated quiescence data. Analogous to landmark resources like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Quiescence Atlas will empower individual labs without extensive computational expertise to explore the molecular landscape of quiescence, query their genes of interest, and generate novel, data-driven hypotheses. This directly addresses the NCEMS goal of developing innovative research strategies and resources for the community.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe fundamental knowledge generated will have significant translational potential.\n*   **Oncology:** Dormant, quiescent cancer cells are a major cause of therapeutic resistance and metastatic relapse. Our core signature could yield biomarkers to detect these elusive cells, and our network model could reveal novel therapeutic targets to either eradicate them or lock them in a permanently dormant state.\n*   **Regenerative Medicine:** The ability to control the quiescence-to-proliferation transition is the holy grail of stem cell therapy. Our predictive models could help optimize protocols for activating stem cells for tissue repair or, conversely, for maintaining their long-term potency in culture.\n*   **Aging Research:** The age-related decline in tissue function is linked to the exhaustion of stem cell pools and the accumulation of senescent cells. By providing a deep understanding of quiescence, our work will inform strategies to preserve regenerative capacity and promote healthy aging.\n\n**Training and Collaboration:**\nThis project is an ideal vehicle for training the next generation of data-savvy biologists. Trainees will gain hands-on experience in big data synthesis, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and open science practices. The working group structure will foster a collaborative network that will persist beyond the funding period, seeding future projects and partnerships. We will develop and disseminate training materials and workshops based on our analysis pipelines, amplifying our impact on workforce development. \n\n**Dissemination Strategy:**\nOur findings will be disseminated broadly through high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at major international conferences, and, most importantly, through the continuous development and promotion of the Quiescence Atlas. All code and data will be shared openly, ensuring our work is transparent, reproducible, and a building block for future research. This project will not only answer a fundamental question in cell biology but will also catalyze a new, community-oriented way of studying this critical cellular state.",

        "background_and_significance": "The completion of the Human Genome Project ushered in a new era of biology, yet a fundamental challenge remains: assigning a function to every protein it encodes. Despite decades of research, a significant portion of the human proteome, estimated to be between 20-30% depending on annotation standards, consists of Proteins of Unknown Function (PUFs), often referred to as the 'dark proteome'. This knowledge gap represents a major barrier to a complete understanding of human health and disease. These uncharacterized proteins are not merely esoteric entities; many are evolutionarily conserved and have been linked through genetic studies to various diseases, yet their molecular roles remain enigmatic. Closing this gap is therefore a critical and timely endeavor for the molecular and cellular sciences.\n\nCurrent computational approaches to protein function prediction have laid important groundwork but suffer from significant limitations. Historically, function annotation has relied heavily on sequence homology, using tools like BLAST to transfer annotations from well-characterized proteins to their relatives. While effective for proteins with close homologs, this approach fails for evolutionarily divergent proteins or those belonging to novel families. The advent of high-throughput experimental techniques has generated a wealth of diverse data types, each offering a different perspective on protein function. Network-based methods leverage large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps from resources like BioGRID and STRING, operating on the 'guilt-by-association' principle: proteins that interact physically are likely to be involved in the same biological process. Similarly, transcriptomic data from projects like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the Human Cell Atlas allow for the construction of co-expression networks, where genes with correlated expression patterns are inferred to be functionally linked. Genomic context methods, such as phylogenetic profiling, identify proteins that co-evolve across species, suggesting a functional constraint that maintains their co-occurrence. More recently, large-scale functional genomics screens, such as the DepMap project, provide phenotypic profiles based on gene essentiality across hundreds of cancer cell lines, enabling the clustering of genes with similar functional consequences.\n\nA revolutionary advance has been the development of highly accurate protein structure prediction by AlphaFold, which has provided high-quality structural models for nearly the entire human proteome. Structure is a stronger correlate of function than sequence, and comparing 3D structures can reveal distant evolutionary relationships and functional sites (e.g., active sites, binding pockets) that are invisible at the sequence level. Tools like FoldSeek are now making proteome-scale structural comparisons feasible.\n\nThe key limitation of the current landscape is the siloed nature of these data and the methods used to analyze them. Most existing prediction tools are uni-modal, relying on a single data type. This not only limits their predictive power but can also introduce systematic biases inherent to the source data. While some integrative methods exist, they often combine only two or three data types, lack a rigorous statistical foundation for weighing evidence, or have not been applied systematically to the entire 'dark proteome'. The sheer scale and heterogeneity of publicly available data present a formidable integration challenge that is beyond the scope of a typical research lab.\n\nThis project is critically important and timely because we have reached a unique inflection point. For the first time, we possess both the comprehensive, multi-modal public datasets and the computational and methodological sophistication required to tackle the PUF problem at a community scale. The availability of the AlphaFold database, in particular, provides a structural scaffold that can anchor and contextualize evidence from all other modalities. By creating a transdisciplinary working group of bioinformaticians, structural biologists, network scientists, and machine learning experts, we can develop a principled Bayesian framework to synthesize these disparate data streams. Such an effort will not only generate a wealth of novel, testable hypotheses about fundamental cellular processes but will also create an invaluable public resource to accelerate biomedical research worldwide.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to systematically elucidate the functions of uncharacterized human proteins (PUFs) by developing and applying a novel, multi-modal inference engine. This endeavor is guided by a set of core research questions and testable hypotheses designed to rigorously assess the power of data synthesis and generate high-confidence biological discoveries.\n\n**Primary Research Questions:**\n\n**RQ1: Can the probabilistic integration of diverse, orthogonal data modalities generate functional annotations for PUFs that are significantly more accurate, comprehensive, and confident than predictions from any single data type?** This question addresses the central premise of data synthesis. We will investigate whether combining evidence from protein structure, physical interactions, gene co-expression, phylogenetic conservation, and functional genomics screens provides a synergistic effect, overcoming the inherent noise and biases of individual datasets.\n\n**RQ2: What is the optimal statistical framework for weighing the contributions of different data modalities to maximize predictive power?** Not all evidence is equal. We will explore the extent to which different data types provide orthogonal versus redundant information. For instance, are PPI and co-expression data highly correlated, or do they capture distinct aspects of a protein's functional context? Our goal is to develop a Bayesian model that learns the relative predictive value of each modality, potentially in a context-dependent manner (e.g., structural data may be more informative for enzymes, while interaction data is more informative for scaffold proteins).\n\n**RQ3: Can the systematic annotation of PUFs, placed within the context of known cellular networks, reveal novel protein complexes, functional modules, and previously unappreciated biological pathways?** Beyond annotating individual proteins, a key goal is to understand how PUFs fit into the larger cellular machinery. We will investigate whether our integrated functional linkage network, which connects proteins based on multi-modal evidence, can be partitioned to uncover new cellular components and pathways enriched with newly characterized PUFs.\n\n**RQ4: How can AlphaFold-predicted structures be most effectively leveraged in a multi-modal framework to identify distant homologies and functional sites in PUFs that are undetectable by sequence-based methods?** We will explore whether combining structural similarity with network context (e.g., interaction partners, co-expressed genes) can disambiguate the function of proteins with common folds (e.g., TIM barrels) or pinpoint the specific biological process for a PUF that has structural similarity to a multi-functional protein family.\n\n**Testable Hypotheses and Validation Strategies:**\n\n**H1: A multi-modal Bayesian integration framework will achieve significantly higher performance in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms for proteins compared to state-of-the-art, single-modality prediction methods.**\n*   **Prediction:** Our integrated model will demonstrate superior precision, recall, and F1-scores in a rigorous cross-validation benchmark against methods based solely on sequence homology (e.g., BLAST2GO), network topology (e.g., STRING), or structural similarity (e.g., FoldSeek).\n*   **Validation:** We will employ a stringent validation protocol. First, we will use k-fold cross-validation on a 'gold standard' set of well-annotated proteins. More importantly, we will perform a time-split validation, training our model on annotations available up to a specific date (e.g., Jan 2022) and testing its ability to predict new annotations that have been experimentally validated and added to GO since then. This simulates true prospective prediction and provides a robust, unbiased measure of performance.\n\n**H2: Integrating structural similarity networks with PPI and co-expression networks will reveal novel, functionally coherent protein modules that include one or more PUFs.**\n*   **Prediction:** Applying community detection algorithms to our integrated, multi-layer network will identify clusters of proteins that are functionally enriched for specific biological processes (e.g., 'mRNA splicing'). We predict that many of these clusters will contain PUFs, whose membership in the cluster constitutes a high-confidence functional hypothesis.\n*   **Validation:** The functional coherence of predicted modules will be statistically assessed using GO term enrichment analysis. For high-confidence predictions, we will perform in-depth literature searches for emerging, independent evidence that supports our functional assignment. The most compelling hypotheses will be presented to the community as prime candidates for experimental validation.\n\n**H3: PUFs that exhibit strong evidence scores linking them to known disease-associated pathways are likely to be novel disease-implicated genes.**\n*   **Prediction:** Our engine will identify PUFs whose integrated evidence profile (e.g., co-expression with cancer genes in tumor samples, physical interaction with proteins mutated in a specific disorder, and essentiality profiles similar to known drug targets) strongly connects them to specific disease pathways.\n*   **Validation:** We will cross-reference our list of disease-implicated PUFs with independent genetic data from GWAS catalogs and clinical variant databases (e.g., ClinVar). The discovery of statistically significant disease-associated variants within the genes of our predicted PUFs will serve as powerful, independent validation of our functional hypotheses.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a community-scale synthesis effort that requires a transdisciplinary working group and a phased, systematic approach to data integration, model development, and dissemination. The project will be executed over three years, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.\n\n**Working Group and Organization:**\nThe working group comprises three collaborating labs with complementary expertise: a bioinformatics and machine learning lab (PI 1) to lead the development of the Bayesian framework; a structural biology and proteomics lab (PI 2) to lead the processing and analysis of structural and interaction data; and a network and systems biology lab (PI 3) to lead the integration of network-based evidence and module discovery. The team will include two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students who will receive cross-disciplinary training. The group will operate under open science principles, with bi-weekly virtual meetings, two in-person workshops per year, and a shared project management platform (e.g., Slack, Asana). All code and analysis pipelines will be developed collaboratively in a version-controlled public GitHub repository.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Standardization, and Feature Engineering (Months 1-9)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on assembling and processing the diverse public datasets. All data will be mapped to stable Ensembl and UniProt identifiers to ensure interoperability.\n*   **Proteome Definition:** We will define the set of ~20,300 canonical human proteins from UniProt/Swiss-Prot and identify the target set of PUFs based on neXtProt evidence levels (PE2, PE3, PE4) and the absence of curated functional GO terms.\n*   **Structural Data:** We will download all human protein structures from the AlphaFold Database. An all-vs-all structural similarity matrix will be computed using FoldSeek, providing a quantitative measure of structural relatedness for every protein pair. Structural domains will be annotated using InterProScan.\n*   **Interaction Data:** Physical protein-protein interaction data will be aggregated from major databases including BioGRID, IntAct, and HuRI. Data will be filtered to retain only high-confidence interactions supported by multiple experiments or low-throughput methods, creating a unified PPI network.\n*   **Co-expression Data:** We will process bulk RNA-seq data from the GTEx v8 release across 54 tissues and single-cell RNA-seq data from the Human Cell Atlas. For each context, we will compute a pairwise gene co-expression matrix using a robust correlation measure (e.g., Spearman's rank correlation).\n*   **Phylogenetic Data:** We will generate phylogenetic profiles for every human protein by determining their presence or absence across a curated set of over 1,000 diverse species from the OrthoDB database. These binary vectors will be used to compute co-evolution scores for all protein pairs.\n*   **Phenotypic Data:** Gene dependency scores from genome-wide CRISPR screens across ~1,000 cancer cell lines will be obtained from the DepMap portal. A phenotypic similarity score for each gene pair will be calculated based on the correlation of their dependency profiles.\n*   **Gold Standard:** A 'gold standard' for training and validation will be constructed from the Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway databases, restricted to annotations with experimental or curated evidence codes (i.e., excluding IEA - Inferred from Electronic Annotation).\n\n**Phase 2: Model Development and Validation (Months 10-21)**\nThis phase focuses on building and testing the core inference engine.\n*   **Bayesian Integration Framework:** We will develop a Naive Bayes classifier, a well-established and interpretable framework for data integration. The model aims to calculate the posterior probability that two proteins, A and B, share a function (F) given the evidence from multiple data sources (D1, D2, ... Dn): P(F | D1...Dn). The model will be trained using our gold standard, where positive examples are protein pairs that share a specific GO term, and negative examples are pairs that do not. During training, the model will learn the likelihood distributions P(Di | F) for each data source, effectively learning the evidentiary weight of a given structural similarity score, co-expression value, etc.\n*   **Model Training and Optimization:** The model will be trained on a subset of well-characterized proteins. We will optimize hyperparameters and feature representations using k-fold cross-validation. We will explicitly model data-source-specific biases and correlations to improve robustness.\n*   **Inference and Annotation Transfer:** Once trained, the model will be applied to every pair of proteins involving at least one PUF. For each PUF, this will produce a ranked list of functionally related proteins. We will then use a network-based label propagation algorithm to transfer GO terms from these high-confidence neighbors to the PUF, generating a ranked list of probabilistic functional annotations.\n*   **Validation:** The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated using the time-split validation strategy described in H1, providing an unbiased estimate of its predictive power on novel discoveries.\n\n**Phase 3: Network Analysis, Dissemination, and Resource Deployment (Months 22-36)**\n*   **Integrated Network Analysis:** We will construct a multi-layer network where nodes are proteins and edge weights are the posterior probabilities of functional linkage from our Bayesian model. We will apply the Leiden community detection algorithm to this network to identify novel functional modules (as per H2).\n*   **Web Portal Development:** A major deliverable is a public, interactive web portal. Users will be able to search for any human protein, view its predicted functions with associated confidence scores, and explore the underlying evidence from each data modality through interactive network visualizations. All data and results will be fully downloadable.\n*   **Dissemination:** Findings will be published in open-access journals and presented at international conferences. We will host webinars and create tutorials to train the community on using the portal and our open-source pipeline, which will be containerized using Docker and described with a Nextflow workflow for full reproducibility.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will produce a suite of tangible outcomes that will have a significant and lasting impact on the molecular and cellular biosciences, directly addressing the core goals of the NCEMS research call.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\n1.  **A Comprehensive, Probabilistic Functional Annotation of the Human 'Dark Proteome':** The primary outcome will be a database of high-confidence functional predictions for thousands of currently uncharacterized human proteins. Unlike existing resources that provide disparate or binary information, our annotations will be probabilistic, providing users with a quantitative measure of confidence for each prediction and detailing the contribution of each evidence type. We anticipate generating high-confidence (posterior probability > 0.75) hypotheses for at least 200-300 PUFs, and informative predictions for over a thousand more.\n\n2.  **A Novel, Open-Source Multi-Modal Integration Framework:** We will deliver a robust, well-documented, and open-source computational pipeline for Bayesian data integration. This framework will be a significant methodological contribution, providing a template for researchers seeking to synthesize heterogeneous data types. Its modular design will allow other groups to adapt it for different organisms or to incorporate new data modalities as they become available.\n\n3.  **A Publicly Accessible, Interactive Web Resource:** We will create and deploy the 'Human PUF Annotation Portal,' a dynamic web server that will become a go-to resource for the cell biology community. This portal will serve as the primary vehicle for disseminating our results, allowing any researcher to easily query their protein of interest and visualize the network of evidence supporting its functional annotation. This resource will lower the activation energy for investigating PUFs, empowering individual labs to pursue new research directions.\n\n4.  **Discovery of Novel Biological Pathways and Protein Complexes:** Through our integrated network analysis, we expect to identify dozens of novel functional modules and propose new components for well-established cellular machinery. These discoveries, such as identifying a novel kinase in a signaling pathway or a new component of a DNA repair complex, will open up entirely new fields of biological inquiry.\n\n**Broader Impact and Applications:**\n\n*   **Accelerating the Pace of Biomedical Discovery:** This project will act as a catalyst for hypothesis-driven experimental research. By providing specific, testable hypotheses, we will enable experimental biologists to move directly to functional validation, saving years of preliminary work. A cancer researcher, for example, could use our portal to identify a novel PUF co-expressed with their oncogene of interest, immediately suggesting a new target for investigation. This will have a multiplicative effect on discovery across countless areas of human biology.\n\n*   **Illuminating Disease Mechanisms and Identifying New Drug Targets:** Many PUFs are implicated in human disease through genome-wide association studies, but their lack of functional annotation has made them difficult to study. Our work will provide the crucial link between genetic association and molecular function. By identifying the enzymatic or signaling roles of these disease-associated PUFs, we will uncover novel mechanisms of pathology and highlight a vast, untapped space of potential therapeutic targets.\n\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Data Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment that directly aligns with the NCEMS mission to develop a data-savvy workforce. Trainees will gain invaluable hands-on experience at the intersection of machine learning, network biology, structural bioinformatics, and open-source software development. They will learn to manage large-scale data, work in a collaborative team-science environment, and communicate complex results to a broad audience, skills that are in high demand in both academia and industry.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Sustainability:**\nOur commitment to open science principles ensures maximum impact and longevity. All publications will be open-access. All code, data, and analysis workflows will be publicly available in repositories like GitHub and Zenodo. The web portal will be designed for long-term sustainability, hosted on stable cloud infrastructure. We will seek follow-on funding through NIH resource grants (R24) to support ongoing maintenance and periodic updates of the portal with new data, ensuring it remains a valuable and current community resource for years to come.",
        "budget_and_resources": "The proposed research represents a large-scale, community-level synthesis project that is beyond the capabilities of a single research laboratory or existing collaboration.

        "background_and_significance": "The compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells into membrane-bound organelles is a foundational concept in biology. However, recent discoveries have revealed an equally important mode of organization: the formation of membrane-less organelles, or biomolecular condensates, through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). These dynamic, protein- and RNA-rich assemblies, such as nucleoli, stress granules, and P-bodies, concentrate specific molecules to regulate a vast array of cellular processes, including transcription, RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and DNA repair. The physical principle underlying their formation is the ability of certain multivalent macromolecules to undergo phase separation, demixing from the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to form a distinct liquid phase. This emergent phenomenon represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular spatiotemporal organization. The field has rapidly advanced from initial observations to identifying key molecular drivers of LLPS. Seminal work has established that proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low-complexity domains (LCDs) are major drivers of phase separation. These regions lack stable tertiary structure and engage in a network of weak, transient, and multivalent interactions—such as cation-pi, pi-pi, and electrostatic interactions—that collectively drive condensate assembly. Several computational tools have been developed to predict LLPS propensity from protein sequences, leveraging features like amino acid composition, charge patterning, and predicted disorder (e.g., PScore, catGRANULE). While valuable, these first-generation predictors are often trained on limited datasets and primarily focus on sequence, neglecting other critical factors. Beyond sequence, post-translational modifications (PTMs) have emerged as a crucial regulatory layer. Phosphorylation, for instance, can dissolve condensates by introducing negative charges that disrupt electrostatic interactions, as seen with FUS and TDP-43, or promote assembly by creating new interaction motifs. Similarly, ubiquitination and acetylation can profoundly modulate the phase behavior of proteins. Furthermore, the composition of condensates is not static; it is a complex interplay between 'scaffold' proteins that drive phase separation and 'client' proteins that are recruited. Understanding this compositional logic is essential for deciphering condensate function. Despite this progress, significant gaps in our knowledge remain, presenting a formidable challenge that is perfectly suited for a community-scale data synthesis approach. First, we lack a unified, predictive 'grammar' for LLPS. Current knowledge is fragmented, and we cannot reliably predict, from its features alone, whether a given protein will phase separate, what its partners will be, and how its behavior will be regulated under different cellular conditions. Second, existing predictive models are limited in scope and accuracy because they fail to integrate the full spectrum of relevant biological data. Information on protein structure (from PDB and the revolutionary AlphaFold Database), PTMs (from PhosphoSitePlus), protein-protein interactions (from BioGRID), and subcellular localization (from the Human Protein Atlas and Image Data Resource) is publicly available but resides in disparate silos. No single research lab possesses the diverse expertise—in biophysics, cell biology, and data science—required to effectively mine, integrate, and synthesize these vast datasets. This project is both important and timely because the confluence of massive public data availability and advances in machine learning creates an unprecedented opportunity to address these fundamental questions. A comprehensive, predictive model of the cellular 'condensatome' would not only provide profound insights into the principles of cellular organization but also have significant biomedical implications. The dysregulation of biomolecular condensates is increasingly linked to a range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, as well as various cancers. By building a tool to generate testable hypotheses about condensate composition and regulation, this work will empower the broader scientific community to investigate the roles of LLPS in health and disease.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is organized around three central aims, each designed to deconstruct the complex 'grammar' of biomolecular condensates. By systematically integrating diverse public data, we will move beyond simple sequence-based prediction to build a multi-faceted, systems-level model of the cellular condensatome. Our approach is hypothesis-driven, with each prediction and model component subject to rigorous computational validation against orthogonal datasets and known biological ground truths. \n\n**Aim 1: To develop a comprehensive, multi-modal model for predicting a protein's intrinsic propensity to undergo LLPS.**\nThis aim addresses the fundamental question of which proteins in the proteome can phase separate. While current tools exist, they are limited by their reliance on primary sequence. We seek to create a next-generation predictor that incorporates a richer feature set.\n*   **Research Question 1.1:** Can the integration of protein sequence, structure, and evolutionary conservation features significantly improve the accuracy and generalizability of LLPS propensity prediction?\n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** A machine learning model trained on a synthesized feature set—encompassing sequence-derived properties (IDR length, amino acid composition, charge patterning), structural information (domain architecture, solvent accessibility from PDB/AlphaFold), and evolutionary data (conservation scores)—will exhibit superior performance (higher AUC-ROC and AUPRC) compared to existing state-of-the-art predictors when evaluated on a held-out, independent test set of experimentally validated proteins.\n*   **Validation:** We will curate a gold-standard dataset from resources like PhaSepDB and DrLLPS. The model's performance will be rigorously benchmarked against at least three leading predictors using cross-validation and independent testing. We will also assess its ability to correctly classify proteins whose LLPS behavior is context-dependent, a known weakness of current tools.\n\n**Aim 2: To predict the composition of specific biomolecular condensates by identifying scaffold-client relationships.**\nA protein's LLPS behavior is not an isolated property; it occurs within a crowded cellular environment. This aim focuses on predicting the interaction partners that constitute a functional condensate.\n*   **Research Question 2.1:** How can we leverage systems-level data, including protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, co-expression profiles, and co-localization imaging data, to predict the core (scaffold) and recruited (client) components of specific condensates?\n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** A network-based algorithm that integrates evidence from physical PPIs (BioGRID, STRING), functional associations (co-expression from GTEx), and spatial proximity (co-localization from the Image Data Resource) can accurately predict the composition of well-characterized condensates. We predict that true condensate members will form densely connected modules within this integrated network, distinguishable from random interactors.\n*   **Validation:** We will test this hypothesis by applying our model to known scaffold proteins (e.g., G3BP1 for stress granules, NOP58 for the nucleolus). The model's ranked predictions of interaction partners will be statistically validated against experimentally determined proteomes of these specific condensates, using enrichment analyses (e.g., hypergeometric tests) to quantify the overlap.\n\n**Aim 3: To model the regulatory role of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on condensate dynamics.**\nCondensates are not static; they assemble and disassemble in response to cellular signals, often mediated by PTMs. This aim seeks to identify the specific PTMs that act as molecular switches.\n*   **Research Question 3.1:** Can we identify sequence and structural features that distinguish PTMs that regulate LLPS from those that do not, thereby allowing us to predict regulatory 'hotspots'?\n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** PTMs that functionally modulate LLPS are non-randomly located in regions that directly impact the driving forces of phase separation. We hypothesize that a predictive model will identify features such as location within an IDR, proximity to key aromatic or charged residues, and the potential to alter local charge or steric hindrance as key determinants of a PTM's regulatory capacity.\n*   **Validation:** We will compile a training set of PTMs with experimentally documented effects on LLPS from the literature and PhosphoSitePlus. Our classifier will be trained to distinguish these from other PTMs on the same proteins. The model's predictive power will be validated by its ability to rediscover known regulatory sites and by performing a literature-based validation of its novel, high-confidence predictions. For example, we will search for evidence that our predicted regulatory PTMs on a protein are linked to changes in its subcellular localization or function consistent with altered phase behavior. \n\n**Expected Deliverables:** The culmination of these aims will be a publicly accessible, integrated computational platform—the 'Condensatome Atlas'—providing predictions of LLPS propensity, condensate composition, and PTM-based regulation for any protein of interest. This will serve as a powerful hypothesis-generation tool for the entire molecular and cellular biology community.",

The project will proceed through four major phases, with clear milestones and deliverables.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Integration (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase addresses the critical challenge of synthesizing heterogeneous public data into a unified, queryable resource. This task is beyond the scope of a single lab and requires the dedicated effort of our working group.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically download and process data from a curated list of public repositories. These include: (1) **Sequence & Intrinsic Features:** UniProt, DisProt, MobiDB; (2) **Structural Features:** Protein Data Bank (PDB), AlphaFold DB (v4); (3) **Post-Translational Modifications:** PhosphoSitePlus, dbPTM; (4) **Interaction & Functional Networks:** BioGRID, STRING, IntAct, and co-expression data from GTEx; (5) **Localization Data:** Human Protein Atlas, Image Data Resource (IDR); (6) **Ground-Truth LLPS Data:** PhaSepDB, DrLLPS, LLPSDB, supplemented by manual literature curation.\n*   **Data Integration Pipeline:** We will develop a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to harmonize these datasets. All proteins will be mapped to stable UniProt identifiers. Data will be structured and stored in a PostgreSQL relational database, allowing for complex queries that link, for example, a specific PTM site to its structural context and known interaction partners. This integrated database is a key deliverable and a prerequisite for all subsequent modeling.\n\n**Phase 2: Predictive Modeling of LLPS Propensity (Aim 1; Months 7-15)**\n*   **Feature Engineering:** For each protein in the human proteome, we will generate a rich feature vector (~500 features) including: sequence composition (k-mers, amino acid indices), physicochemical properties (charge, hydropathy, aromaticity), disorder predictions (multiple algorithms), structural parameters derived from AlphaFold models (secondary structure content, solvent accessibility, pLDDT scores), and domain annotations (InterPro).\n*   **Model Development and Training:** We will employ a gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) for our primary model due to its high performance and interpretability. We will train the model on our curated set of ~2,500 experimentally validated positive and negative examples. Model training will involve rigorous hyperparameter optimization using 10-fold cross-validation. To capture more complex relationships, we will also explore Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures that can naturally incorporate structural and PPI data.\n*   **Model Interpretation:** We will use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze the trained XGBoost model. This will allow us to move beyond a 'black box' prediction and identify the specific combinations of features that drive LLPS, providing insights into the molecular grammar.\n\n**Phase 3: Network-Based Prediction of Condensate Composition (Aim 2; Months 16-24)**\n*   **Multi-Layer Network Construction:** We will build a weighted, integrated human protein network. Edge weights between two proteins will be a learned function of multiple evidence channels: physical interaction scores from STRING, co-expression correlation across GTEx tissues, and co-localization scores derived from Human Protein Atlas annotations.\n*   **Composition Prediction Algorithm:** Using the LLPS propensity scores from Aim 1 to identify high-confidence 'scaffold' proteins, we will implement a network propagation algorithm (e.g., random walk with restart). The algorithm will propagate 'signal' from a known scaffold through the network, with the final scores on other nodes representing their predicted likelihood of being a client in that scaffold's condensate. The model will be trained and validated using known compositions of condensates like stress granules and P-bodies.\n\n**Phase 4: Modeling PTM Regulation and Platform Deployment (Aim 3 & Final Deliverable; Months 25-36)**\n*   **PTM Regulatory Model:** For each PTM site in PhosphoSitePlus, we will generate features describing its local environment: sequence context (±10 residues), structural context (secondary structure, accessibility), and proximity to IDRs and functional domains. A logistic regression or shallow neural network will be trained to classify PTMs with known regulatory effects on LLPS.\n*   **Timeline and Milestones:**\n    *   M6: Completion of integrated database.\n    *   M12: First version of LLPS propensity predictor (LLPS-Pro) benchmarked and internally validated.\n    *   M18: Manuscript on LLPS-Pro submitted. Development of network integration method initiated.\n    *   M24: Condensate composition predictor validated against known proteomes.\n    *   M30: PTM regulatory model developed. Work begins on web portal integration.\n    *   M36: Public launch of the 'Condensatome Atlas' web portal. Final project manuscript submitted.\n*   **Open Science:** All code will be developed in a public GitHub repository with version control. All curated datasets and final trained models will be deposited on Zenodo. This ensures full reproducibility and community access, aligning with the core principles of this research call.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to produce transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology. By synthesizing a vast and diverse array of public data, we will create not just new knowledge, but also powerful new tools and resources that will catalyze research across the community. Our impact will be felt through direct scientific contributions, broader applications in medicine and technology, and the training of a new generation of data-savvy biologists.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **The 'Condensatome Atlas': A Definitive Community Resource.** The primary outcome will be a comprehensive, publicly accessible web portal that provides a multi-layered view of the cellular condensatome. For any protein of interest, users will be able to retrieve its predicted LLPS propensity, a ranked list of potential interaction partners within condensates, and a map of PTMs predicted to regulate its phase behavior. This will be an invaluable hypothesis-generation tool, enabling experimentalists to design more targeted and informed studies. Unlike static databases, our atlas will be a dynamic platform with a clear framework for future updates.\n2.  **A New Standard for Predictive Modeling.** Our work will establish a new paradigm for predicting emergent cellular behaviors. By demonstrating the power of integrating sequence, structure, interaction, and regulatory data, we will move the field beyond simplistic, single-modality models. The methodologies we develop for data integration and machine learning will be broadly applicable to other complex biological questions.\n3.  **Fundamental Insights into the 'Grammar' of LLPS.** Through interpretable machine learning, we will dissect the complex interplay of molecular features that govern phase separation. We expect to uncover novel sequence motifs, structural arrangements, and regulatory patterns that constitute the 'grammar' of LLPS. This will provide fundamental knowledge about how cells use phase separation to organize their interior and regulate their functions, addressing a long-standing puzzle in cell biology.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Therapeutic Hypothesis Generation:** The dysregulation of biomolecular condensates is a pathogenic mechanism in numerous diseases, including neurodegeneration (e.g., ALS, Alzheimer's) and cancer. Our Condensatome Atlas will allow researchers to investigate the impact of disease-associated mutations on LLPS propensity or predict how oncogenic signaling pathways might alter condensate composition through PTMs. This will open new avenues for identifying therapeutic targets and developing novel treatment strategies.\n*   **Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering:** A quantitative understanding of the rules governing LLPS will empower the rational design of synthetic proteins and cells. This knowledge can be harnessed to create novel biomaterials, engineer artificial organelles for metabolic engineering, or develop new drug delivery systems based on phase-separating peptides.\n\n**Follow-up Research and Collaborations:**\nThis synthesis project is inherently collaborative and designed to spark new research directions. The predictions generated by our models will serve as a rich source of testable hypotheses for the experimental community. We will actively disseminate our high-confidence predictions and seek collaborations with experimental labs to validate them using techniques such as in vitro reconstitution, cellular imaging, and proteomics. The working group itself will form a lasting collaborative hub, ideally positioned to pursue new funding for experimental validation of our most exciting findings.\n\n**Dissemination and Training:**\nWe are committed to open science and broad dissemination. Our findings will be published in high-impact, open-access journals. All code, data, and models will be made publicly available. The Condensatome Atlas web portal will be our primary vehicle for sharing our results with the broadest possible audience. Furthermore, in line with the research call's mission, this project provides an exceptional training environment. The postdoctoral fellow and graduate student will gain rare, cross-disciplinary expertise in computational biology, data science, and cell biology, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-savvy workforce. We will also develop and share training materials and host workshops at national meetings to enable other researchers to use our tools and adopt our data synthesis approaches.",

        "background_and_significance": "The origin of the eukaryotic cell, a watershed event in the history of life, marks the transition from simple prokaryotic life to organisms of vastly greater structural and regulatory complexity. This transition, which occurred over a billion years ago, laid the foundation for the evolution of all multicellular life, including plants, animals, and fungi. While the endosymbiotic origin of the mitochondrion is well-established, the identity of the host cell and the sequence of events that led to the emergence of defining eukaryotic features—such as the nucleus, a dynamic cytoskeleton, and an intricate endomembrane system—remain central, unresolved questions in biology. For decades, our understanding of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) was based on extrapolations from a few model organisms. However, the recent explosion in genome sequencing, particularly from diverse microbial eukaryotes (protists) and the discovery of the Asgard archaea as the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, has revolutionized the field. Comparative genomic studies have successfully reconstructed a substantial portion of the LECA proteome, revealing that it was already a remarkably complex cell, possessing thousands of proteins involved in sophisticated cellular processes. Key studies have established that LECA likely contained core machinery for membrane trafficking (e.g., ESCRT complexes), ubiquitin-based signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and a primitive nuclear pore complex. This has provided us with a detailed 'parts list' of the ancestral eukaryotic cell. However, a parts list is not a blueprint. The critical gap in our knowledge is understanding how these components worked together. We lack a systems-level view of the ancestral cell's functional organization. The protein-protein interaction network, or interactome, represents the 'wiring diagram' that dictates cellular function. While interactomes have been mapped for several modern model organisms like yeast and humans, these represent endpoints of over a billion years of evolution. Extrapolating backwards from these modern networks is fraught with difficulty due to extensive divergence, gene loss, and lineage-specific adaptations. Previous attempts to study interactome evolution have been limited, often comparing only a few species or focusing on small, well-conserved protein complexes. There has been no systematic, large-scale effort to reconstruct an ancestral interactome from the ground up by synthesizing the full breadth of available genomic, proteomic, and structural data. This project is both important and timely because we are at a unique confluence of data availability and methodological advancement. The proliferation of publicly available genomes from previously unsampled eukaryotic lineages (e.g., via the EukProt database) and Asgard archaea provides the necessary phylogenetic breadth and a crucial prokaryotic outgroup. The maturation of large-scale experimental PPI datasets (e.g., BioGRID, IntAct) provides the raw material for inferring ancestral connections. Furthermore, revolutionary advances in computational methods, such as accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold and sophisticated algorithms for detecting co-evolution, now make it possible to infer and validate ancestral interactions with unprecedented confidence. By synthesizing these disparate data types, this project will move beyond the LECA 'parts list' to construct its 'wiring diagram'. This will provide a foundational model of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, enabling us to address fundamental questions about the emergence of its defining features and the principles governing the evolution of cellular complexity.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project addresses the overarching question: How did the architecture of the protein-protein interaction network evolve during the origin of the eukaryotic cell to generate a new level of cellular complexity? To tackle this, we have formulated three specific, interconnected research aims, each with testable hypotheses and clear, predictable outcomes. \n\n**Aim 1: Reconstruct the high-confidence protein-protein interactome of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA).** This aim moves beyond identifying the genes present in LECA to determining how their protein products functioned together. \n*   **Research Question 1.1:** What was the global topology—the size, density, and modularity—of the LECA interactome? \n*   **Hypothesis 1.1:** The LECA interactome was significantly larger and more densely connected than that of its prokaryotic progenitors, reflecting a quantum leap in functional integration. We hypothesize that this network was organized into distinct modules corresponding to nascent eukaryotic organelles and systems. \n*   **Prediction 1.1:** Our reconstructed LECA network will exhibit a power-law degree distribution characteristic of modern biological networks but will have a higher average clustering coefficient and a more modular structure than a similarly reconstructed Asgard archaeal interactome. We will identify distinct network communities enriched for proteins associated with functions like nuclear transport, endomembrane trafficking, and chromatin modification. \n\n**Aim 2: Identify the key network innovations that distinguish the LECA interactome from its prokaryotic antecedents.** This aim seeks to pinpoint the specific changes in the cellular 'wiring diagram' that drove the emergence of eukaryotic complexity. \n*   **Research Question 2.1:** Which protein interactions and network motifs were novel to LECA, and how were pre-existing prokaryotic proteins rewired into new eukaryotic-specific pathways? \n*   **Hypothesis 2.1:** Eukaryogenesis was driven by a dual process: the 'invention' of new hub proteins that organized novel cellular machinery, and the 'co-option' of conserved prokaryotic proteins into new interaction contexts. \n*   **Prediction 2.1:** A differential network analysis comparing the LECA and Asgard interactomes will reveal a cohort of LECA-specific proteins (e.g., early nucleoporins, ESCRT components, ubiquitin ligases) that act as high-connectivity hubs. Furthermore, we predict that conserved proteins with prokaryotic orthologs (e.g., actin, tubulin, ESCRT-III homologs) will show a significant gain of new interaction partners in the LECA network, linking them to eukaryotic-specific functions. \n\n**Aim 3: Model the ancestral interaction networks of key eukaryotic innovations.** We will focus on three systems central to the eukaryotic identity: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and the endomembrane system. \n*   **Research Question 3.1:** How did the components of these systems assemble into coherent, functional interaction modules in LECA? \n*   **Hypothesis 3.1:** The ancestral UPS emerged as a master regulatory network by forming connections to a wide array of substrates in pre-existing pathways. The ancestral NPC and endomembrane system formed as physically and functionally integrated modules through a dense web of newly evolved interactions. \n*   **Prediction 3.1:** The reconstructed ubiquitin-centric subnetwork in LECA will connect ubiquitin ligases to proteins involved in chromatin, transcription, and membrane trafficking, functions not regulated by such a system in prokaryotes. The subnetwork of LECA nucleoporins will form a highly interconnected module, distinct from the simpler membrane-coating complexes found in Asgard archaea. \n\n**Validation Strategy:** Our hypotheses will be tested through rigorous computational and statistical analysis. Network topology predictions will be tested using standard network science metrics. Inferred interactions will be validated internally using a multi-evidence scoring scheme; high-confidence predictions will be further tested for structural plausibility using AlphaFold-Multimer to model the ancestral protein complexes. The conservation of inferred ancestral interactions across diverse modern eukaryotic lineages will provide an independent line of phylogenetic validation.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is a large-scale data synthesis effort that will be executed in four integrated phases by a multidisciplinary working group. Our approach is designed to be modular, reproducible, and transparent, adhering to the highest standards of open science. \n\n**Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Curation and Orthology Inference (Months 1-6)** \n*   **Data Sources:** We will synthesize data from multiple public repositories. \n    *   **Genomic/Proteomic Data:** We will assemble a dataset of over 700 proteomes, including all available high-quality eukaryotic genomes from NCBI and Ensembl, with a special focus on deep phylogenetic sampling using the EukProt database to include diverse protist lineages. For our prokaryotic outgroup, we will include all available Asgard archaeal genomes and a representative set of over 200 other archaeal and bacterial genomes. \n    *   **Interaction Data:** We will compile a comprehensive database of experimentally determined protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from BioGRID, IntAct, and STRING for multiple model eukaryotes (H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, C. elegans). We will filter these data to retain only high-confidence interactions supported by direct physical evidence. \n    *   **Structural Data:** We will utilize experimentally determined structures from the PDB and the comprehensive set of predicted structures from the AlphaFold DB. \n*   **Orthology and Phylogeny:** We will use the graph-based algorithm OrthoFinder to delineate orthologous groups (OGs) across all 700+ species. For each OG, we will build a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE. These trees will be used to precisely identify the set of OGs that were present in LECA and to resolve one-to-one orthologs between species, which is critical for subsequent analyses. A robust species tree will be constructed from a concatenated alignment of ~100 conserved, single-copy proteins to serve as the scaffold for ancestral reconstruction. \n\n**Phase 2: Ancestral Sequence and Proteome Reconstruction (Months 7-12)** \n*   **Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR):** For each OG determined to be present in LECA, we will perform ASR. Using the OG's multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree, we will use a maximum-likelihood method (e.g., PAML or PhyloBot) to infer the most probable amino acid sequence of the LECA protein. We will quantify uncertainty by calculating posterior probabilities for each amino acid at each site. This process will yield the first high-fidelity reconstruction of the LECA proteome. \n\n**Phase 3: Ancestral Interactome Inference (Months 13-24)** \nThis core phase uses a multi-pronged, evidence-integration approach to reconstruct the LECA interactome. We will infer potential interactions and assign a confidence score to each based on a weighted combination of the following four methods: \n1.  **Interolog Mapping:** We will map known interactions from modern model organisms onto the LECA proteome. An interaction is inferred if both interacting partners in a modern species have clear orthologs in our reconstructed LECA proteome. This forms our baseline network. \n2.  **Co-evolutionary Analysis:** We will search for correlated evolutionary histories between pairs of protein families. This will involve two computationally intensive methods: i) MirrorTree, which assesses the similarity of the phylogenetic trees of two protein families, and ii) Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), which identifies co-evolving residue pairs across concatenated multiple sequence alignments. Strong co-evolutionary signals are powerful predictors of direct physical interaction. \n3.  **Structural Modeling of Ancestral Complexes:** For pairs of LECA proteins predicted to interact by other methods, we will use their reconstructed ancestral sequences as input for AlphaFold-Multimer. A high-confidence structural prediction of the complex, with a well-defined interface and low predicted aligned error (PAE), will provide strong, independent evidence for a direct physical interaction. This step is crucial for validating and refining our network. \n4.  **Domain-Interaction Context:** We will leverage databases of known domain-domain interactions (e.g., 3did). An interaction will be inferred if two LECA proteins contain domains that are known to mediate interactions in modern proteins. \n*   **Network Integration:** Evidence from these four streams will be integrated using a Bayesian framework to calculate a final confidence score for each potential interaction. This allows us to generate interactome maps at various confidence thresholds for robust downstream analysis. \n\n**Phase 4: Comparative Network Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Months 25-36)** \n*   **Prokaryotic Ancestral Interactome:** We will apply the exact same pipeline to reconstruct the interactome of the last Asgard archaeal common ancestor, providing a direct, high-quality prokaryotic network for comparison. \n*   **Network Analysis:** Using computational tools like NetworkX and Cytoscape, we will perform a detailed comparative analysis of the LECA and Asgard interactomes. We will test our hypotheses by comparing global network properties (degree distribution, modularity, path lengths), identifying novel LECA hubs, and mapping the rewiring of conserved proteins. We will use community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain) to identify functional modules and perform enrichment analyses based on the protein domains within each module to functionally annotate them (e.g., 'ancestral kinetochore', 'ancestral Golgi/ER transport'). \n\n**Timeline & Milestones:** \n*   **Year 1:** Completion of data curation, orthology inference, and ancestral sequence reconstruction. **Milestone:** A publicly released, high-quality LECA proteome. \n*   **Year 2:** Development and execution of the multi-evidence interactome inference pipeline. **Milestone:** A first-draft, scored LECA interactome and Asgard interactome. \n*   **Year 3:** Comparative network analysis, hypothesis testing, structural validation of key complexes, and dissemination. **Milestones:** Final, validated ancestral interactomes; public web portal for data exploration; submission of primary manuscripts.",

Its impact will extend from providing a foundational resource for the scientific community to training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. \n\n**Expected Outcomes:** \n1.  **The First Comprehensive LECA Interactome:** The primary deliverable will be a high-confidence, computationally reconstructed protein-protein interaction network for the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. This 'wiring diagram' of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, delivered via an interactive public web portal, will be a durable and invaluable resource. It will allow researchers to explore the ancestral context of their favorite proteins, visualize the architecture of primordial cellular machinery, and generate novel, testable hypotheses about the function and evolution of eukaryotic systems. \n2.  **Deep Insights into the Origin of Eukaryotic Complexity:** By systematically comparing the LECA interactome with that of its closest prokaryotic relatives, we will move beyond speculation to data-driven inference about the emergence of eukaryotic features. Our analysis will pinpoint the specific interactions and network modules that were gained or rewired during eukaryogenesis, providing concrete models for the assembly of the nucleus, the endomembrane system, the cytoskeleton, and complex regulatory networks like the ubiquitin system. \n3.  **A Novel and Powerful Methodological Framework:** We will develop and validate an innovative, open-source computational pipeline for ancestral network reconstruction. This integrative framework, which combines phylogenomics, co-evolutionary analysis, and cutting-edge structural modeling, will be a significant methodological contribution. It will be broadly applicable to the study of other major evolutionary transitions and the evolution of other complex biological networks. \n\n**Broader Impacts and Alignment with Research Call:** \nThis project is perfectly aligned with the funding organization's mission. It is a community-scale synthesis project that tackles a fundamental question in molecular and cellular biosciences using exclusively publicly available data. \n*   **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** The project's success hinges on the deep integration of expertise from our working group, which includes evolutionary genomicists, cell biologists, and computational network scientists. This transdisciplinary environment is essential for interpreting the results and is beyond the capacity of any single lab. \n*   **Training and Workforce Development:** The project will provide an exceptional training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

We will host an annual workshop for the working group to share methods and foster collaboration, directly contributing to a future data-savvy scientific workforce. \n*   **Commitment to Open Science:** We are fundamentally committed to open, reproducible, and transparent science. All analysis scripts and workflows will be version-controlled and shared on GitHub. All derived data, including alignments, ancestral sequences, and the final network models, will be deposited in Zenodo. The final interactome will be made fully accessible through a user-friendly web portal, ensuring its broad use and long-term impact. \n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:** \nWe will disseminate our findings through high-impact publications, with plans for a flagship paper describing the LECA interactome and several follow-up studies on specific subcellular systems. We will also present our work at major international conferences (e.g., Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, American Society for Cell Biology). The long-term vision is for this project to serve as a cornerstone for a new field of 'paleo-proteomics'. The reconstructed ancestral proteins can be synthesized for in vitro biochemical characterization, experimentally validating our computational predictions. This project lays the groundwork for reconstructing the evolutionary trajectory of the interactome across the entire tree of life, providing a dynamic movie of cellular evolution rather than a single snapshot.",

        "background_and_significance": "The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a foundational hallmark of cancer, enabling the rapid proliferation and survival of tumor cells in diverse microenvironments. First observed by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, this phenomenon, characterized by elevated glucose uptake and lactate production even in the presence of oxygen, is now understood to be part of a much broader metabolic rewiring. This rewiring supports not only energy production but also the biosynthesis of macromolecules (nucleotides, lipids, amino acids) and the maintenance of redox homeostasis, all of which are critical for cell growth and division. Seminal studies have elucidated key metabolic pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer, including aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), glutaminolysis, and fatty acid synthesis. These alterations are often driven by the same oncogenes (e.g., MYC, PI3K/AKT) and tumor suppressors (e.g., p53, LKB1) that control cell cycle and apoptosis, highlighting the deep integration of metabolism with core cancer signaling networks.\n\nDespite this progress, our understanding of cancer metabolism remains fragmented. Much of the foundational work has been conducted in specific cancer cell lines or mouse models, which may not fully capture the metabolic heterogeneity observed in human tumors. Pan-cancer analyses, which study multiple cancer types simultaneously, have begun to address this, revealing both shared and distinct metabolic features. For instance, analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomic data have successfully clustered tumors based on their metabolic gene expression profiles, linking them to specific mutations and clinical outcomes. However, these studies have significant limitations. Most rely predominantly on transcriptomic data, which is an imperfect proxy for enzymatic activity, as protein levels and metabolic fluxes are regulated by complex post-transcriptional, translational, and allosteric mechanisms. The integration of proteomic and metabolomic data is essential for a more accurate depiction of the metabolic state, but such multi-omic integration at a pan-cancer scale has been technically challenging and rarely attempted.\n\nA critical unanswered question in the field is the extent to which metabolic vulnerabilities are conserved across different cancer types versus being context-dependent. Identifying a core set of metabolic dependencies shared by most tumors could lead to the development of broad-spectrum therapies effective against a wide range of malignancies. Conversely, understanding the unique metabolic liabilities imposed by a specific driver mutation (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations in glioma and AML) or a particular tissue of origin (e.g., the unique reliance of clear cell renal carcinoma on glycogen and lipid metabolism) is the cornerstone of precision medicine. Currently, there is no systematic, large-scale resource that maps this landscape of conserved and specific metabolic vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of human cancers.\n\nThis research is both important and timely due to a confluence of factors. First, the public availability of massive, high-quality multi-omics datasets from consortia like TCGA, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) provides an unprecedented opportunity for data synthesis. For the first time, we have genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and, in some cases, metabolomic data for thousands of patient tumors. Second, computational methods, particularly genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs), have matured to a point where they can integrate these multi-omic data layers to simulate cellular metabolism with increasing accuracy. Third, the clinical pipeline for metabolic drugs is growing, yet their efficacy is often limited to specific patient subsets, underscoring the urgent need for biomarkers to guide their use. This project directly addresses these gaps by proposing a community-scale synthesis effort that leverages these public data and advanced computational tools to create a definitive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas. This resource will provide a systems-level understanding of cancer metabolism, distinguishing universal principles from context-specific adaptations and thereby accelerating the development of more effective metabolic therapies.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This project is organized around four central research aims designed to systematically map the landscape of cancer metabolism. Each aim poses a fundamental question and is associated with a specific, testable hypothesis that will be addressed through the synthesis of pan-cancer multi-omics data.\n\n**Aim 1: To construct a comprehensive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas by generating context-specific metabolic models for all major cancer subtypes.**\n*   **Research Question:** Can we develop a robust and scalable computational pipeline to integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from over 20,000 tumors to build accurate, patient-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs)?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that metabolic models constrained by integrated multi-omics data, particularly proteomics, will more accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and functional states than models based on transcriptomics alone. We predict that this approach will reveal distinct and coherent metabolic clusters both within and across cancer types, reflecting their underlying biology.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** The accuracy of our models will be validated in several ways. First, we will assess their ability to recapitulate known metabolic hallmarks of specific cancers (e.g., high lactate secretion in glycolytic tumors, 2-hydroxyglutarate production in IDH1-mutant gliomas). Second, where available, we will compare model-predicted reaction fluxes with experimentally measured metabolic flux data from published studies on relevant cell lines. Third, we will evaluate the internal consistency of the models by correlating predicted metabolic pathway activities with the expression levels of key regulatory enzymes.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** The primary deliverable for this aim is the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas itself: a collection of over 20,000 context-specific GEMs, forming a foundational resource for the subsequent aims and the broader research community.\n\n**Aim 2: To identify a core set of conserved metabolic reactions and pathways that represent pan-cancer vulnerabilities.**\n*   **Research Question:** Across the vast heterogeneity of human cancers, is there a conserved set of metabolic enzymes and pathways that are consistently essential for tumor cell survival and proliferation, regardless of tissue of origin or genetic driver?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a core set of metabolic dependencies exists, centered on essential biomass precursor synthesis (e.g., nucleotide and amino acid synthesis) and redox balance (e.g., the pentose phosphate pathway and glutathione metabolism). We predict that the enzymes governing these pathways represent robust, high-priority targets for broad-spectrum metabolic therapies.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** Using our atlas of GEMs, we will perform in silico essentiality screens (e.g., simulating single gene/reaction knockouts) for every model. Reactions or genes predicted to be essential in a statistically significant majority of tumors (>90%) will be defined as 'core dependencies'. We will validate this list of predicted essential genes by cross-referencing it with large-scale experimental CRISPR/Cas9 essentiality datasets, such as the DepMap project, to confirm their functional importance in cancer cell lines.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** A high-confidence, ranked list of conserved metabolic enzyme targets, annotated with multi-omic evidence and functional genomics data, that can guide the development of pan-cancer therapeutic strategies.\n\n**Aim 3: To uncover tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities linked to genetic drivers and tissue-of-origin.**\n*   **Research Question:** How do specific oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, BRAF, IDH1, VHL) and the cellular lineage of a tumor shape its metabolic network to create unique, context-dependent liabilities?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that distinct metabolic phenotypes are strongly coupled to the genetic and lineage context of a tumor. We predict that our models will identify specific metabolic pathways that are uniquely upregulated and essential in tumors with a given driver mutation (e.g., a dependency on reductive carboxylation in tumors with mitochondrial dysfunction) or from a specific tissue (e.g., steroidogenesis in adrenal cancers).\n*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** We will employ a range of machine learning and statistical methods to associate predicted metabolic fluxes with mutation status, copy number alterations, and cancer type. For example, we will use regression models to identify metabolic reactions whose activity is significantly correlated with the presence of a KRAS mutation across all cancer types. These associations will be validated against the extensive body of literature on mutation-specific metabolic reprogramming.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** A comprehensive map linking key cancer drivers and tissues of origin to their predicted metabolic dependencies, providing a rational basis for developing personalized metabolic therapies.\n\n**Aim 4: To correlate metabolic phenotypes with clinical outcomes and therapeutic response.**\n*   **Research Question:** Can the metabolic signatures derived from our models serve as biomarkers to predict patient prognosis (e.g., survival, recurrence) or the response to specific anti-cancer drugs?\n*   **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that distinct metabolic states, such as a 'highly glycolytic' versus a 'highly oxidative' phenotype, will be significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we predict that the activity of specific metabolic pathways can predict sensitivity or resistance to both metabolic inhibitors and conventional chemotherapies that are metabolically-linked (e.g., antifolates like methotrexate).\n*   **Hypothesis Testing and Validation:** We will use survival analysis models (Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards) to test for significant associations between model-predicted reaction fluxes and patient survival data from TCGA. To investigate therapeutic response, we will correlate our predicted metabolic phenotypes with large-scale drug sensitivity screens from cancer cell line encyclopedias (e.g., GDSC, CCLE), identifying metabolic predictors of drug efficacy.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** A set of novel, validated metabolic biomarkers with the potential to stratify patients for prognosis and guide therapeutic decisions.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will execute a systematic, multi-stage plan to synthesize public multi-omics data into a comprehensive Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas. Our approach is designed to be rigorous, reproducible, and transparent, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group.\n\n**Data Acquisition and Harmonization**\nThe foundation of this project is the aggregation and harmonization of publicly available data. We will source data primarily from three major consortia:\n1.  **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):** We will download processed somatic mutation data (VCFs), copy number variation (CNV) data, and normalized RNA-Seq expression data for approximately 11,000 tumors across 33 cancer types from the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).\n2.  **Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC):** We will acquire processed, normalized mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics data for over 1,500 tumors, which largely overlap with the TCGA cohort, providing a critical layer of protein-level information.\n3.  **International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC):** We will incorporate data from the ICGC Data Portal to expand our cohort size and increase the diversity of cancer types, adding several thousand additional tumor samples with genomic and transcriptomic data.\nAssociated clinical data, including patient survival, tumor stage, grade, and treatment history, will be downloaded from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. All data will be aggregated into a unified data matrix. A rigorous harmonization pipeline will be developed to handle batch effects and normalize data from different sources, ensuring comparability across the entire cohort of over 20,000 samples. This will involve standardized data processing scripts and statistical normalization techniques (e.g., ComBat for batch correction).\n\n**Computational Pipeline for Model Construction and Analysis**\nOur analytical workflow is centered on the construction and interrogation of context-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).\n\n**Step 1: Construction of Context-Specific GEMs.** We will start with the most recent, comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon3D, as our template model. For each of the ~20,000 tumor samples, we will generate a context-specific model using an algorithm that integrates multi-omics data. We will employ the GIMME algorithm or a similar method, which prunes the generic network based on gene expression data to retain only active reactions. Crucially, we will extend this framework to incorporate proteomics data from the CPTAC cohort. Protein abundance levels will be used to directly constrain the upper bounds of the corresponding enzymatic reaction fluxes, a method known as building enzyme-constrained models (ecGEMs). This integration of proteomics is a key innovation of our approach, as it provides a more direct measure of enzyme capacity than transcript levels alone. This entire process will be automated in a high-throughput pipeline to generate a unique metabolic model for every tumor sample.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Conserved Vulnerabilities (Aim 2).** To identify pan-cancer dependencies, we will perform a systematic in silico knockout screen on each of the 20,000 models. Using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), we will simulate the removal of each gene and reaction in the network and calculate the effect on a cellular objective function, such as biomass production (a proxy for proliferation). Genes whose removal is predicted to be lethal (i.e., reduces biomass production below a threshold) in a high percentage of models across all cancer types will be classified as core pan-cancer essential genes. We will use permutation testing to assess the statistical significance of our findings.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Specific Vulnerabilities (Aim 3).** To link metabolic phenotypes to genetic and lineage context, we will use a machine learning approach. We will treat the predicted flux values for all metabolic reactions in our models as a feature set. We will then train classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to predict the mutation status of key cancer drivers (e.g., KRAS, IDH1, VHL) or the tissue of origin based on these metabolic features. Feature importance scores from these models will highlight the specific metabolic reactions that are most distinctive of each context, representing potential targeted vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Correlation with Clinical Data (Aim 4).** We will perform two main analyses. First, for survival analysis, we will use Cox proportional hazards models to identify metabolic reactions whose predicted fluxes are significantly associated with patient overall survival or progression-free survival, while controlling for confounding variables like tumor stage and age. Second, to predict drug response, we will build regression models that link metabolic features to drug sensitivity (IC50) data in cancer cell lines (from GDSC/CCLE) and then apply these predictive models to our tumor data to infer patient-specific drug sensitivities.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones**\n*   **Year 1 (Months 1-12):** Assemble the working group. Finalize data acquisition from TCGA, CPTAC, and ICGC. Develop and validate the data harmonization and model-building pipeline. Generate the first iteration of ~20,000 transcriptomics-based GEMs. Hold a training workshop for all trainees on the computational pipeline. **Milestone: Pipeline established and first-pass models generated.**\n*   **Year 2 (Months 13-24):** Integrate proteomics data to refine models into ecGEMs for the CPTAC cohort. Complete the analyses for Aim 2 (conserved vulnerabilities) and Aim 3 (specific vulnerabilities). Begin drafting the first manuscript. Present preliminary findings at a national conference. **Milestone: Completion of core and specific vulnerability analyses.**\n*   **Year 3 (Months 25-36):** Complete the analysis for Aim 4 (clinical correlations). Develop and launch the public web portal for the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas, allowing community access to data and models. Finalize and submit manuscripts for publication. Disseminate tools and findings through workshops and conference presentations. **Milestone: Public launch of the Atlas and submission of primary manuscripts.**\n\nThis project's scale and multidisciplinary nature, requiring expertise in bioinformatics, systems biology, cancer genomics, and machine learning, make it an ideal fit for the NCEMS working group model, as it far exceeds the capabilities of any single research lab.",

Our contributions will be multifaceted, spanning the creation of a major community resource, the generation of novel biological insights, the identification of therapeutic targets, and the training of a new generation of data-savvy scientists.\n\n**Key Deliverables and Scientific Contributions:**\n1.  **The Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas:** The primary outcome will be a publicly accessible, comprehensive resource comprising over 20,000 context-specific metabolic models of human tumors. This Atlas, disseminated through an intuitive web portal, will allow researchers worldwide to query metabolic pathway activity across dozens of cancer types, explore relationships between genetic alterations and metabolic phenotypes, and download models and data for their own analyses. This will be an enduring resource that democratizes the use of systems biology approaches in cancer research and will serve as a foundational dataset for countless future studies.\n2.  **A Definitive Map of Conserved vs. Specific Metabolic Dependencies:** By systematically analyzing this unprecedented collection of models, we will provide the first comprehensive, data-driven answer to a fundamental question in cancer metabolism: which vulnerabilities are universal, and which are context-specific? This will resolve long-standing debates and provide a clear framework for thinking about metabolic therapies, guiding the development of both broad-spectrum and precision medicine strategies.\n3.  **High-Confidence Therapeutic Targets and Biomarkers:** Our project will generate concrete, actionable lists of novel therapeutic targets. The identified core metabolic dependencies will represent high-priority targets for pan-cancer drug development. The context-specific vulnerabilities will provide a roadmap for personalized medicine, suggesting which patients might benefit from targeting a particular metabolic pathway based on their tumor's genetic makeup or tissue of origin. Furthermore, the metabolic signatures correlated with clinical outcomes will serve as novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers, with the potential for future clinical translation.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Alignment with NCEMS Goals:**\nThis project is perfectly aligned with the mission of the NCEMS research call. It is a community-scale synthesis project that exclusively uses publicly available data to address a fundamental question in cellular biosciences. The project's success hinges on the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team, bringing together expertise that would not be found in a single lab. \n*   **Training the Next Generation:** A core component of our plan is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

All computational pipelines and analysis scripts will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub. All generated data, metabolic models, and results will be deposited in public repositories and shared through our project web portal under permissive licenses, adhering to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**\nOur dissemination strategy is designed for maximum impact. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. We will present our work at major international conferences, such as the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB). We will also organize workshops to train the broader research community on how to use the Pan-Cancer Metabolic Atlas and our computational tools. The long-term vision is for the Atlas to become a living resource, continuously updated as new public datasets (e.g., from single-cell omics studies) become available. It will serve as a hypothesis-generating engine, sparking new avenues of experimental research and fostering collaborations between computational modelers, cancer biologists, and clinicians to validate our findings and translate them into improved patient care.",

        "background_and_significance": "The dynamic interplay between viruses and their hosts represents a powerful engine of molecular evolution, shaping the genomes and proteomes of both entities in a perpetual 'arms race'. Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, must commandeer host cellular machinery for their replication while simultaneously evading sophisticated host immune defenses. In response, hosts evolve diverse antiviral mechanisms to detect and neutralize viral threats. Understanding the fundamental principles governing these molecular conflicts is one of the most pressing challenges in modern biology, with profound implications for public health, particularly in an era of increasing pandemic risk. The recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a stark reminder of our vulnerability to emerging viral pathogens and underscored the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies that are effective against entire viral families or novel threats.\n\nThe current state of the field is characterized by a wealth of data generated from reductionist, single-system studies. Over the past two decades, high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), and proximity-labeling techniques (e.g., BioID) have enabled the mapping of host-virus protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for numerous individual viruses, including influenza, HIV, dengue, and coronaviruses. These efforts have produced invaluable parts lists, identifying hundreds of host factors that physically associate with viral proteins. Concurrently, transcriptomic profiling (RNA-seq, microarrays) has provided a global view of the host cellular response to infection, revealing stereotyped responses like the activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) as well as virus-specific transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, the field of paleovirology, pioneered by researchers like Harmit Malik and Michael Emerman, has demonstrated how signatures of positive selection (antagonistic co-evolution) in host genes can be used to uncover ancient and ongoing host-virus conflicts.\n\nDespite this explosion of data, a major limitation persists: the data remains highly fragmented and siloed. Interaction maps are typically generated for a single virus in a single host cell type, and data resides in disparate databases (e.g., BioGRID, IntAct, VirusMentha) and hundreds of individual publications. This fragmentation prevents the scientific community from discerning the general principles that transcend specific host-virus pairs. Key questions remain unanswered: Are there universal 'host defense hubs' that are convergently targeted by many different viruses? Do unrelated viruses evolve common strategies to subvert these hubs? Can we identify the precise molecular interfaces under the strongest evolutionary pressure? Answering these questions requires a large-scale data synthesis approach that integrates PPIs, transcriptomics, protein structures, and evolutionary data across a wide phylogenetic range of viruses and hosts. Such an endeavor is beyond the capacity of any single research laboratory, demanding a collaborative, transdisciplinary effort that combines expertise in virology, immunology, computational network biology, and evolutionary genetics. This project is therefore perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission to catalyze community-scale synthesis projects that address fundamental questions by integrating publicly available data. By unifying this fragmented knowledge, we can move from a descriptive, virus-by-virus understanding to a predictive framework of host-virus interactions, which is critical for developing next-generation antiviral therapies and preparing for future viral outbreaks.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research proposal is structured around three primary aims, each designed to address a fundamental question about the conserved nature of host-virus conflicts. By systematically integrating diverse public datasets, we will test a series of specific, interconnected hypotheses that, taken together, will build a comprehensive model of the molecular arms race.\n\n**Aim 1: Identify Conserved Host Defense Hubs through Integrated Network Analysis.** This aim seeks to define the core cellular machinery that constitutes the front lines of antiviral defense.\n*   **Research Question 1:** Are there specific host proteins or cellular pathways that are disproportionately and convergently targeted by a wide range of evolutionarily diverse viruses across different host species?\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** We hypothesize that a discrete set of host proteins, which we term 'host defense hubs,' function as central nodes in intrinsic and innate immunity and are therefore repeatedly targeted by unrelated viruses as a common strategy to disable host defenses. These hubs are not merely abundant or 'sticky' proteins but are functionally critical for antiviral responses.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** We predict that these hubs will be significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways related to immunity and viral lifecycle interference, such as ubiquitination, RNA processing, nuclear transport, and interferon signaling. Furthermore, we predict they will exhibit high centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness) within the integrated host-virus interactome.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will construct a comprehensive host-virus interaction network and employ permutation-based statistical tests to identify host proteins with a significantly greater number of unique viral family interactors than expected by chance. The functional importance of identified hubs will be validated by cross-referencing our list with orthogonal data from published genome-wide CRISPR screens that identify host dependency and restriction factors. Hubs that are both frequently targeted and identified as critical in functional screens will be considered high-confidence candidates.\n\n**Aim 2: Uncover Conserved Viral Evasion Strategies by Analyzing Viral Protein Targeting Patterns.** This aim focuses on the viral side of the conflict, seeking to identify a 'playbook' of common viral tactics.\n*   **Research Question 2:** Do phylogenetically distinct viruses evolve functionally analogous proteins that engage the same host hubs or pathways to achieve similar outcomes, such as immune evasion or replication support?\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** We hypothesize that viral proteins can be clustered into functional 'orthogroups' based on their shared host interaction profiles, even when they lack detectable sequence or structural homology. These clusters will represent convergent evolutionary solutions to common problems faced by all viruses.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b:** We predict that for a given host hub, the physical binding interfaces for proteins from different viruses will frequently overlap or be allosterically coupled, indicating that viral evolution is constrained to target specific functional sites on the host protein.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will use community detection algorithms on a bipartite network of viral proteins and their host targets to identify clusters of viral proteins with similar interaction 'fingerprints'. The biological relevance of these clusters will be assessed by analyzing the functions of their common host targets. For hubs with available structural data (from PDB or AlphaFold), we will perform structural alignments of their complexes with different viral proteins to statistically test for significant overlap in their binding interfaces.\n\n**Aim 3: Pinpoint High-Conflict Interfaces using Signatures of Antagonistic Co-evolution.** This aim will add an evolutionary dimension to our static interaction map, highlighting the most dynamic and contested molecular interfaces.\n*   **Research Question 3:** Can the integration of evolutionary rate analysis with interaction data pinpoint the specific amino acid residues at the heart of the host-virus arms race?\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** We hypothesize that host defense hubs and their direct viral protein interactors will exhibit significantly elevated rates of positive selection (dN/dS > 1) compared to the rest of the proteome, reflecting recurrent adaptation and counter-adaptation.\n*   **Hypothesis 3b:** We predict that the specific codons identified as being under positive selection in a host hub will be non-randomly distributed and will map disproportionately to the structurally-defined interaction interface with its viral antagonist.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will compile alignments of orthologous sequences for high-confidence interacting pairs. Using phylogenetic software like PAML and HyPhy, we will calculate dN/dS ratios and identify sites under positive selection. We will then map these sites onto protein structures and use a robust statistical test (e.g., a 3D clustering algorithm) to determine if these 'evolutionary hotspots' are significantly co-localized with the physical interaction interface.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a transdisciplinary Working Group composed of three Principal Investigators and their trainees, bringing together expertise in virology, network biology, and evolutionary genetics. The project is organized into three phases: Data Acquisition and Integration, Multi-modal Analysis, and Dissemination. This structure ensures a logical progression from data foundation to knowledge generation, directly addressing the research call's emphasis on synthesis, collaboration, and open science.\n\n**Working Group Composition and Roles:**\n*   **PI 1 (Virology & Immunology):** Dr. Jane Smith (University of Virology). Expertise in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. Role: Guide biological interpretation, curate virus-specific datasets, and lead manuscript preparation.\n*   **PI 2 (Computational & Network Biology):** Dr. John Doe (Institute for Systems Biology). Expertise in bioinformatics, data integration, and network analysis. Role: Lead the development of the integrated database, perform all network analyses (Aim 1 & 2), and manage the project's computational infrastructure.\n*   **PI 3 (Evolutionary Genetics):** Dr. Emily Stone (State University, Dept. of Genetics). Expertise in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. Role: Lead all evolutionary analyses (Aim 3), including sequence acquisition and positive selection modeling.\n*   **Trainees (2 Postdocs, 2 Graduate Students):** Trainees will be central to the project's execution, providing dedicated effort for data curation, analysis, and tool development. They will benefit from co-mentorship by all PIs, participate in all group meetings, and receive cross-disciplinary training, fulfilling the NCEMS goal of training a data-savvy workforce.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Curation, and Integration (Months 1-9)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on building the comprehensive, multi-layered dataset that will power our analyses.\n1.  **Data Sources:** We will systematically gather data from a wide array of public repositories. \n    *   **Host-Virus PPIs:** We will query BioGRID, IntAct, HPIDB, VirusMentha, and P-HIPSTer. This will be supplemented by text mining of the full-text biomedical literature using natural language processing (NLP) tools to capture newly published or un-curated interactions.\n    *   **Host Transcriptomics:** We will download and uniformly process raw RNA-seq and microarray data from GEO and ArrayExpress for hundreds of studies involving viral infection of mammalian cells. A standardized pipeline (e.g., using Kallisto for RNA-seq) will be used to generate comparable differential expression profiles.\n    *   **Protein Structures:** We will retrieve experimental structures from the PDB and leverage the comprehensive, high-quality predicted structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database for both host and viral proteins.\n    *   **Orthologous Sequences:** We will obtain protein-coding sequences and pre-computed orthology groups from databases like OrthoDB, Ensembl, and NCBI RefSeq.\n2.  **Data Integration Framework:** A key innovation of this project is the creation of a unified data model. All entities (proteins, genes, viruses, interactions) will be mapped to stable identifiers (e.g., UniProt, Ensembl, NCBI TaxID). We will develop a confidence scoring system for PPIs based on the number of independent experimental methods and publications supporting them. All curated and processed data will be loaded into a Neo4j graph database, which is optimized for storing and querying complex network relationships.\n\n**Phase 2: Multi-modal Network and Evolutionary Analysis (Months 10-24)**\n1.  **Aim 1 Analysis (Months 10-15):** We will construct the integrated host-virus interactome. To identify 'host defense hubs', we will calculate a 'viral convergence score' for each host protein, defined as the number of distinct viral families it interacts with. Statistical significance will be assessed using a permutation test that controls for protein length, expression level, and overall interaction degree (to avoid known biases). The resulting list of hubs will be functionally annotated using enrichment analysis (g:Profiler) and cross-validated against CRISPR screen data (from sources like Project Achilles).\n2.  **Aim 2 Analysis (Months 16-20):** We will construct a bipartite graph of viral proteins and their host targets. We will apply the Louvain community detection algorithm to this network to identify modules of viral proteins that share similar host interaction profiles. For structurally characterized hubs, we will use tools like ProBis and ChimeraX to predict and compare binding interfaces for different viral partners, quantifying spatial overlap to test for convergent targeting of specific functional sites.\n3.  **Aim 3 Analysis (Months 16-24):** For high-confidence interacting pairs identified in Aim 1, we will create multiple sequence alignments of orthologs. We will use the codeml program in the PAML package to fit codon-based models of evolution and perform likelihood ratio tests to detect positive selection along specific lineages. To identify individual sites, we will use empirical Bayes methods (in PAML) and complementary approaches like MEME (in HyPhy). The spatial coordinates of positively selected sites will be mapped onto protein structures, and we will use a custom Python script to test for their statistical enrichment at the PPI interface compared to the rest of the protein surface.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and database construction (M9). First version of the integrated network and preliminary identification of host defense hubs (M12). First annual in-person Working Group meeting.\n*   **Year 2:** Complete viral strategy clustering and structural interface analysis (M18). Complete evolutionary analysis for the top 100 candidate interacting pairs (M24). Submit database/resource manuscript. Second annual meeting.\n*   **Year 3:** Finalize all analyses and interpretation. Submit manuscripts for Aims 2 and 3. Launch public web portal for data exploration. Final meeting to plan follow-on proposals and ensure long-term sustainability of the resource.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to produce a transformative shift in our understanding of host-virus interactions, moving from a collection of individual case studies to a unified, predictive framework. The expected outcomes will have a profound and lasting impact on molecular and cellular biosciences, with direct applications in public health and pandemic preparedness.\n\n**Expected Outcomes and Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **A Centralized, Integrated Community Resource:** The primary deliverable will be the Cross-Species Host-Virus Interactome (CS-HVI), a publicly accessible database and web portal. This resource will be the first of its kind to integrate PPI, transcriptomic, structural, and evolutionary data across hundreds of viruses and multiple host species. By breaking down existing data silos, the CS-HVI will serve as a foundational resource for the virology, immunology, and systems biology communities, enabling countless new hypotheses to be generated and tested by researchers worldwide. All data, code, and analysis workflows will be made available under open-source licenses, adhering to the highest standards of reproducible science as mandated by the NCEMS call.\n2.  **A Data-Driven Catalog of Core Antiviral Machinery:** Our analysis will produce a high-confidence, ranked list of 'host defense hubs'—the key proteins and pathways that form the central battleground of host-virus conflicts. This provides a host-centric 'vulnerability map' of the cell, highlighting the machinery that is most critical for antiviral defense and therefore most frequently targeted by viruses. This will fundamentally reorient research priorities toward understanding these core cellular defense systems.\n3.  **A Novel Functional Classification of Viral Proteins:** By clustering viral proteins based on their host-targeting patterns, we will create a new functional taxonomy that is independent of viral sequence homology. This will reveal convergent evolutionary strategies employed by disparate viruses to solve common problems, such as evading interferon signaling or hijacking the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This functional map will be invaluable for predicting the roles of uncharacterized proteins from newly discovered viruses.\n4.  **High-Resolution Maps of Molecular Arms Races:** The integration of evolutionary analysis will pinpoint the specific amino acid residues at host-virus interfaces that are under intense selective pressure. This provides direct, dynamic evidence of molecular conflict and validates the functional importance of these interactions, moving beyond the static picture provided by PPI data alone.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Informing Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Development:** Host-directed therapies represent a promising strategy for combating viral diseases, as they are thought to be less susceptible to the evolution of viral resistance. Our catalog of host defense hubs provides a rationalized list of high-value targets for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that could be effective against entire families of viruses or even novel pathogens.\n*   **Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness:** The framework developed in this project can be used to rapidly generate hypotheses about the mechanisms of a novel emerging virus. Upon sequencing the genome of a 'Virus X', its proteins can be structurally modeled and compared to the functional clusters in our CS-HVI database to predict which host pathways it is likely to manipulate. This can accelerate the scientific response, guiding experimental work and the search for therapeutic interventions.\n*   **Training the Next Generation of Scientists:** This project is an ideal training environment. The four trainees will become experts in a rare combination of virology, computational biology, and evolutionary genetics. They will gain hands-on experience in large-scale data management, network analysis, collaborative science, and open research practices, preparing them to be leaders in the data-intensive biosciences of the future.\n\n**Dissemination Plan:** We will pursue a multi-pronged dissemination strategy. We anticipate at least three high-impact publications in journals like Cell, Nature, or Science. Findings will be presented at key international conferences (e.g., ASV, ISMB, SMBE). The most important dissemination tool will be the CS-HVI web portal, which will provide intuitive tools for data visualization, querying, and bulk download, ensuring the project's outputs are maximally useful to the global research community.",

        "background_and_significance": "The inheritance of acquired characteristics, a concept once dismissed as Lamarckian, has re-emerged as a frontier in modern biology under the framework of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TGEI). TGEI posits that environmental exposures can induce molecular changes to the epigenome that are not only stable within an organism's lifetime but can also be transmitted through the germline to subsequent, unexposed generations. This phenomenon fundamentally challenges the Modern Synthesis of evolutionary theory, which holds that inheritance is mediated almost exclusively through the DNA sequence. The significance of TGEI lies in its potential to act as a mechanism for rapid adaptation and its profound implications for human health, suggesting that parental life experiences, such as diet, stress, or toxicant exposure, could influence disease susceptibility in their descendants.\n\nThe field of TGEI is rich with compelling, yet often isolated, examples across diverse taxa. In the nematode *C. elegans*, starvation in the F0 generation has been shown to induce heritable changes in small RNA expression that regulate gene expression and influence longevity for at least three generations. Similarly, viral infection can trigger an inherited RNA interference (RNAi) response that confers protection to progeny. In *Drosophila*, heat stress has been linked to heritable chromatin state alterations that affect eye color. Seminal work in mammals, though controversial, has suggested that F0 exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin can cause reproductive defects in F3 generation males, correlated with altered DNA methylation in sperm. More recent studies on paternal stress or diet in mice have demonstrated effects on offspring metabolism and behavior, linked to changes in sperm small RNAs. In plants like *Arabidopsis thaliana*, which exhibit less extensive germline epigenetic reprogramming, stress-induced DNA methylation patterns can be stably inherited for multiple generations.\n\nDespite these tantalizing findings, the field faces significant challenges that have prevented the formation of a unified theory of TGEI. A primary limitation is the fragmentation of research efforts. Studies are typically confined to a single model organism, a specific environmental stimulus, and a particular epigenetic mark. This siloed approach makes it impossible to discern whether observed phenomena represent species-specific curiosities or manifestations of a deeply conserved biological principle. Furthermore, methodological inconsistencies abound, including varying definitions of 'transgenerational' (e.g., F2 vs. F3 analysis, which is critical for excluding direct gamete exposure in mammals), different data analysis techniques, and a lack of standardized reporting. This has led to conflicting results and a persistent skepticism about the prevalence and mechanistic basis of TGEI, particularly in mammals where two major waves of epigenetic reprogramming in the germline and early embryo are thought to erase most epigenetic marks.\n\nThis research is both important and timely because we are at a critical inflection point. The explosion of publicly available epigenomic and transcriptomic data from numerous TGEI studies, housed in repositories like GEO and SRA, provides an unprecedented opportunity for a large-scale synthesis. For the first time, it is feasible to systematically collate, re-analyze, and integrate these disparate datasets to search for conserved patterns that are invisible at the level of individual studies. By leveraging this wealth of existing data, our proposed working group can address the key gaps in knowledge: Are there universal epigenetic carriers of inherited information? Are certain genomic regions evolutionarily predisposed to heritable epigenetic modification? Do different environmental stimuli converge on common molecular pathways across species? Answering these questions through a rigorous, cross-species meta-analysis will bring clarity to a contentious field, establish a robust framework for future research, and illuminate a fundamental mechanism by which the environment can leave a lasting echo across generations.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The central goal of this project is to move beyond anecdotal evidence and establish a quantitative, cross-species understanding of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Our research is guided by the overarching question: Are there conserved molecular signatures and mechanistic pathways of TGEI across divergent eukaryotic lineages? To address this, we have formulated four specific, interrelated research questions (RQs) that will structure our investigation.\n\n**RQ1: The Nature of the Heritable Epigenetic Mark.** What are the commonalities and differences in the types of epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications, small non-coding RNAs) that are stably transmitted to F2/F3 generations following parental environmental exposure across *C. elegans*, *Drosophila*, *M. musculus*, and *A. thaliana*? While each of these marks has been implicated in TGEI in specific contexts, it is unknown if one modality serves as a primary, conserved information carrier, or if different species utilize distinct mechanisms.\n\n**RQ2: The Genomic Context of Heritable Epigenetic Change.** Do specific classes of genes or genomic regions consistently serve as targets for heritable epigenetic modifications across species? We will investigate whether loci such as transposable elements (TEs), pericentromeric heterochromatin, developmental regulatory genes, or genes involved in metabolic pathways are disproportionately affected by TGEI, suggesting an inherent susceptibility or functional importance.\n\n**RQ3: The Conservation of TGEI Pathways.** Can we identify conserved molecular pathways that are enriched for genes showing heritable epigenetic alterations? Identifying such pathways would provide strong evidence for a common mechanistic basis for TGEI and point to the core cellular machinery involved in writing, maintaining, and reading heritable epigenetic information across generations.\n\n**RQ4: The Influence of Germline Biology on TGEI Fidelity.** How does the extent of germline epigenetic reprogramming influence the stability and scope of TGEI? By comparing species with extensive reprogramming (mice) against those with less complete erasure (invertebrates, plants), we can assess whether this process acts as a differential filter, allowing only certain types of epigenetic information to pass to the next generation.\n\nTo systematically address these questions, we will test three primary, falsifiable hypotheses:\n\n**Hypothesis 1 (The Conserved Carrier Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) are a deeply conserved carrier of epigenetic information through the germline. We predict that a cross-species meta-analysis of sRNA-seq data from F2/F3 descendants will reveal specific classes of sncRNAs (e.g., piRNAs, endo-siRNAs) that are consistently and significantly altered following parental exposure. Furthermore, we predict that the predicted gene targets of these heritable sncRNAs will themselves show concordant changes in expression or epigenetic state (e.g., increased H3K27me3) and that the enzymatic machinery of these RNA pathways (e.g., Argonaute family proteins) will emerge as a conserved hub in our network analysis.\n\n**Hypothesis 2 (The Genomic Loci Susceptibility Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that transposable elements and other repetitive DNA are evolutionarily conserved hotspots for the establishment of heritable epigenetic states. We predict that across all four species, genomic regions exhibiting heritable changes in repressive marks (e.g., DNA methylation, H3K9me3) will be significantly enriched for TEs compared to the genomic background. We will validate this by testing whether the distance to the nearest TE is a significant predictor of a gene's likelihood of undergoing a heritable epigenetic change.\n\n**Hypothesis 3 (The Stimulus-Response Convergence Hypothesis):** We hypothesize that while the specific genes affected by TGEI are stimulus-dependent, these responses converge on conserved biological pathways across species. We predict that parental exposure to metabolic stressors (e.g., high-fat diet, starvation) will lead to heritable epigenetic changes in orthologous genes within conserved metabolic pathways (e.g., insulin/IGF-1 signaling, TOR signaling) in descendants across mice, flies, and worms. Similarly, we predict that toxicant exposures will heritably alter genes in conserved detoxification and stress-response pathways (e.g., cytochrome P450s, heat shock proteins). Testing this requires a multi-level analysis integrating stimulus classification with cross-species pathway enrichment analysis.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project is designed as a community-scale synthesis effort, leveraging the diverse expertise of our working group in epigenetics, developmental biology, and computational biology to integrate publicly available data. Our approach is organized into three sequential phases, underpinned by a commitment to open and reproducible science.\n\n**Phase 1: Systematic Data Curation and Harmonization (Months 1-6)**\nOur first objective is to build a comprehensive, curated database of TGEI studies. We will perform a systematic search of public repositories, including NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), for relevant datasets.\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:** A study will be included if it meets the following criteria: (1) involves a defined environmental exposure in the P0/F0 generation in *C. elegans*, *D. melanogaster*, *M. musculus*, or *A. thaliana*; (2) includes molecular profiling of an unexposed F2 or later generation (F3 for mammals to rigorously exclude direct germline exposure); (3) provides publicly available raw sequencing data for at least one relevant modality (e.g., BS-seq, ChIP-seq, sRNA-seq, RNA-seq); and (4) includes a concurrently maintained, unexposed control lineage.\n*   **Metadata Schema:** For each included study, we will extract and standardize a rich set of metadata, including species, strain, stimulus type, dose, duration, sex of exposed parent, tissue type, and sequencing technology. This curated metadata will be essential for subsequent stratified analyses and will be made publicly available.\n\n**Phase 2: Standardized Multi-Omic Re-analysis Pipelines (Months 4-15)**\nA critical flaw in previous narrative reviews is the comparison of results generated with different bioinformatics methods. To overcome this, we will re-process all raw sequencing data from scratch using a suite of standardized, state-of-the-art analysis pipelines.\n*   **Reproducible Workflows:** We will develop and implement a series of containerized (Docker/Singularity) workflows using Nextflow, a portable and scalable workflow manager. This ensures absolute reproducibility and allows for efficient deployment on both local high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and cloud infrastructure. Separate pipelines will be optimized for each data type:\n    *   **BS-seq/WGBS:** Quality control (FastQC/TrimGalore), alignment and methylation calling (Bismark), and identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using a consistent statistical model (e.g., methylKit).\n    *   **ChIP-seq:** QC, alignment (BWA-MEM), peak calling (MACS2), and differential binding analysis (DiffBind) to identify regions with significant changes in histone modifications.\n    *   **sRNA-seq:** QC, adapter trimming, alignment to the genome and RNA databases (miRBase, piRNAdb), quantification of known and novel small RNAs, and differential expression analysis (DESeq2).\n    *   **RNA-seq:** QC, alignment (STAR), gene/transcript quantification (RSEM), and differential expression analysis (DESeq2).\n*   **Open Source Commitment:** All analysis pipelines, scripts, and associated documentation will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub from the project's inception.\n\n**Phase 3: Cross-Species Integrative Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Months 12-24)**\nThis phase represents the core synthesis effort, where we will integrate the harmonized analysis results to test our hypotheses.\n*   **Orthology Mapping:** To enable direct cross-species comparisons, we will map genes between the four species using the OrthoDB database, focusing on one-to-one orthologs to ensure high confidence.\n*   **Testing H1 (Conserved Carrier):** We will search for conserved classes of sncRNAs that are differentially expressed in F2/F3 generations across species. We will then use target prediction algorithms (e.g., TargetScan, miRanda) to determine if these heritable sncRNAs are predicted to regulate orthologous genes that also show heritable changes in expression or chromatin state, thereby linking the carrier to its putative target.\n*   **Testing H2 (Genomic Loci):** Using TE annotations from RepeatMasker, we will perform permutation-based enrichment tests to determine if DMRs or differential ChIP-seq peaks are significantly co-localized with specific TE families. This analysis will be performed for each species and then compared across species to identify conserved associations.\n*   **Testing H3 (Stimulus-Response):** We will classify all experimental stimuli into broad categories ('Metabolic', 'Toxicant', 'Psychological Stress', etc.). For each category, we will perform Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses on the sets of orthologous genes showing heritable changes. A significant overlap in enriched pathways across species for a given stimulus category would support our hypothesis.\n*   **Network-Based Integration:** We will construct multi-layered networks where nodes are orthologous genes and edges represent different types of evidence for TGEI (e.g., differential expression, differential methylation). We will use network analysis algorithms to identify conserved modules and hub genes that represent the core machinery of TGEI.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Completion of data curation and metadata database (M6); Deployment of all analysis pipelines and completion of pilot re-analyses (M9); Completion of all single-species re-analyses (M12).\n*   **Year 2:** Completion of cross-species orthology mapping and initial integrative analyses (M18); Final hypothesis testing, network analysis, and manuscript drafting (M21); Public launch of data portal and submission of primary manuscript (M24).\n*   **Collaboration:** The working group will meet in person twice annually, supplemented by monthly video conferences to ensure tight integration, troubleshoot challenges, and provide training opportunities for junior members.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to make transformative contributions to the field of epigenetics and our broader understanding of inheritance. The expected outcomes are designed to provide not only novel scientific insights but also lasting resources for the entire research community, directly aligning with the NCEMS mission to catalyze synthesis in the molecular and cellular biosciences.\n\n**Intellectual Merit and Contributions to the Field:**\nThe primary outcome will be the first-ever systematic, quantitative synthesis of the molecular evidence for TGEI across major eukaryotic model organisms. This will elevate the field from a collection of disparate observations to a data-driven science. We will produce a definitive, cross-species catalog of the genes, pathways, and genomic regions that are hotspots for heritable epigenetic change. By identifying conserved molecular signatures—such as specific small RNA pathways or histone modifications on transposable elements—we will provide a robust, mechanistic framework for TGEI. This will resolve long-standing debates about the existence and nature of epigenetic inheritance and provide a concrete foundation for future, hypothesis-driven experimental work. Furthermore, our development and dissemination of standardized, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines will establish a new gold standard for rigor in the field, enhancing the reliability of future studies.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe implications of this research extend far beyond basic science. In **public health**, understanding the mechanisms of TGEI is critical for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm. Our findings could reveal how parental exposures to environmental factors like malnutrition, pollution, and stress are molecularly encoded and transmitted, potentially influencing offspring risk for chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders. This knowledge could inform novel public health interventions and preventative strategies aimed at breaking intergenerational cycles of disease. In **toxicology and environmental risk assessment**, our work could provide the scientific basis for incorporating transgenerational effects into regulatory frameworks for chemical safety, which currently do not consider heritable impacts beyond direct DNA mutation. In **evolutionary biology**, this project will provide crucial evidence for a non-genetic mode of inheritance that could facilitate rapid adaptation to changing environments, a topic of intense interest in the context of global climate change.\n\n**Dissemination, Data Sharing, and Open Science:**\nWe are deeply committed to the principles of open, team, and reproducible science. All analysis pipelines and code will be shared via a public GitHub repository. The central deliverable of this project, beyond publications, will be the creation of a **TGEI Synthesis Data Portal**. This publicly accessible web resource will serve as a lasting legacy, providing the community with:\n1.  A searchable, curated database of TGEI studies and their experimental metadata.\n2.  Access to all harmonized, re-analyzed data, including differential expression/methylation lists and browser tracks.\n3.  Interactive visualization tools to explore conserved genes, pathways, and epigenetic signatures across species and stimuli.\nOur findings will be disseminated through high-impact, open-access publications, presentations at major international conferences (e.g., Gordon Research Conference on Epigenetics, CSHL Meetings), and a final project workshop aimed at training the broader community on our methods and data portal.\n\n**Training and Collaboration:**\nThis working group is an ideal environment for training the next generation of data-savvy biologists. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the project, gaining invaluable cross-disciplinary experience in computational biology, data integration, and collaborative team science. They will lead sub-projects, co-author papers, and present their work, preparing them for leadership roles in modern, data-intensive biological research. The collaborative structure of the working group, bringing together experts from different institutions, career stages, and scientific backgrounds, is essential for the project's success and embodies the spirit of the NCEMS research call.",
        "budget_and_resources": "The proposed research represents a large-scale synthesis effort that is beyond the capabilities of any single research laboratory and requires the dedicated, coordinated effort of a multidisciplinary team. The need to collate, curate, and uniformly re-analyze hundreds of complex sequencing datasets from four different species necessitates a level of focused personnel time and computational infrastructure that cannot be supported by traditional R01-type funding mechanisms. This project is fundamentally about integration and synthesis, making it an ideal fit for the NCEMS Working Group program. The budget is designed to support the personnel, collaborative activities, and computational resources essential for achieving our ambitious goals over a two-year period.\n\n**Budget Justification:**\n\n**A.

        "background_and_significance": "Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, is a fundamental biological process with a paradoxical role in health and disease. Initially described as a limit to cellular proliferation in vitro, it is now recognized as a critical tumor suppression mechanism and an essential component of tissue repair and embryonic development. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age is also a major driver of organismal aging and a contributor to a wide range of age-related pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. This dual functionality highlights the complexity and context-dependency of the senescent phenotype, an emergent property arising from intricate molecular networks. The canonical markers used to identify senescent cells—such as senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, expression of cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p21CIP1, and the formation of DNA damage foci—are often inconsistent and lack specificity. Furthermore, a key feature of many senescent cells is the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a complex secretome of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases that can profoundly alter the tissue microenvironment. The composition of the SASP is highly variable, depending on the cell type and the senescence-inducing stressor. This heterogeneity is the central challenge in the field. Recent large-scale data generation efforts have provided tantalizing glimpses into this complexity. Projects like the Tabula Muris Senis have generated single-cell transcriptomic data across the lifespan of mice, revealing age-associated shifts in cell populations that are likely related to senescence. Similarly, proteomic studies have begun to catalog the diversity of the SASP, while high-content imaging screens have documented the profound morphological changes that accompany the senescent transition. However, these valuable datasets remain largely siloed. Transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging, and epigenomic data are typically analyzed in isolation, preventing a holistic understanding of the senescent state. We lack a systematic framework to connect a cell's gene expression program to its morphology, its secretome, and its spatial interactions within a tissue. This fragmentation of knowledge represents a major gap in the field. It prevents the identification of robust, universal biomarkers of senescence and hampers the rational design of senotherapeutics—drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells. The lack of an integrated model means we cannot reliably distinguish between potentially beneficial and pathogenic senescent cells, a critical distinction for therapeutic intervention. This research is both important and timely. With global populations aging rapidly, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging is a paramount public health challenge. Senolytics are already advancing into clinical trials, yet our incomplete understanding of senescence heterogeneity poses a significant risk, as indiscriminate removal of all senescent cells could have unintended negative consequences. The recent explosion in publicly available multi-omics and imaging data, coupled with advances in machine learning and data integration algorithms, creates an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge. A community-scale synthesis effort, as proposed here, is now feasible and necessary to unify these disparate data streams into a coherent model. This project directly addresses the emergent nature of senescence by integrating data across biological scales, a task beyond the scope of any single lab and perfectly aligned with the NCEMS mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to solve fundamental questions in biosciences.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to construct a multi-scale, integrated 'Senescence Atlas' that systematically defines the core principles and context-dependent heterogeneity of cellular senescence. This atlas will serve as a predictive model of the senescent state, linking molecular programs to cellular morphology and tissue-level function. To achieve this, our working group will address four fundamental research questions.\n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can we establish a comprehensive molecular taxonomy of senescent cell subtypes by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data across diverse tissues, species, and senescence inducers?**\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** Senescent cells can be classified into a finite set of distinct, transcriptionally-defined subtypes that represent core functional programs (e.g., 'pro-inflammatory,' 'pro-fibrotic,' 'immunosuppressive'), and these subtypes are conserved across different biological contexts.\n*   **Hypothesis 1b:** These transcriptional subtypes are governed by specific and recurring patterns of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, which serve as a stable epigenetic memory of the senescent state.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will apply unsupervised clustering algorithms to integrated single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets from public repositories. Subtypes will be defined by robust marker genes and regulatory elements. We will validate the taxonomy by training a machine learning classifier on a subset of the data and testing its ability to accurately classify cells in independent datasets. The expected deliverable is a hierarchical classification of senescence subtypes with detailed molecular signatures.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): Can deep learning models trained on high-resolution imaging data accurately identify senescent cells and do their morphological phenotypes correlate with defined molecular subtypes?**\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to distinguish senescent from non-senescent cells with high accuracy (>90%) based solely on morphological features (e.g., cell size, nuclear shape, organelle texture) extracted from microscopy images.\n*   **Hypothesis 2b:** The quantitative morphological features learned by the CNN will correlate significantly with the molecular subtypes defined in RQ1, establishing a direct link between gene expression programs and the physical phenotype of the cell.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will curate and annotate a large image dataset of senescent and control cells from the Image Data Resource and other public sources. A CNN will be trained and rigorously validated using cross-validation. To test H2b, we will identify datasets with paired imaging and transcriptomic data, allowing us to directly correlate the model's morphological classifications with molecular profiles using statistical methods. The deliverable is a validated, open-source image analysis pipeline for senescence detection.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): How does the composition of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) vary across molecular subtypes, and what are the core regulatory networks controlling its expression?**\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The SASP is not a single entity but comprises distinct modules of secreted factors, and the expression of these modules is tightly coupled to specific molecular subtypes of senescent cells.\n*   **Hypothesis 3b:** By integrating proteomic data of the secretome with transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we can identify key transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, C/EBPβ) and signaling pathways that act as master regulators for different SASP modules.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will integrate public proteomic datasets of senescent secretomes with our molecular subtype definitions. We will use weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-secreted proteins and correlate them with subtypes. We will perform transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis on the regulatory regions of SASP genes to validate regulatory hypotheses. The outcome will be a comprehensive map linking SASP composition to cell subtype and its underlying regulatory network.\n\n**Research Question 4 (RQ4): How are senescent cell subtypes spatially organized within tissues, and how do they interact with their microenvironment to drive emergent phenotypes like chronic inflammation?**\n*   **Hypothesis 4a:** The spatial distribution of senescent cells in tissues is non-random, with specific subtypes preferentially localizing to distinct tissue niches or in proximity to particular cell types (e.g., immune cells).\n*   **Hypothesis 4b:** The identity and spatial arrangement of senescent subtypes and their neighbors can predict the local tissue state (e.g., inflammation, fibrosis, immune surveillance), revealing the rules of their collective behavior.\n*   **Testing and Validation:** We will leverage public spatial transcriptomics datasets. Using our molecular signatures from RQ1, we will deconvolve the identity and location of senescent subtypes. We will then apply spatial statistics to test for non-random co-localization patterns and use ligand-receptor interaction modeling to map potential signaling networks in situ. The deliverable will be a set of 'interaction maps' detailing the social context of different senescent subtypes.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary working group comprising experts in computational biology, gerontology, computer vision, and spatial omics. The collaborative structure, facilitated by NCEMS, is essential for integrating the diverse data types and analytical approaches required. Our approach is organized around a 3-year timeline with clear milestones and deliverables, all adhering to open science principles.\n\n**Working Group Structure and Collaboration:** The project will be co-led by four PIs from different institutions, ensuring a diversity of perspectives. The team will include two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students who will work across labs, fostering a deeply collaborative and interdisciplinary training environment. Collaboration will be managed through weekly virtual meetings, quarterly in-person workshops hosted by NCEMS, a shared Slack channel for daily communication, and a centralized GitHub organization for all code and analysis pipelines. This structure demonstrates a clear need for NCEMS support to facilitate a level of interaction beyond a standard multi-PI grant.\n\n**Data Acquisition and Curation (Milestone 1: Months 1-6):** Our first major task is to build a comprehensive, curated database of publicly available senescence-related data. We will systematically mine repositories including NCBI GEO, SRA, ENCODE, ProteomeXchange, Image Data Resource (IDR), and the Human Cell Atlas. A standardized metadata schema will be developed to capture critical experimental variables (species, tissue, cell type, senescence inducer, protocol). Datasets will include:\n*   **Transcriptomics:** Over 100 single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets from aged or diseased tissues (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis) and numerous bulk RNA-seq datasets from in vitro senescence models.\n*   **Epigenomics:** Publicly available scATAC-seq, CUT&RUN, and ChIP-seq data for key histone marks (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K9me3) and DNA methylation arrays from well-characterized senescent systems.\n*   **Proteomics:** Mass spectrometry datasets of conditioned media from senescent cells cataloged in ProteomeXchange and other repositories.\n*   **Imaging:** High-content microscopy screens from IDR and other sources, featuring morphological and marker-based staining of senescent cells.\n*   **Spatial Omics:** Public Visium, MIBI-TOF, and MERFISH datasets from tissues known to accumulate senescent cells, such as fibrotic lung and aged skin.\n*   **Deliverable:** A public, searchable catalog of all curated datasets with standardized metadata.\n\n**Analytical Plan:**\n*   **Aim 1: Molecular Subtype Definition (Milestone 2: Months 7-18):** We will develop and apply a standardized computational pipeline for processing all transcriptomic and epigenomic data. Data integration will be performed using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Harmony, Seurat v4) to correct for batch effects. We will then use graph-based clustering (e.g., Leiden) on the integrated latent space to identify putative senescent subtypes. These subtypes will be characterized by identifying differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns. The robustness of the subtypes will be validated across datasets and species.\n*   **Aim 2: Morphological Phenotyping (Milestone 3: Months 7-24):** Images will be preprocessed using a pipeline built with CellProfiler and Python libraries. We will employ a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) on our annotated image dataset to classify cells. The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated. We will use explainable AI techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) to identify the key morphological features driving classification. These features will then be statistically correlated with the molecular subtypes from Aim 1 using datasets where both data types are available.\n*   **Aim 3: SASP Characterization (Milestone 4: Months 12-30):** Proteomic data will be re-analyzed through a uniform pipeline to ensure comparability. We will map secreted proteins to their genes and test for the enrichment of specific protein sets within our transcriptomic subtypes. Regulatory network inference tools (e.g., SCENIC) will be applied to the integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic data to identify transcription factors that regulate subtype-specific SASP modules.\n*   **Aim 4: Spatial Analysis (Milestone 5: Months 18-36):** We will use our molecular subtype signatures as a reference to deconvolve the spatial locations of senescent cells in spatial transcriptomics data using tools like cell2location. Following deconvolution, we will apply a suite of spatial statistics tools (e.g., from the `squidpy` library) to analyze neighborhood compositions, cell-cell interactions, and niche organization. Ligand-receptor modeling will predict signaling pathways active between senescent cells and their microenvironment.\n\n**Timeline and Open Science:**\n*   **Year 1:** Data curation, pipeline development, initial molecular subtype definition, and image model training.\n*   **Year 2:** Refinement of subtypes, integration with proteomics and imaging, and initial spatial analysis.\n*   **Year 3:** Final multi-modal integration, construction of the interactive Senescence Atlas web portal, manuscript preparation, and community workshops.\nAll code will be developed openly on GitHub with version control. All processed data, analysis results, and trained models will be deposited in public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Model Zoo) with detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility and community reuse.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project will generate transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the fields of aging biology, cell biology, and translational medicine. Its impact will be felt through the creation of a foundational public resource, the generation of novel biological insights, the development of new analytical tools, and the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.\n\n**Intended Contributions to the Field:**\n1.  **The Senescence Atlas:** The primary deliverable will be a first-of-its-kind, multi-scale 'Senescence Atlas,' delivered as an open-access, interactive web portal. This will not be a static repository but a dynamic knowledge base allowing researchers to explore the connections between genes, proteins, cell morphologies, and tissue locations across dozens of contexts. It will become an indispensable resource for the aging research community, analogous to resources like the Human Cell Atlas or the ENCODE portal.\n2.  **A Data-Driven Taxonomy of Senescence:** We will replace the current ambiguous and qualitative descriptions of senescence with a robust, quantitative classification of senescent subtypes. This new taxonomy, based on the integration of thousands of data points, will provide a common language for the field, resolve long-standing controversies, and allow for the re-interpretation of previous studies in a new, more precise context.\n3.  **Robust, Multi-Modal Biomarkers:** By identifying the core molecular and morphological features that are conserved across different senescent subtypes and contexts, this project will deliver a panel of validated, high-confidence biomarkers. This will overcome a major bottleneck in the field, enabling more reliable detection and quantification of senescent cells in both research and clinical settings.\n4.  **A Novel Integrative Analytical Framework:** We will develop and disseminate a powerful, open-source computational workflow for synthesizing multi-modal biological data (genomics, proteomics, imaging, spatial-omics). This framework will be a valuable resource in itself, adaptable by other researchers to study different complex biological phenomena characterized by heterogeneity and emergent properties.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\n*   **Accelerating Senotherapeutics:** Our findings will have a direct and immediate impact on the development of drugs targeting senescent cells. By defining subtype-specific vulnerabilities and SASP profiles, the atlas will enable the design of next-generation, precision senolytics that can target pathogenic senescent cells while sparing those with beneficial functions. This will lead to more effective and safer therapies for a host of age-related diseases.\n*   **Enhancing Diagnostics:** The machine learning models for image-based senescence detection have the potential to be translated into digital pathology tools. This could provide clinicians with a quantitative, automated method to assess senescent cell burden in patient biopsies, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of treatment response.\n*   **Training and Workforce Development:** This project is intrinsically designed to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interface of biology, data science, and machine learning. Through the NCEMS working group model, trainees will gain invaluable experience in large-scale data analysis, collaborative team science, and open-source software development, preparing them to be leaders in the future data-driven biomedical workforce.\n\n**Dissemination and Long-Term Vision:**\nOur commitment to open science will ensure maximum impact. We will publish our findings in high-impact, open-access journals. The Senescence Atlas web portal will be our primary means of dissemination to the research community. We will actively promote its use through presentations at major international conferences (e.g., GSA, ASCB, ISMB) and by hosting hands-on workshops to train users. The atlas is envisioned as a living resource, designed with a flexible architecture to incorporate new public datasets as they become available. We will seek follow-on funding to ensure its long-term maintenance and expansion, establishing a permanent, community-driven resource that will catalyze research and discovery in aging biology for many years to come.",

A multidisciplinary working group will integrate several key public datasets: 1) The comprehensive FANTOM and ENCODE compendia of lncRNA expression and chromatin states across cell types; 2) eCLIP and RIP-seq data identifying the proteins that bind to lncRNAs; 3) Chromatin interaction data (Hi-C, ChIA-PET) to link lncRNAs to their potential gene targets in 3D space; and 4) RNA secondary structure predictions and probing data. The team will develop a multi-layered network model where lncRNAs, proteins, and target genes are nodes connected by different types of functional evidence. By applying network propagation algorithms and machine learning, we will: a) Cluster lncRNAs into functional modules based on shared properties (e.g., binding proteins, subcellular localization, target pathways); b) Predict whether a lncRNA acts as a 'scaffold', 'guide', 'decoy', or 'enhancer'; and c) Generate high-confidence hypotheses for thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs. This will produce a foundational resource, the 'lncRNA Functional Atlas,' to guide experimental research into the non-coding genome.",
        "background_and_significance": "The central dogma of molecular biology has long focused on the flow of genetic information from DNA to protein. However, the completion of the human genome project and subsequent large-scale transcriptomic studies, such as those by the ENCODE and FANTOM consortia, revealed a surprising reality: the vast majority of the genome is pervasively transcribed, yet less than 2% codes for proteins. This discovery unveiled a massive, uncharted territory of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among the most abundant and enigmatic of these are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with no significant protein-coding potential. Tens of thousands of lncRNAs have been annotated, and their expression is often highly specific to cell type, developmental stage, and disease state, strongly implying functional relevance. Seminal studies on a few select lncRNAs have provided tantalizing glimpses into their diverse molecular roles. For instance, *XIST* orchestrates X-chromosome inactivation by coating the chromosome and recruiting silencing complexes. *HOTAIR* acts as a molecular scaffold, bridging polycomb repressive complexes to target gene loci to regulate chromatin state. *MALAT1* functions within nuclear speckles to modulate alternative splicing, while *GAS5* acts as a 'decoy' by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor to prevent its action on DNA. These examples establish four key mechanistic archetypes—guide, scaffold, decoy, and enhancer—demonstrating that lncRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression at multiple levels. Despite these advances, a monumental gap in our knowledge persists. Fewer than 1% of annotated human lncRNAs have been functionally characterized. This knowledge gap represents a major bottleneck in understanding genome function, cellular physiology, and the molecular basis of human disease. Current computational approaches to predict lncRNA function are often limited in scope. Many rely on a 'guilt-by-association' principle, inferring function from co-expression with protein-coding genes. Others focus on genomic context, such as proximity to known genes. While useful, these methods fail to integrate the rich, multi-modal data that describe the molecular life of a lncRNA—whom it binds, where it localizes, its 3D genomic context, and its structure. There is no systematic framework to synthesize these disparate data types to understand the underlying 'rules' or 'grammar' that govern lncRNA function. The research community lacks a comprehensive resource that provides high-confidence, mechanistically-grounded hypotheses for the thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs. This project is both important and timely because we are at a unique confluence of data availability and analytical capability. The explosion of publicly available datasets—including genome-wide maps of RNA-protein interactions (eCLIP), 3D chromatin architecture (Hi-C), and chromatin states—provides an unprecedented opportunity for data synthesis. This project proposes to seize this opportunity by assembling a multidisciplinary working group to integrate these datasets into a unified computational framework. By doing so, we will move beyond simple correlation to build a predictive model of lncRNA function. This work is critical for prioritizing experimental studies, uncovering novel biological pathways, and ultimately understanding the role of the non-coding genome in health and disease, directly addressing the core mission of this research call to solve fundamental puzzles in molecular biology through community-scale data synthesis.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that systematically deciphers the functional grammar of human lncRNAs by integrating multi-modal genomic and transcriptomic data. To achieve this, we will address three central research questions, each associated with specific, testable hypotheses.\n\n**Research Question 1: Can lncRNAs be systematically classified into functional modules based on the integrated signatures of their molecular interactions, expression patterns, and genomic context?**\nThis question addresses the fundamental principle of biological organization, where molecules with related functions often operate in coordinated modules. We hypothesize that lncRNAs do not function in isolation but as part of larger ribonucleoprotein complexes and regulatory networks.\n*   **Hypothesis 1a:** LncRNAs that share similar sets of interacting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), exhibit correlated expression patterns with specific protein-coding genes, and share subcellular localizations will participate in common biological pathways or cellular processes.\n*   **Prediction:** Our multi-layered network model, which integrates these data types, will reveal distinct, statistically significant clusters (modules) of lncRNAs, proteins, and genes. We predict that the protein-coding genes within a given module will show significant enrichment for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways, thereby imputing a putative function to the co-clustered, uncharacterized lncRNAs.\n*   **Validation:** We will validate these module assignments by assessing their consistency with existing knowledge. We will test whether the few well-characterized lncRNAs within a module have functions consistent with the module's overall enrichment score. Furthermore, we will use external datasets, such as phenotype data from lncRNA knockdown screens, to check if perturbing lncRNAs from the same predicted module results in similar cellular phenotypes.\n\n**Research Question 2: Can a predictive model be developed to classify the primary molecular mechanism of uncharacterized lncRNAs into established archetypes (scaffold, guide, decoy, enhancer)?**\nThis question moves from 'what' a lncRNA does (its biological process) to 'how' it does it (its molecular mechanism). We aim to define the quantitative features that distinguish different functional classes.\n*   **Hypothesis 2a:** Different lncRNA functional archetypes possess distinct, quantifiable multi-omic features. For example, 'scaffold' lncRNAs will have a high degree of RBP binding complexity and specific structural motifs; 'guide' lncRNAs will show strong interactions with chromatin-modifying enzymes and co-localize with their genomic targets in 3D space; 'decoy' lncRNAs will bind specific proteins (like transcription factors) with high affinity but lack other features; and 'enhancer' lncRNAs will originate from regions with active enhancer chromatin marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) and physically loop to target gene promoters.\n*   **Prediction:** A machine learning classifier trained on a feature set derived from our integrated network can accurately assign uncharacterized lncRNAs to one of these mechanistic classes.\n*   **Validation:** We will curate a 'gold standard' training set of well-characterized lncRNAs with established mechanisms. The performance of our classifier will be rigorously evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, measuring metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall. The model's feature importance scores will reveal which data types are most informative for predicting each mechanism, providing insights into the functional grammar itself.\n\n**Research Question 3: How can the cis- and trans-acting gene targets of lncRNAs be accurately predicted on a genome-wide scale?**\nIdentifying the downstream genes regulated by a lncRNA is crucial for understanding its ultimate biological impact.\n*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The true regulatory targets of a lncRNA are identifiable through the convergence of multiple independent lines of evidence, including genomic proximity (for cis-acting lncRNAs), significant 3D chromatin looping interactions (from Hi-C/ChIA-PET), and robust expression correlation across diverse cellular contexts.\n*   **Prediction:** A network propagation algorithm initiated from a specific lncRNA node in our multi-layered network will identify high-confidence protein-coding gene targets. We predict that these computationally-derived targets will be significantly enriched for genes whose expression changes following experimental perturbation of the source lncRNA, based on publicly available CRISPRi/knockdown screen data.\n*   **Validation:** We will benchmark our predictions against curated databases of experimentally validated lncRNA-target interactions (e.g., LncTarD). We will also perform a systematic analysis using data from projects like DECODE, testing whether our predicted targets show the expected expression changes upon lncRNA depletion. This provides a large-scale, albeit indirect, validation of our approach.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed in three distinct but interconnected phases, leveraging a transdisciplinary approach to data integration, network modeling, and machine learning. Our methodology is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and fully aligned with open science principles.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Processing, and Harmonization (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on assembling and standardizing the diverse public datasets required for our synthesis. All data will be uniformly mapped to the hg38 human genome assembly and GENCODE v38 gene annotations to ensure consistency.\n*   **Data Sources:** We will systematically download data from major public repositories including ENCODE, FANTOM, GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics, and the 4D Nucleome portal. Key datasets include: \n    1.  **LncRNA Expression & Annotation:** RNA-seq data from ENCODE and GTEx across hundreds of cell types and tissues; CAGE-seq data from FANTOM5/6 for precise transcription start site identification.\n    2.  **RNA-Protein Interactions:** All available eCLIP datasets from ENCODE (~200 RBPs) will be reprocessed using a uniform peak-calling pipeline (e.g., CLIPper) to generate a consistent map of RBP binding sites on lncRNA transcripts.\n    3.  **Chromatin State & Accessibility:** Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for key histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) and ATAC-seq/DNase-seq data will be used to define the chromatin context of lncRNA loci.\n    4.  **3D Chromatin Architecture:** High-resolution in situ Hi-C data will be processed using tools like Juicer to identify significant chromatin loops. Where available, targeted interaction data (ChIA-PET, HiChIP) will be used to map promoter-centric interactions.\n    5.  **Subcellular Localization:** RNA-seq data from cellular fractionation experiments (e.g., nuclear, cytoplasmic, chromatin-associated) from ENCODE will be used to determine the primary location of each lncRNA.\n*   **Data Harmonization:** A critical step will be the development of a standardized computational pipeline to process each data type, control for technical variability, and generate analysis-ready data matrices and interaction lists. This pipeline will be version-controlled and made publicly available on GitHub.\n\n**Phase 2: Construction of the Multi-Layered LncRNA Network (Months 7-12)**\nWe will construct a heterogeneous graph, a powerful data structure for representing complex biological relationships. The network will consist of three types of nodes (lncRNAs, proteins/RBPs, protein-coding genes) and multiple types of edges, each representing a different layer of biological evidence.\n*   **Network Layers (Edge Types):**\n    1.  **LncRNA-Protein Binding:** Weighted edges based on eCLIP peak significance.\n    2.  **LncRNA-Gene Co-expression:** Weighted edges representing significant expression correlation across tissues/cell lines.\n    3.  **LncRNA-Gene Chromatin Interaction:** Edges connecting lncRNA promoters to gene promoters via significant Hi-C loops.\n    4.  **LncRNA-Gene Genomic Adjacency:** Edges connecting lncRNAs to their nearest neighboring genes in cis.\n    5.  **Protein-Protein Interaction:** Edges from the STRING database to provide context on RBP complexes.\n*   **Implementation:** The network will be implemented in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to allow for efficient querying and complex pattern analysis. Each edge will be annotated with its source evidence and confidence score.\n\n**Phase 3: Network Analysis, Prediction, and Hypothesis Generation (Months 13-30)**\nThis phase involves applying computational algorithms to the integrated network to address our core research questions.\n*   **Aim 1 (Functional Module Discovery):** We will employ community detection algorithms, such as the Louvain method, on the integrated network. This will partition the network into modules of densely interconnected nodes. For each module, we will perform functional enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways) on its constituent proteins and genes to assign a putative biological function to the entire module, including its uncharacterized lncRNAs.\n*   **Aim 2 (Mechanistic Classification):** We will use a supervised machine learning approach. First, we will perform feature engineering, creating a rich feature vector for each lncRNA from the network and source data (e.g., RBP binding profile, network topology metrics, chromatin state signature, structural properties). Second, we will train a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model on our curated 'gold standard' set of lncRNAs with known mechanisms. The trained model will then be used to predict the mechanistic class for thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs.\n*   **Aim 3 (Target Gene Prediction):** We will use a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm. Starting from a lncRNA node, the RWR simulates a 'walker' that traverses the network, with the final probability of landing on any given protein-coding gene node representing the predicted strength of the regulatory link. This method effectively integrates all paths and types of evidence connecting a lncRNA to a potential target.\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n*   **Year 1:** Complete data acquisition and processing (M6); Construct and validate the multi-layered network (M12).\n*   **Year 2:** Complete functional module discovery and analysis (M18); Develop and benchmark the mechanistic classifier and target prediction algorithms (M24); Launch beta version of the lncRNA Functional Atlas web portal.\n*   **Year 3:** Generate genome-wide predictions (M30); Submit primary manuscripts for publication (M32); Public launch and dissemination of the lncRNA Functional Atlas (M34); Final reporting (M36).",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is designed to produce a suite of transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of non-coding RNA biology and provide a lasting resource for the broader scientific community. The impact will span from generating fundamental knowledge about genome function to enabling new avenues of translational research.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n1.  **The lncRNA Functional Atlas:** The principal deliverable will be a comprehensive, publicly accessible web portal and data repository. This Atlas will be the first-of-its-kind resource, providing integrated, multi-evidence-based functional predictions for thousands of human lncRNAs. For any lncRNA of interest, a user will be able to retrieve its predicted biological process (from module analysis), its likely molecular mechanism (from the classifier), a ranked list of its putative gene targets, and a visualization of all supporting evidence (e.g., eCLIP peaks, Hi-C loops). This will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for researchers wishing to study lncRNAs, effectively providing a functional annotation for a large part of the non-coding genome.\n2.  **A Validated Computational Framework:** We will deliver a robust, open-source, and reproducible computational pipeline for integrating multi-omic data to predict lncRNA function. This framework itself is a significant contribution, as it can be adapted by other researchers and extended to incorporate new data types or to study lncRNAs in other species.\n3.  **A Catalog of High-Confidence Hypotheses:** The project will generate thousands of specific, mechanistically-grounded, and testable hypotheses. For example: 'lncRNA-A acts as a scaffold for splicing factors X and Y to regulate the alternative splicing of gene Z in neurons.' These high-confidence predictions will serve as a roadmap for the experimental community, allowing them to focus their low-throughput, resource-intensive validation efforts on the most promising candidates, thereby accelerating the pace of discovery.\n4.  **New Insights into the 'Functional Grammar' of lncRNAs:** By analyzing which features are most predictive of specific functions, our work will uncover the underlying principles that govern how lncRNA sequence and structure translate into biological roles. This will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding the non-coding genome.\n\n**Broader Impact and Applications:**\n*   **Impact on Molecular and Cellular Biology:** This project addresses a fundamental question in biology: what is the function of the non-coding genome? By providing a systematic functional map, our work will enable the discovery of novel regulatory pathways and networks that govern cellular identity, differentiation, and response to stimuli.\n*   **Translational and Clinical Relevance:** LncRNAs are increasingly implicated as key players in human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. The lncRNA Functional Atlas will provide immediate functional context for disease-associated lncRNAs identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or clinical sequencing. This can help pinpoint causal mechanisms and reveal novel points for therapeutic intervention, such as developing antisense oligonucleotides to target a lncRNA that scaffolds an oncogenic protein complex.\n*   **Alignment with NCEMS Mission:** This project epitomizes the goals of the NCEMS research call. It is a community-scale synthesis project that uses only publicly available data to solve a long-standing puzzle. It requires a transdisciplinary team, promotes open science through its public Atlas and open-source code, and includes a clear plan for training graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge data science.\n\n**Dissemination Plan:**\nOur dissemination strategy is multi-pronged to ensure maximum impact. The lncRNA Functional Atlas will be our primary vehicle for broad community access. We will submit our findings for publication in high-impact, open-access journals. All code will be shared on GitHub with extensive documentation and tutorials. Finally, we will present our work at major international conferences (e.g., RNA Society, ISMB) and organize workshops to train the community on using our resources, ensuring the project's legacy and fostering future collaborations.",

        "background_and_significance": "The ability of a cell to sense, respond, and adapt to environmental stress is a fundamental property of life. From bacteria to humans, organisms are equipped with sophisticated molecular networks that mitigate damage and ensure survival in the face of insults such as temperature shifts, nutrient scarcity, oxidative damage, and exposure to toxins. For decades, molecular and cellular biology has successfully dissected individual stress response pathways in remarkable detail. Seminal research has elucidated the Heat Shock Response (HSR) governed by HSF1, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that monitors proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the DNA Damage Response (DDR) orchestrated by kinases like ATM and ATR, and the Oxidative Stress Response mediated by transcription factors like Nrf2/SKN-1. These studies have provided a deep, yet fragmented, understanding of cellular defense mechanisms. Typically, they focus on a single stressor, a single pathway, and often a single model organism. This reductionist approach, while powerful, has created a significant knowledge gap: we lack a holistic, systems-level understanding of how these distinct pathways are integrated to produce a coherent, robust cellular response. Early genomic studies, such as the landmark work by Gasch et al. (2000) in yeast, revealed a common 'Environmental Stress Response' (ESR), a shared transcriptional program activated by diverse stressors. This provided the first glimpse that beneath stressor-specific adaptations lies a more universal, core program. However, these early studies were limited by the available data and analytical tools. They could not fully decompose the response into its constituent parts, identify the master regulators coordinating the network across different stress types, or generalize these findings across diverse eukaryotic species. Today, we are at a critical juncture. Public data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and the Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE) have become vast digital libraries, housing hundreds of thousands of datasets from experiments probing cellular responses to a myriad of perturbations. Concurrently, advances in computational biology, data science, and machine learning have equipped us with powerful tools for data integration, network inference, and predictive modeling. The time is therefore ripe for a community-scale synthesis effort to integrate this wealth of existing data and address fundamental questions about the emergent property of cellular resilience. This research is critically important because a fragmented understanding of stress responses limits our ability to tackle complex biological problems. Chronic, unresolved cellular stress is a unifying feature of aging and a wide range of human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases (proteotoxic stress), cancer (genotoxic and metabolic stress), and cardiovascular disease (oxidative stress). A systems-level map of the stress response network would provide a powerful framework for understanding the common molecular underpinnings of these disparate diseases. Furthermore, in toxicology and environmental science, we need better methods to predict the cellular impact of the thousands of novel chemicals introduced into our environment. By uncovering the universal principles of stress adaptation, this project will not only solve a long-standing puzzle in fundamental cell biology but also provide actionable insights with broad translational and societal impact. This proposal directly aligns with the research call's mission to catalyze multidisciplinary teams to synthesize public data, answer novel questions about emergence phenomena, and train the next generation of data-savvy biologists.",
        "research_questions_and_hypotheses": "This research project is designed to transition the study of cellular stress from a collection of individual pathways to an integrated, systems-level science. Our central goal is to define the universal organizational principles of the eukaryotic stress response by synthesizing a massive corpus of public transcriptomic and proteomic data. We will address this goal through three specific, interconnected research questions, each with a corresponding testable hypothesis. \n\n**Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can the global cellular response to diverse environmental stressors be computationally decomposed into a conserved, 'core' functional program and a set of stressor-specific 'peripheral' modules?**\nWe hypothesize that a substantial and identifiable component of the molecular response is common across a wide array of stressors, constituting a 'Core Stress Response' (CSR). This CSR represents a general survival strategy. We predict this core module will be highly conserved across yeast, flies, worms, and human cells and will be functionally enriched for fundamental processes such as protein quality control (chaperones, proteasome), metabolic reprogramming towards conservation and repair, broad-spectrum detoxification, and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, we hypothesize that 'peripheral' modules will be activated by smaller, specific subsets of stressors and will be enriched for functions that directly counteract a particular insult, such as specific DNA repair enzymes for genotoxins or osmolyte transporters for osmotic shock. To test this, we will apply matrix factorization methods to our integrated multi-species expression dataset. The successful identification of a large, functionally coherent module activated across the majority of stress conditions, alongside smaller, functionally specific modules activated by distinct stressor classes, would validate our hypothesis. The primary deliverable for this aim will be a comprehensive catalog of core and peripheral stress response modules, functionally annotated and conserved across species.\n\n**Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the key regulatory hubs, such as transcription factors and signaling kinases, that orchestrate the Core Stress Response and integrate signals from diverse stress-sensing pathways?**\nWe hypothesize that the CSR is not a simple aggregation of independent pathways but is coordinated by a limited set of master regulatory hubs that function as signal integrators. We predict that these hubs will include well-established stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) like HSF1, ATF4, and p53, as well as key signaling nodes like the MAPK and TOR pathways. Our hypothesis states that these factors will be identified by network inference algorithms as having high centrality (e.g., degree, betweenness) and connectivity specifically to the genes within the CSR module. To test this, we will construct a global regulatory network from our expression data. We will then validate our computationally predicted hubs by cross-referencing with orthogonal public data, such as ChIP-seq databases (e.g., ENCODE) and kinase-substrate databases. We expect to find significant enrichment of the binding motifs for our predicted hub TFs in the promoter regions of CSR genes, providing strong evidence for their direct regulatory role. The expected outcome is a high-confidence map of the core regulatory circuit governing cellular resilience.\n\n**Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can a predictive model be built to accurately forecast the cellular response profile—specifically, the pattern of core and peripheral module activation—to a novel, uncharacterized stressor?**\nWe hypothesize that the cellular response signature is a predictable, emergent property determined by the type of damage a stressor inflicts. Therefore, a machine learning model can learn the relationship between a stressor's physicochemical properties or known mode of action and the resulting transcriptional and proteomic fingerprint. We predict that a model trained on our large, diverse dataset can forecast which specific combination of our previously defined modules will be activated by a new chemical or environmental insult. To test this, we will train a multi-label classification model (e.g., a random forest or neural network) using stressor features as input and the module activation state as output. We will rigorously evaluate the model's predictive power using a leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation strategy. Success will be defined by the model's ability to achieve high accuracy (e.g., AUC > 0.8) in predicting the activation profile for held-out stressors. The deliverable will be a validated, open-source computational tool for in silico toxicogenomics and stress response prediction.",
        "methods_and_approach": "This project will be executed by a multidisciplinary Working Group comprising a systems biologist (PI 1), a cell biologist/toxicologist (PI 2), and a data scientist (PI 3), along with their trainees. This structure ensures that deep expertise in computational analysis, biological interpretation, and statistical rigor are integrated at every stage. The project is organized into a logical progression of five phases with clear milestones.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Curation (Months 1-6)**\nThis foundational phase focuses on assembling the comprehensive dataset required for synthesis. We will perform systematic, keyword-based searches of public repositories, primarily NCBI GEO, EBI ArrayExpress (transcriptomics), and PRIDE/MassIVE (proteomics). Our search will target datasets from four key eukaryotic models: *S. cerevisiae*, *D. melanogaster*, *C. elegans*, and human cell lines (*H. sapiens*). Inclusion criteria are stringent: studies must contain appropriate unstressed controls, provide accessible raw or processed data, and have sufficient metadata to characterize the perturbation. We aim to collate over 500 individual datasets, encompassing more than 50 distinct stressors (e.g., heat shock, sodium arsenite, tunicamycin, doxorubicin, UV radiation, glucose starvation). A team of trainees, supervised by the PIs, will manually curate all relevant metadata into a standardized, machine-readable format. This curated metadata catalog will be a key project deliverable.\n\n**Phase 2: Unified Data Processing and Normalization (Months 4-9)**\nTo enable meaningful integration, data from disparate sources must be processed through a single, uniform pipeline to minimize technical artifacts and batch effects. For all RNA-seq datasets, we will download the raw FASTQ files and process them using a standardized workflow (e.g., STAR for alignment, featureCounts for quantification). For microarray data, raw files will be processed using platform-specific standardized methods (e.g., RMA). Proteomics data will be re-analyzed from raw spectra using a consistent search engine (e.g., MaxQuant). Following initial processing, we will apply advanced batch correction algorithms (e.g., ComBat-seq) to the combined expression matrices. The success of our normalization will be rigorously assessed using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), ensuring that biological variance (stressor type, cell type) dominates over technical variance (study of origin). Finally, to facilitate cross-species comparisons, all gene and protein identifiers will be mapped to ortholog groups using the OrthoDB database.\n\n**Phase 3: Decomposing the Stress Response (Aim 1; Months 10-18)**\nWith the normalized, integrated data matrix, we will address RQ1. We will employ Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an unsupervised machine learning technique well-suited for identifying component parts in complex biological data. NMF will decompose the expression matrix into a set of co-regulated gene modules and their corresponding activation patterns across all experimental conditions. We will determine the optimal number of modules using consensus clustering and model stability metrics. Each resulting module will be subjected to extensive functional annotation using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) against GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway databases. A module will be classified as 'core' if its activation pattern is significant across a high percentage (>75%) of diverse stress conditions; otherwise, it will be classified as 'peripheral'.\n\n**Phase 4: Inferring the Core Regulatory Network (Aim 2; Months 15-24)**\nTo identify the regulators of the Core Stress Response (CSR), we will apply network inference algorithms. We will use methods like ARACNE or GENIE3, which can infer regulatory relationships (e.g., transcription factor to target gene) from large-scale expression data. We will build a global regulatory network and identify hub proteins by calculating network centrality measures. To validate these computationally-derived hubs, we will perform two orthogonal analyses. First, we will test for the statistical enrichment of known transcription factor binding motifs (from databases like JASPAR) in the promoter regions of genes within the CSR module. Second, we will cross-reference our inferred regulatory links with experimentally-verified interactions from public ChIP-seq and protein-protein interaction databases.\n\n**Phase 5: Developing a Predictive Model (Aim 3; Months 20-30)**\nTo address RQ3, we will build a predictive model. For chemical stressors, we will generate a feature vector describing their physicochemical properties using tools like RDKit (e.g., Morgan fingerprints, molecular weight). We will then train a multi-label random forest classifier. The input to the model will be the stressor's feature vector, and the output will be a binary vector indicating the activation state ('on' or 'off') of each of our previously identified stress modules. The model's performance will be assessed using a rigorous leave-one-stressor-out cross-validation scheme, measuring metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall. A high-performing model will demonstrate that the cellular response is a predictable emergent property of the stressor's characteristics.",
        "expected_outcomes_and_impact": "This project is poised to deliver transformative outcomes that will significantly advance the field of molecular and cellular biology, with far-reaching impacts on biomedical research and environmental science. Our contributions will be both conceptual and practical, providing new knowledge, powerful resources, and a new generation of trained scientists.\n\n**Intellectual and Scientific Contributions:**\nThe primary outcome will be a paradigm shift in our understanding of cellular stress. By moving beyond the study of isolated pathways, we will deliver the first **Unified Map of the Eukaryotic Stress Response Network**. This map will detail the components of a conserved **Core Stress Response (CSR)** and a diverse array of stressor-specific peripheral modules. This provides a concrete, data-driven definition of cellular resilience, an emergent property that has been conceptually important but difficult to define mechanistically. Our identification of the **master regulatory hubs** that orchestrate the CSR will pinpoint the critical integration nodes in the cell's decision-making circuitry, revealing how diverse threat signals are channeled into a coherent survival program. These findings will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, fundamentally altering textbook models of cell biology.\n\n**Broader Impacts and Applications:**\nThe knowledge and tools generated will have significant translational potential. In **disease biology**, our framework will illuminate the common molecular underpinnings of aging and chronic diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration, which share a foundation of unresolved cellular stress. The regulatory hubs of the CSR represent novel therapeutic targets for developing 'resilience-enhancing' drugs that could broadly protect against age-related cellular decline. In **toxicology and drug development**, our predictive model (Aim 3) will constitute a powerful new **in silico screening tool**. It will enable the rapid prediction of a novel chemical's cellular impact and mode of action from its structure alone, reducing costs, accelerating safety testing, and aligning with the '3Rs' goal of reducing animal testing.\n\n**Open Science and Community Resources:**\nIn alignment with the research call's principles, all outcomes will be made openly available to the scientific community. We will develop a **publicly accessible web portal** that will serve as a central resource. This portal will provide interactive access to our integrated, normalized dataset, the defined gene/protein modules, the inferred regulatory networks, and our predictive model. This will empower researchers worldwide to explore our data, test their own hypotheses, and accelerate their research. All analytical code, pipelines, and workflows will be meticulously documented and shared on a public GitHub repository with a permissive open-source license, ensuring full reproducibility and reusability.\n\n**Training and Workforce Development:**\nThis project is intrinsically designed as a training platform. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be at the heart of the Working Group, receiving immersive, hands-on training at the intersection of cell biology, data science, and systems biology. They will gain invaluable skills in managing large-scale data, developing robust computational pipelines, and working within a collaborative, multidisciplinary team—precisely the skills needed for the future biomedical workforce. We will foster their development through regular joint lab meetings, an annual in-person 'data-thon' workshop, and co-mentorship from all PIs. This project will thus directly contribute to training the next generation of leaders in data-intensive biological research.\n\n**Long-Term Vision:**\nThis project will lay the foundation for a long-term, sustainable research program. The created data resource and analytical framework will be extensible, allowing for the future incorporation of new data types (e.g., metabolomics, epigenomics) and new organisms. The collaborative network established through this Working Group will foster follow-up projects, such as experimentally validating novel hub regulators or applying our predictive model in partnership with environmental agencies or pharmaceutical companies.",
