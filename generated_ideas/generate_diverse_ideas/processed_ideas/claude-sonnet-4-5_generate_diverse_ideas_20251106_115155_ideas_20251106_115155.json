        "research_call": "This funding organization is dedicated to catalyzing multidisciplinary scientific teams to synthesize publicly available data to address fundamental questions related to emergence phenomena in the molecular and cellular biosciences. It supports community-scale synthesis and integration of existing molecular and cellular data to: Answer novel questions Solve long-standing puzzles in the molecular and cellular sciences Develop innovative research and analytical strategies Tap diverse new talent Train the future data-savvy workforce A community-scale synthesis project has three defining characteristics. First, it uses only existing publicly available data and often integrates distinct datasets together. It does not generate any new experimental data. Second, the project is beyond the capabilities of most individual research labs and instead requires collaboration between two or more labs. Finally, such a project requires diverse scientific perspectives and expertise to come together, often resulting in novel, deeper, and broader insights. You research should focus on well-defined scientific questions or methodological developments that advance molecular and cellular sciences through synthesis research to acquire insights from a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach. This RFP invites proposals for Working Groups that will: Address Compelling Scientific Questions: Tackle novel and significant research questions in molecular and cellular biology through data synthesis. Stimulate Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Bring together researchers from diverse fields. Utilize Publicly Available Data: Leverage existing data sources to develop innovative research and analytical strategies. Require NCEMS Support and Resources: The proposed synthesis project must demonstrate a clear need for NCEMS support that goes beyond the capabilities of a single lab or existing collaboration. Promote Collaborative Partnerships: Assemble teams that reflect a range of scientific expertise, geographic locations, career stages, and institutional research levels. Adhere to Open Science Principles: Commit to making findings, data, and analysis workflows publicly available in accordance with community-created policies on open, team, and reproducible science. Train the Next Generation: Provide training opportunities to trainees (graduate students and postdocs) through collaborative research efforts within the working group."

          "abstract": "Cells retain molecular memories of past stress exposures that influence future responses, yet the mechanisms encoding this cellular memory across timescales remain fragmented across disciplines. This synthesis project will integrate epigenomic data (DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility), stress-response transcriptomics, metabolomic profiles, and protein modification datasets from organisms exposed to diverse stressors (heat shock, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation, hypoxia) to decode how cells encode and retrieve stress memories. By uniting epigeneticists, stress biologists, biochemists, and information theorists, we will analyze temporal patterns of molecular changes to identify memory-encoding mechanisms that persist after stress removal. The project will synthesize data from GEO, ENCODE, MetaboLights, and stress-response databases across yeast, plants, and mammalian systems to address: How long do different molecular memories persist? What determines memory stability versus erasure? How do cells integrate multiple stress histories? We will develop information-theoretic frameworks to quantify memory capacity in molecular networks, apply time-lagged correlation analyses to identify causal memory mechanisms, and use comparative approaches to distinguish conserved versus lineage-specific memory systems. This work addresses fundamental questions about cellular learning and adaptation that require integration of epigenomics, metabolomics, and stress biology data across multiple timescales and organisms—capabilities beyond individual laboratories. Deliverables include a stress memory atlas mapping molecular imprints across stressor types and durations, predictive models for memory formation and decay, open-source tools for temporal multi-omics integration, and training modules in quantitative stress biology. This resource will reveal how cells encode environmental history and inform strategies for priming stress resistance in agriculture and medicine."
